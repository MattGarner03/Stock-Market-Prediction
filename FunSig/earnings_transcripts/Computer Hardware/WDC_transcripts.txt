===== 2025 Q3  (2025-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Ambrish Srivastava, Vice-President and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Irving Tan, Chief Executive Officer; and Don Bennett, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion will contains forward-looking statements, based on management's current assumptions and expectations, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligations to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.wdc.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Irving Tan for introductory remarks.
Irving Tan: Thanks, Ambrish. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm honored to be speaking with you for the first time as the CEO of Western Digital. It is a privilege to lead this exceptional organization, and I want to start by recognizing the outstanding work of our employees across the company, who managed the complex separation process over the last several months, while also continuing to drive the strong performance we are reporting today. Throughout that time, they remain deeply connected to our customers, continued pushing the boundaries of leading edge innovation and sustained, a strong focus on operational excellence. This combination of customer focus, innovation and execution positions us well for the opportunities ahead. In the past month, we've also welcomed our new Chief Product Officer, Ahmed Shihab. Having held leadership positions at two large hyperscalers, Ahmed is a seasoned expert in cloud storage needs and requirements, making him the right person to lead our product strategy and engineering teams as we continue to drive innovation and deliver solutions that meet the evolving demands of our data-driven world. We are excited to have Ahmed join Western Digital as its customer centric perspective and deep industry knowledge, particularly with data centers, will be invaluable to us going forward. Let me now provide you with a few updates on our business. Since stepping into this role, I've been spending a great deal of time with our customers, employees and the investment community. What's clear to me is that, Western Digital has an incredibly strong foundation, a resilient business model and incredible potential to benefit from the demand in the age of AI. Even in a world marked by geopolitical uncertainty and shifting trade dynamics, one thing remains constant, the exponential growth of data. From enterprise workloads to the explosion of AI-generated content, such as the millions of images and viral videos generated through AI, data generation is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. When it comes to storing data at scale, no technology rivals the cost efficiency and the reliability of HDDs. We continue to serve as the backbone of the world's data infrastructure, delivering unmatched value for mass storage needs. As we deliver our critical HDD technology to our customers, we are focused on continued innovation to provide the highest capacity drives with improved performance, energy efficiency and lowest total cost of ownership. Our industry-leading 11 disk drives, with capacities of up to 26 terabyte CMR and 32 terabyte Ultra SMR, are now ramping rapidly with over 800,000 units shipped in the March quarter. We are also on track to ship well over 1 million units in the June. The swift qualification and adoption cycle is a hallmark of our technology road map, demonstrating reliability, ease of implementation and scalability with fastest time to value for our customers. On HAMR, we remain on track with respect to our milestones and road map that we communicated at our Investor Day in February. We are working closely on HAMR with two hyperscale customers and continue to receive encouraging ongoing feedback on our drives. Let me now turn to our quarterly results. For the third fiscal quarter, Western Digital delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 40.1% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. Free cash flow for the quarter was $436 million. At our Investor Day, we outlined the three pillars of our shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach. They are: to reinvest in the business, reduce debt, and return cash to our shareholders. On April 14th, we redeemed $1.8 billion of our 2026 senior notes, thus further strengthening our balance sheet. I'm also pleased to announce that, we are initiating a quarterly dividend of 0.1 per share in our fiscal Q4. These actions are underpinned by our strong belief in the strength and durability of our business. Don will cover this in greater detail in his remarks. Now turning to our outlook. First, I want to acknowledge the current environment, which remains highly uncertain and volatile, driven in a large part by tariffs and global trade tensions. At Western Digital, we are addressing these challenges on two fronts. In the near-term, we've established cross functional teams to minimize disruption and mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and operations. At the same time, we're taking a strategic view, evaluating the longer-term implications of supply chain shifts, to ensure we stay agile, resilient and are well-positioned for the future. Though the broader environment has some uncertainty, demand from our hyper-scale customers remains robust in a tight supply environment. We're thankful to our customers, who increasingly recognize the complexity of the HDD supply chain and are partnering with us to provide visibility into their future needs. This collaboration enables us to plan more effectively. And we now have long-term agreements to extend through the first half of calendar year 2026, with two of our largest customers. However, there are areas, such as in the enterprise and in certain parts of our distribution and retail business, where there could be more uncertainty with respect to demand, driven largely by the current tariff environment. Taking these factors into account and looking ahead into the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth, driven by sustained strength in data center demand. We continue to work closely with our customers to align with their long-term requirements, while delivering the best possible total cost of ownership. Let me now turn the call over to Don, who will discuss our fiscal third quarter results and fiscal fourth quarter guidance in more detail.
Don Bennett: Thank you, Irving, and good morning, everyone. In the fiscal third quarter, Western Digital delivered strong financial results and successfully completed the planned separation of the company's Flash business on February 21st. As such, the historical results for the Flash business segment are reported as discontinued operations and excluded from these results, unless otherwise noted in my comments. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, down 5% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.36, driven by gross margin of 40.1%, disciplined cost management and tax benefits. Total ex-white shipments were down 6% sequentially, driven by lower near-line shipments related to deployment plans of our customers. Average price per unit increased 4% sequentially to $179. Looking at end markets. Cloud represented 87% of total revenue at $2.0 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline was due to a 6% reduction in near-line bit shipments to 145 exabytes, while pricing per unit in cloud was up 5%. On a year-over-year basis, both revenue and bit shipments grew at 38% and 32% respectively, driven by the strength of our product portfolio. Client represented 6% of total revenue at $137 million, down 2% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Compared to last quarter and last year, revenue was down due to lower unit shipments. Consumer represented 7% of revenue at $150 million, down 13% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. The sequential decline in consumer was primarily due to lower unit shipments, while year-over-year the decrease was largely due to pricing. Moving to the rest of the income statement, please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results on a continuing operations basis, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 40.1%. Sequentially, gross margin improved 1.7 percentage points, ahead of our guidance of 50 basis points improvement. Operating expenses were down sequentially to $324 million. Our results demonstrate continued focus on cost discipline, as we concluded our business separation process. Operating income was $596 million, up 85 basis points sequentially, driven by higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenue. Operating margin was 26%, up 1.5 percentage points sequentially and up 17.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Income tax expense was $12 million and the effective tax rate for the fiscal third quarter was 2%. The decline in the company's effective tax rate from guidance is a result of the recognition of one-time deferred tax benefits, in conjunction with the separation of the Flash business. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of our fiscal third quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $3.5 billion and total liquidity was $4.7 billion including undrawn revolver capacity. Gross debt outstanding was $7.4 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Inventory was $1.3 billion, representing 86 days of inventory, up $63 million sequentially and down $174 million on a year-over-year basis. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the fiscal third quarter was 1.7x. Please note, after the close of the March quarter, we've successfully redeemed $1.8 billion of our 2026 senior notes using cash on hand. The redemption reflects our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet and achieving our target net leverage ratio of 1.0x to 1.5x, as outlined at our Investor Day. Operating cash flow for the fiscal third quarter was $508 million and cash capital expenditures represented a cash outflow of $72 million, resulting in free cash flow generation of $436 million for the quarter. Please note that, this is on a consolidated basis for the quarter. As Irving highlighted in his opening remarks, we are pleased to announce that we're initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.1 per share, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in the long-term, cash-generating ability of our business. This decision underscores our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. I'll now turn to the fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance. This guidance includes our current estimate of all anticipated or known tariff related impacts on our business in this period. We anticipate revenue to be $2.45 billion plus or minus $150 million. Gross margin is expected to be between 40% and 41%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly on a sequential basis to a range of $330 million to $340 million. The increase is due to variable compensation reflecting improvement in the underlying business, hiring to fill critical open positions resulting from the business separation and increased investments in research and development. Interest and other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $70 million. The decrease on a subsequent basis reflects our lower debt levels, following the notes redemption previously discussed. The tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. We expect EPS to be $1.45 plus or minus $0.20, based on approximately 360 million shares outstanding. Additionally, for modeling purposes, we would like to highlight that, fiscal year 2026 will be a 53 week year for us. As a result, our first fiscal quarter in FY '26 will have fourteen weeks. In addition, we expect the tax rate for FY '26 to be between 16% and 18%. In closing, Western Digital is well positioned to navigate the current dynamic environment. We remain focused on creating value for our stakeholders and investing in our future to capture the significant growth and data ahead, while maintaining a healthy supply and demand environment. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Irving.
Irving Tan: Thanks, Don. Western Digital's results this quarter and guidance reflect the ongoing structural transformation of our business, with continued progress towards a business that delivers sustained profitability. We continue to maintain strong conviction in the business, and are confident that we will weather this uncertainty and come out even stronger. With that, let's now begin the Q&A.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Irving. Operator, you can now open the line to questions, please. To ensure that we hear from as many analysts as possible, please ask one question at a time. After we respond, we will give you an opportunity to ask one follow-up question. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the nice quarter at the gate. Instead of asking a demand question, I wanted to actually ask about capital allocation. And so, Irving, you have a dividend yield of about 1% soon to be lower than that, given how your stock is trading in the pre-market. That's about $100 million of annual cash outflow. Can you maybe just help us understand how we should be thinking about both dividend growth going forward, given it seems like you have some capacity there, but then also maybe how you're thinking about potential share buybacks? And I know your intent is to de-lever with the ScanDisk stake, but just help us understand on the cash return side to equity holders, how we could be thinking about the cadence of both dividend growth and buybacks? Thanks so much.
Irving Tan: Yes, Erik. Thanks for the question and I appreciate it. As we laid out in our Investor Day, our goal is to get our net leverage down to the 1.15x range. And once we're there, we intend to return 100% of our excess cash to our shareholders and that will be in the form of both potential -- both dividend and share buybacks. As we also indicated at Investor Day, which we have honored and committed to today. We're starting off with a relatively small dividend to begin with. And then as we progress, we'll look to increase that and complement that with buybacks as well. So stay tuned for that.
Erik Woodring: Okay. Okay.
Irving Tan: And did you have a follow-up?
Erik Woodring: Yes. Just a quick follow-up was, Irving, what I hear from you is kind of more visibility because of some of these LTAs. And I'm just curious, with customers now giving you some indications into the first half of calendar '26, does that mean, you have enough visibility to expect revenue margins and EPS sequential growth through calendar '25, or is it too early to make that call? Thanks so much guys. Good luck.
Irving Tan: Yes, Erik, thanks. I think the shift to LTAs has given us greater visibility. And as I highlighted in my opening comments, we now have two hyper-scale customers that have given us LTAs up to the first half of calendar year 2026. And that's really helped us plan our supply chain appropriately along with the CapEx investments that we need to make and give us a lot more confidence in the business. And so, as I've highlighted in the past, I think especially when it comes to the hyper-scale business, we see demand continuing to be strong and robust throughout the calendar year '25 and now as I've mentioned into the middle of calendar year '26 as well.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Also congrats on the first quarter out of the gate. In the comments around the guidance you guys alluded to into the fiscal fourth quarter, you did point out that, it reflected all known or anticipated tariff impacts. I'm curious, if you could unpack that a little bit. I believe the majority, if not all of your manufacturing footprints in Thailand. So just curious how you're thinking about, how your best assessment of what these tariff impacts might be or any indications that you've seen with customers at this point?
Irving Tan: Hi, Aaron. Thanks for the question and good to hear from you again. In Q4, we don't anticipate any direct tariff impacts in relation to its translation into pricing or cost to customers. But where -- as we've highlighted in our prepared statements, we do see some potential demand uncertainty in the enterprise distribution and retail segments of the business, just due to the unpredictability and volatility. And you would have heard a lot of comments in the marketplace around enterprises and consumers sort of pausing or holding back on making purchases as well. So factoring all that in, that's the guide that we gave. But again, the growth that we've guided to is really driven primarily by the strength that we continue to see in the data centers, specifically in our hyper-scale business.
Don Bennett : And Aaron, I'll just add that, in Irving's prepared remarks, we talked about establishing cross-functional teams to minimize disruption and mitigation to both our customers as well as our internal operations. Additionally, we're taking a strategic view on looking at multiple alternatives, depending on what the tariff situation looks like tomorrow or in mid May or June, whenever the next round of tariff guidance comes out on our products. As you know, we're part of the semiconductor group and we currently have 0% tariff on our products.
Ambrish Srivastava: Aaron, did you have a follow-up?
Aaron Rakers: Yes, I do. Thanks, Ambrish. So when I think about the gross margin, right, 40.1%, I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 38% plus is kind of being the longer-term model. When I look at the guidance into this next quarter, if my math is right, it looks like the incremental margin that you're alluding to is like north of 45%. So I guess my question is, is there anything structurally in the business or kind of the path forward that keeps us from thinking that gross margin could trend into that mid-40%, if not higher range over time?
Don Bennett : Yes. I think, Aaron, at Investor Day, we provided a guide or a model on gross margin that was a floor of 38% and that's over a five year period. As you know, there are market vagaries and ups and downs along the way. So, 38% was the floor. We obviously were able to deliver very strong gross margins this quarter. We crossed a 40% threshold. And that's really driven by the value the customers see in the technology, that we are providing them as well as very strong operational discipline, and also pricing discipline that we've experienced within the market. So as we continue to deliver total cost of ownership value to our customers, innovation capability, whilst maintaining their operational discipline within the customers within our operations, sorry, we see gross margins continuing to remain strong.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Aaron.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. For my first question, I know you have focused on technology transitions to drive hexabyte demand from here. However, what are the hurdles for you to add manufacturing capacity? Is it driven by certain visibility you have on LTAs or other things we should consider? Thank you.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Karl. A lot of our exabyte growth has really been driven by aerial density improvement and technology improvement. As we've highlighted, our Ultra SMR technology, which is unique to us, gives us a 20% capacity uplift over the standard recording media. So our ability to deliver incremental exabytes without having to put in CapEx in terms of more production units has been one of the big differentiators that we've been able to create. And so, that's an area that we continue to invest in our R&D function to continue to drive greater aero density performance. We've recently just launched our 26 and 32 terabytes industry-leading platforms and will bring out in the next few months our 28 and 36 terabyte platforms as well. So those increases through aero density will continue to enable us to deliver exabyte growth without having to invest in CapEx for additional unit growth.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up, Karl?
Karl Ackerman: I do, Ambrish, please. Thanks for that, Irving. I wanted to follow-up on the comments you made with regard to LTAs. It sounds like demand for hyper-scale is quite good and has strong visibility into the first half of 2026. However, I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the growth curve of private cloud and SMB customers. I'm curious whether you have seen perhaps any pull forward in counter Q2 ahead of tariffs? And secondarily, how you think about the demand dynamic for those customers in the second half? Thank you.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thank you. We definitely do see opportunities, especially in sovereign clouds and private clouds going forward. Even in the age of AI, where the primary beneficiaries have been the large hyperscalers, we also see growth sort of at the edge happening. So, that's an opportunity that we look to pursue going forward, as well as a growth driver. We haven't seen any pull forwards. The linearity that we saw within Q3 was very consistent with the linearity that we've seen in the past. And then, also, as we look at sequential quote on quarter growth very consistent with what we've seen in the past. So no real change in terms of pull-ins both last quarter and what we see happening this quarter as well.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Karl.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess to follow-up on the prior question, I was hoping you could speak a bit about supply and what kind of exabyte growth you can get just from delivering higher capacity drives. And I guess, what is the timeframe, where you would potentially consider adding more capacity?
Irving Tan: Thanks for the question, C.J. Look, we feel confident right now with the forecast that we have and outlook that we see in terms of exabyte growth. We are able to deliver that through, again, the technology and innovation we're delivering that provides us that capacity uplift without putting in any capacity. If there was any need to put in any capacity, it would probably be more on the hidden media side of the house, but we don't anticipate any capacity investments in those areas for the near term.
Don Bennett: And C.J, I'll just add that in this uncertain environment, we're very tightly managing our capital expenditures and we continue to manage the business to the low end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up, C.J.?
C.J. Muse: I do, Ambrish. Thank you. I guess, could you speak to gross margins? Obviously, great results and guide. Curious, in terms of the drivers from here, is there still kind of a fixed cost benefit that would arise, or is it really all about higher capacity drives delivering higher ASPs? Is that the main driver, or are there other factors that we should consider? Thanks so much.
Irving Tan: Yes. C.J., you hit it right. It's really about the product technology that we're delivering to our customers. We continue to add TCO benefit to them, and we're participating in that value, that we're bringing to the customers. We're tightly matching supply and demand. So we're not going to see great impact from increased production over time, because we're very tight in our supply allocation. So it's really about delivering value to our customers through technology and continue to drive leading edge products at scale.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Nice results here. Irving, if I heard right in, you noted the potential for some enterprise slowdown driven by tariffs. I was curious, have you seen anything in your order patterns to suggest that or is this sort of more anticipatory in terms of what could happen, if a tariff regime became more onerous?
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. It's more the latter, right? We haven't seen any slowdown just yet. But obviously, there is demand uncertainty because of the tariffs. And obviously, we've heard a lot of news coming out of enterprises and earnings over the last few days, around customers being a bit more cautious in terms of spending and capital investments as well. So given that, we've just factored that into the guide. But nothing towards for the time being. Sorry, we've just widened the range in terms of our guide for Q4.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up, Wamsi?
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. Maybe for Don, as you look into the September where you're calling out the 14 weeks, any parameters you can help us think through in terms of revenue and OpEx into that quarter, please? Thank you.
Don Bennett: Yes. So we guide one quarter at a time, but the reason I mentioned a fourteen week is because obviously we'll have 14 weeks of expenses. Typically our customers order on a quarterly basis. So the revenue will be it'll follow typical seasonal patterns. But at this point, we're not guiding revenue for that quarter.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Wamsi.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the question and great quarter, by the way. Just, there seems to be some concern like just around hyperscalers. I know your competitor talked about demand being very strong there as well and good visibility. Just anything on why you don't think this could be double ordering? Anything, as it relates to the pricing negotiations that would limit the impact if indeed there was any double ordering? Thank you.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Asiya. We definitely don't see any double ordering at this time as I think one of the key things is we are in a very tight supply demand environment. So even if there were double orders, I think, we would be challenged to fulfill them, right now. And I think more importantly the demand profile that we're seeing given the LTA visibility that we have all the way to middle of 2026 is -- we're seeing order patterns very much follow the LTA demand. So there's nothing really abnormal. As Don mentioned, it follows very much both seasonality quarter-to-quarter and linearity within quarter as well. So we don't see any double ordering. If anything on pricing, obviously, as we transition to new platforms that always gives us an ability to deliver better TCO value to our customers and an opportunity for us to deliver greater pricing upside as well.
Ambrish Srivastava: Asiya, did you have a follow-up?
Asiya Merchant: Yes, sure. Thank you very much. On gross margins, it was better-than-expected in the current quarter that you reported. Why can't gross margins do similar incremental step-up? You are seeing better revenues in the June quarter. And then, as you think about the remainder of the calendar or the fiscal '26, should we continue to expect margin expansion from these levels? Thank you.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the strong gross margins that we have delivered and also guided to is a reflection of the value that we bring to our customers, particularly through the technology enhancements that really gives them both better TCO, but also very fast time to value. And that's what we continue to focus on. And, if we are able to continue to deliver that innovation, continue to deliver that total cost of ownership benefit and giving them fast time to value, we don't see any reason why gross margin could not expand going forward as well. So that's our focus. We don't worry too much about the gross margin, but continue to focus on delivering value to our customers and the gross margin will flow from that.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Asiya.
Operator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. I guess maybe just to start it on the tariff dynamic, I realize you don't have much impact on tariff right now. But, as you're signing these LTAs into calendar '26, can you talk about, if you sort of have tariff escalators embedded in them to ensure you can pass through the cost of these to your customers? Would that be a different set of discussions to be had once you know what the tariff scenario looks like?
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are obviously working very closely with our customers. As we all know, I think the situation is evolving on a daily basis and extremely fluid. So, it's hard for us to really speculate what the outcome would be. Right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and Don emphasized as well, we have teams that are working for company closely and for our customers to understand how we can mitigate impacts of tariffs and also any supply disruptions in the near-term. And then in the long-term, we're also evaluating with them in what their supply chain shifts may be so that we can also align to that. So we're also prepared both from a agility resiliency and long-term readiness perspective to be able to work for our customers as they shift their supply chains to be able to best support them as well.
Ambrish Srivastava: Amit, did you have a follow-up?
Amit Daryanani: I do. Thanks, Ambrish. And then maybe just on the HAMR side, I think you folks mentioned you're working with two cloud customers at this point on HAMR. Just any sense on when you expect these qualifications to happen? And as you work towards them, should we think of some sort of upside bias to your R&D or OpEx investments through that process? Thank you.
Irving Tan: Thanks for the question. I think we've laid it out very clearly at Investor Day. We are looking to start qualification in the second half of calendar year 2026 and then ramping up production at scale in the first half of calendar year 2027. We have engineering samples with two large hyperscalers already today. We're in close contact with them on the performance of those drives. We're getting regular feedback from them. I would say, so far, the performance has been meeting the milestones that we both laid out. And on a quarterly basis, based on the feedback that we receive from them, we are delivering the next generation of enhancements on those drives. So I'll say, we're comfortable with where we are. We're on track with that road map that we laid out. At the same time, we're also preparing to introduce our new 28 terabyte and 36 terabyte EPMR platforms as well. So our whole focus is on ensuring that, we really de-risk transitions for our customers continue to deliver very scalable, predictable, reliable capacity points that gives them the fastest time to value.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Amit.
Operator: The next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thomas O'Malley: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to focus in a little bit on the LTA. So, we had this period in memory on the NAND and DRAM side through the pandemic, where in the end, LTAs were pretty much torn up and were largely hyperscalers advantage over supplier. So, like, could you talk about like what benefit you get from these LTAs? Is this take-or-pay agreements? Are these in writing where you get some sort of compensation if your customers aren't going to take these, or is this just like a framework that you have with your customers that says, we will supply this much over this period of time? Could you just maybe dive into those a little bit? Because historically, they really haven't meant much.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question, Tom. First of all, we don't disclose the terms of the commercial contracts that we have. But, I think it's important to note, there's some quite significant structural changes that have happened within our business, I would say, across the entire hard drive industry, over the last year, where a lot of the excess capacity and existing inventory within the supply chain has been removed from the system to really reset the entire supply base, to where we think the right demand profile is going forward. The LTAs play a very critical role to ensure that, we have that right supply demand balance. And given the criticality that hard drives plays to the business of our hyper-scale customers, I think as I've mentioned in my opening comments as well, they've been working very closely with us to ensure, that sort of supply-demand imbalance that we saw during COVID and for post-COVID as well doesn't reoccur. And I think we're in a good place where the LTAs really give us good visibility. We're seeing pretty much demand stick to those LTAs that we've outlined with them with. The LTAs have moved from pretty much three to six months, now the 9 to 12 months as well. So that's giving us a lot more visibility to plan our supply chain very closely for our customers as well.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up, Tom?
Thomas O'Malley: Yes. I just want to dive into the differences between the unit and pricing in the guide. So, like, you had a pretty consistent track over the last couple of years of increased pricing. Is there any different type of dynamic we should think about? I know you guys don't guide by more than one quarter out, but looking into the June units versus pricing, any commentary you have that get you to that guide?
Don Bennett: Sure, Tom. Yes, we've had, as Irving mentioned, a structural change in our business. So the majority of our business today is in data centers, or at the edge. And so, we've seen this continued progression of ASP. Currently, we announced we're at $179, which is up 23% year-over-year on an aggregate weighted average basis. So, as that mix continues to move to cloud, we should see sustained increases in ASP. Obviously, it'll move around quarter-to-quarter, depending on what our client and consumer mix is, because that typically is a lower capacity drive overall. So, it's impacted by segment mix, customer mix, as well as we continue to drive TCO value to our customers. So we see price per unit stable or up in most cases as we deliver further technology into those accounts.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Tom.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first one, I just was curious if you could sort of give yourself a grade on the free cash flow for the quarter. It seemed pretty good to me at 78% of net income. And how we can think about sort of what you're measuring yourselves against in future quarters for free cash flow? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Don Bennett: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, free cash flow, we don't guide cash flow on a quarterly basis, because there's a lot of moving parts in cash flow. As you mentioned, we did have very strong both operating and free cash flow. We are driving the business to operating profit, and to free cash flow generation, so that we can execute on our capital allocation priorities. And Irving laid those out in the script, but I'll just repeat them. One is to reinvest in the business, so deliver leading-edge technology at scale to our customers. The second thing is to de-lever our balance sheet and you've seen us do that with taking out $1.8 billion of our 2026 notes. So we're now down below $4 billion of net debt on the balance sheet. And lastly is returning capital to our shareholders. We've started that with the initiation of the dividend and there'll be more to come on that in the future.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up, Steve?
Steven Fox: Yes. I was just curious when we think about non-enterprise and non-cloud markets, how you're managing those against all the demand you're seeing? Do you feel, like, you're deemphasizing those or figuring out a way to maybe more efficiently manage them? I'm just curious what we think about those markets over the next year? Thanks.
Irving Tan: Yes. We're definitely not de-emphasizing them. They're still a material part of our business. The supply chains for cloud and non-cloud business are really quite discrete and separate and we sort of manage them independently. If anything, we are looking at opportunities, to see whether we can sort of drive incremental growth in those areas.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.
Mark Miller: Congratulations on your first report for the spin out. I'm just curious, can you tell us how many shares you currently hold with ScanDisk? And have your plans changed because of the relatively low price of ScanDisk about what you're going to do with the shares?
Irving Tan: Yes, we own 19.9% of ScanDisk. That's the retained stake that we have. And, as we've communicated in Investor Day, we will look to disposition those shares, ideally, over a 12 month period starting in February, as part of our deleveraging strategy going forward.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. Back in February, the team outlined a three year near-line exabyte growth CAGR of around 20%, 25%, which is what some of the third-party research firms are kind of forecasting Irving, with the strong cloud data center CapEx spending trend that you talked about this year. Given your fairly good visibility, does your forward demand profile also suggest a low 20% exabyte growth profile in this calendar year or better?
Irving Tan: I think you're in the ballpark.
Ambrish Srivastava: Harlan, this is Ambrish. Remember, we had given a three to five year forecast?
Harlan Sur: Right.
Ambrish Srivastava: Did you have a follow-up, Harlan?
Harlan Sur: Yes. I know Irving had given a three to five year forecast, but that sort of 23% kind of aligns with some of what the third-party research guys are kind of forecasting for this calendar year, but appreciate the answer there. Also back in February, Irving, you did articulate about a 40%, like current mix of your near-line capacity was Ultra SMR based. As you look at your order book and shipment plans, where do you expect that mix to be either second half of this year or exiting this calendar year? And you're driving obviously strong TCO benefits, you're driving strong pricing power. But on a like-for-like basis capacity wise, which carries the higher gross margin profile? Is it your CMR or Ultra SMR based drives?
Irving Tan: I think we look to deliver value across the portfolio. So I think we see a pricing leverage across both our CMR and Ultra SMR platforms. Obviously, our Ultra SMR platforms give us better ESPs per drive, because of the additional capacity we deliver from it. It also helps us with CapEx, as I've highlighted earlier, because of the technology benefit we have without having to put CapEx into it. In terms of mix in any given quarter, it's probably around 40% to 45% ratio. So, it depends on -- because these are large hyperscalers and they have different deployment time frames and different hyperscalers use different technologies. So it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but somewhere between 40% to 45% in any given quarter is what we see.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting out the gate here as NewCo. I guess, yes, Ambrish, two if I could. I guess the first one is really an architectural question. So, as like assuming Seagate continues to progress with HAMR and you guys continue to progress over the next, call it, 24 months with your legacy tech, kind of pre-getting to HAMR volume just as for the Analyst Day. Does that create new any new architectural realities inside the data center with what can be mixed and matched or how folks begin thinking about storage system stacks? Would love any context there, if there's anything. And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks, Ambrish.
Irving Tan: Yes. Look, I think there will be some architectural adjustments accordingly. Obviously, at the highest level, the interplay between what's on Flash, what's on hard drives and what's on tape will continue to be there. As we've highlighted in Investor Day, hard drives again will be the predominant storage media with over 80% of bits stored on hard drives. We don't anticipate that changing whether that's EPMR or HAMR, going forward. There are some rack level changes that will be required for the deployment of HAMR. So, you're not going to be able to mix and match the drives that easily. Similar to Ultra SMR, there are some whole site software changes that are required as well. But, these are very sophisticated customers. Their data center architects are very familiar with what's needed to be done. And again, the success that we've had and the continued growth that we see in our Ultra SMR portfolio is a great example of people really embracing the technology and really making and investing in the architectural changes, within both their data center environment and their software stack, to be able to take advantage of that benefit and we see that going forward.
Ambrish Srivastava: You have a follow-up on that?
Ananda Baruah: Yes, thanks. Maybe this is for Don. I guess the March gross margin, am I correct, in recalling that March gross margin was actually originally anticipated to be impacted by product transition, yield dynamics, normal stuff? And, if that did in fact occur, does that actually mean that the normal the structural margin is actually set up higher than what you guys reported?
Don Bennett: I think we guided at 50 basis point improvement. We actually saw better yields and utilization. The ramp of our new product technology was faster-than-expected, as we announced in our press release. So we shipped over 800,000 units of our new 11 disc platform. That's being produced at very high quality, reliability and yields in our factory today. So that was one of the things that improved gross margin above guide.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Anand.
Operator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Your main competitor recently announced their intention to acquire Intevac. And I want to learn more how you're thinking about procuring the key components for HAMR technology, especially as you engage with two hyperscalers that you highlighted in the prepared remarks. And I have a follow-up.
Irving Tan: Yes. First and foremost, I think the Intevac acquisition by our peer doesn't have any impact on us, because we have obviously two sputtering systems that we use. So, we have resiliency within our technology supply chains, as well. We're obviously looking out for opportunities in which we can continue to capture even more value and accrete even more value to our products through potential acquisitions and vertical integration. So we continue to keep a lookout for them. In many cases, in terms of tool providers, we actually do feel and our philosophy is that, they actually benefit from actually servicing multiple customers, because that's how they can innovate better as well, but that's generally our rule of thumb. But, we're constantly looking at opportunities to see how we can continue to vertically integrate and capture more value within our portfolio.
Ambrish Srivastava: Do you have a follow-up Mehdi?
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. And a follow-up has to do with the CFO search, especially since you're executing well right out of the gate and committing to dividend, cash dividend? And to what extent, what's the update on the CFO search? And how should we think about the execution and search for the CFO?
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, I really must thank Don for agreeing and stepping into the interim CFO role. He has done a great job, as you can hear from the results, as well. The search is progressing very well and we'll communicate in due course once we have a CFO identified.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Mehdi.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Drive units were down from 13.5 million down to like 12.1 million in March. So is 13.5 million is that kind of like should we think about that as the high watermark for the number of drives you could produce in a quarter?
Irving Tan: I wouldn't use that as a watermark. I think it really depends on mix. It also depends on the various capacities that we are delivering. As Don mentioned, the teams continue to do a great job on really pushing the boundaries of yield and output that we can within the supply environment that we have. So, again, it fluctuates really based on yield and the mix of products that we have.
Don Bennett: And I'll just add there's segment mix client and consumer was down for the quarter as we ramp into seasonal periods with Prime Day and back-to-school and Christmas. We may see some of that volume come back in the client consumer space as well, and we have capacity there to expand.
Ambrish Srivastava: Did you have a follow-up, Tim?
Tim Arcuri: I do, yes. Just back on this question about these LTAs. I mean, these same large customers have similar deals for memory and they routinely overstate what they need. So, why would they not be doing that with you as well? So, I mean, I certainly understand that, demand is good. But, for this stuff that is booking out to next year, why would they not if they need two drives, why would they not tell you that they need three? And if they didn't take the drive, are you going to enforce a cancellation policy on that? Thanks.
Irving Tan: Yes. Look, I think we've got into a good healthy relationship with our customers. They have understood that, in order for a hard drive industry to be healthy for us to continue to be able to be profitable and invest in innovation that they benefit from a TCO advantage. It's in both our best interest to provide as best as possible the demand outlook, given the long lead times, especially when it comes to near-line drives. So that's something we've clearly gotten visibility. And in fact, for the two LTAs that we have into the first half of calendar 2026, we actually have some POs associated with them as well. I guess the question is, do we put in a clause around take-or-pay? To be frank, we're not a fan of that because all you're doing is creating problems down the road. And so, we'd rather work with our customers to smooth out demand and make sure we continue to work with them to have the right and appropriate supply-demand balance to sustain a profitable business that we can continue to invest in innovation for them going forward.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Tim.
Operator: The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, just a quick question on the HAMR side. When you look at the two hyper-scale customers you mentioned, is that -- are you still looking at ramping those like in calendar '26, like second half twenty six, I think, as you mentioned on the Analyst Day event?
Irving Tan: Yes. So as per the road map we've communicated, which has been shared with our customers for quite a while, at Analyst Day was when we made it more public to the general population, but that road map has been done in partnership for customers for quite a while. Just to reiterate what we shared, we're looking to start qualifications in the second half of calendar year of 2026, with high volume production ramp in the first half of calendar year 2027.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the tariff side, just a quick clarification. When you look at shipping into China, is that going from your Malaysia facilities or do you ship hard drives into China? And likewise, in The U.S., how much of that is you have production here versus coming in from Malaysia, et cetera? If you can give us a little bit of color around that. Thanks.
Irving Tan: Yes. We have production facilities throughout Asia. So, none of our products that we ship into The U.S. is coming from China. Most of it's coming in from Southeast Asia. Products going to China are not subject to any tariffs. As of April 11th, products that we ship into The U.S. are also not subject to any tariffs. Obviously, that situation is evolving and fluid, so we stay very close to it.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Vijay.
Operator: Thank you. The last question comes from Krish Shankar from Citi Cowen. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Eddie for Kirsh. How should the investors think about the impact from rare earth export control from China? I think, historically, you guys were able to recycle some of these metals, but at some point, it did impact your margins. I just wonder, if down the road, it's an area investors should be thinking about.
Irving Tan: Yes. Thanks for the question, and it's a good one. We over the last few years have really been on a supply chain resiliency program, where we have been able to develop alternate sources of supply for both rare earth and precious minerals as well. So, we don't anticipate there being any material impact as a result of some of those controls.
Ambrish Srivastava: Did you have a follow-up?
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. Thanks, Irving. And as you guys ramp the 11 disc platform, how should we think about the margin impact? Because my understanding is as you add discs, it may reduce the gross margin equation, or do you think it's at a point where it's mature enough where margins would be unaffected by that ramp? Thank you.
Don Bennett: Yes. So the margin accretion is included in our guidance. So we factor the ramp of the new technology into guidance.
Irving Tan: Yes. Maybe just to add on to Don's comment. We were already ahead of our ramp plans in Q3. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we shipped over 800,000 units of that new 11 disc platform. We'll be shipping well over 1 million units in Q4. We are seeing very high yields and productivity coming out of those platforms. So I guess to your question, they're actually margin accretive as opposed to being dilutive.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Irving Tan, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.
Irving Tan: Thank you all very much for joining us today, and it's very exciting to have our first quarter out as a standalone HDD company. As you can see from the results in the guide, we're executing well on our strategy that we've laid out at Investor Day, really being focused on our customers, driving leading-edge innovation, being extremely disciplined on operational excellence and having rigorous financial discipline and a very capital-friendly return policy, this quarter and the guide that we have shared, I think, truly reflects that. We thank you for your ongoing interest in WDC, and I look forward to catching up with all of you in due course.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q2  (2025-01-29 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's second quarter fiscal 2025 conference call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice-President, Financial Planning and Analysis, and Investor Relations. You may begin sir.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends, and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2025 performance. As many of you know the completion of our separation later in the fiscal third quarter, I will become the CEO of SanDisk. As a result, this will be my last earnings call as the CEO of Western Digital. Before we dive into our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude to our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their unwavering support throughout my tenure. It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve as the CEO of Western Digital and I’m immensely proud of what we’ve accomplished together to position both of our franchisees for long-term success as standalone companies. Now onto the results. For the second fiscal quarter Western Digital delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 35.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.77. Our commitment to enduring quality and reliability driven by our industry leading innovation and diversified portfolio has enabled us to navigate the current market's dynamics effectively. While our HDD business is experiencing robust growth, particularly in high capacity enterprise drives, our Flash segment faces temporary headwinds due to pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we are strategically well positioned to capitalize on growing long-term storage demand from the AI data cycle. Our HDD business continues to perform well, propelled by our cutting edge Ultra SMR technology. This innovation allows us to push the boundaries of storage capacity while maintaining the gold standard in reliability, quality and performance. The market has responded to our products enthusiastically, driving our HDD revenues to a 12 quarter high with a record non-GAAP gross margin. We're seeing increasing adoption of our newer and higher density drives, underscoring their ability to meet the evolving demands of the storage market. I'm pleased to report that we're in the final stages of our plan to separate our Flash and HDD businesses and expect this to be completed on schedule. During the second fiscal quarter, we achieved two crucial milestones completing our Form-10 filing and finalizing key financing activities necessary for the separation. Thanks to the meticulous planning and dedication of our teams, we're ready to operate as independent entities. We invite you to join us for our upcoming Investor days on February 11th for SanDisk and February 12th for Western Digital, where our respective management teams will share their strategic visions and demonstrate how each business will drive shareholder value as standalone entities. We anticipate that within a few weeks after the Investor Days, Western Digital and SanDisk shares will begin trading as independent companies. Turning to our business units. In Flash, revenue was stable and in line with expectations. Strength in client and consumer resulted in better than expected bit shipments. However, increased pricing pressure due to short term oversupply from increased utilization rates throughout calendar year 2024 coupled with customers working down inventory offset our bit shipment results. Cloud pricing was a positive given continued AI driven demand. Taken together, the result was sequential decline in profitability. In fiscal year 2024, consumer experienced growth across revenue units and gross margins as the end market benefited from a market recovery. While revenue and units grew sequentially in the fiscal second quarter of 2025 gross margin declined due to pricing pressure caused by oversupply in the broader NAND market. Despite this recent softening, our external SSD drive shipments grew 50% sequentially. Our efforts in bolstering consumer preference, expanding partnerships and launching our new creator series at CES all provide SanDisk with the right foundation to drive organic demand and margin expansion. Now turning to the Flash outlook, we believe that we are currently in a mid-cycle pause. In the fiscal third quarter, we expect bit shipments to be down with stronger demand in data center and mobile more than offset by lower bit shipments in PC OEM and consumer. Given the stronger than anticipated pricing headwinds, we are proactively managing production levels to respond to ongoing inventory adjustments and evolving demand dynamics across our end markets. By optimizing utilization and total capacity with a key focus on delivering premium nodes, we aim to accelerate stabilizing profitability in this dynamic market. In this new era of NAND, with lower utilization and less intense CapEx environment relative to historical periods, we are seeing supply growth appropriately responding to the current short term headwinds affecting demand and we expect to see a recovery as we move through calendar year 2025. Specifically, we expect client inventory digestion to continue into the first half of calendar year 2025 with normalization in the second half paving the way for recovery that will enable the AI driven PC ramp in the Windows refresh cycle to gain momentum. In data center, we project Cloud CapEx to continue to grow in calendar year 2025 and we continue to make good progress qualifying our cloud products with customers to capture our fair share of this market. Lastly, our consumer business continues to perform well and while we expect seasonal weakness in bit shipments, our premium brands are providing ASP support to the overall portfolio. We look forward to discussing our views on the Flash business at the SanDisk Investor Day on February 11th. The team and I will discuss why we believe that our markets are strong and growing, how rapid adoption of AI is creating new opportunities, what differentiates SanDisk and how the Flash industry is evolving. We are very excited and believe you will be as well. Our HDD business delivered another quarter of strong performance with data center revenue hitting an all-time high. This achievement underscores the strength of our near line storage solutions and how well positioned we are to benefit from ongoing market tailwinds. The HDD business also achieved record gross margins as customers continued to increase the adoption of our higher capacity drives and we shared in the TCO benefit provided by our innovative products. We are operating in an environment where demand for our product exceeds supply. To proactively manage this, we continually work with our customers to get visibility into their future needs. In these tight conditions, we might see volatility in shipments from quarter to quarter, but over the longer-term we continue to progress toward a state of predictable business operations and sustainable profitable growth. Turning to the HDD outlook. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate continued momentum in data center to drive strong demand across our nearline portfolio. As I mentioned, our supply is now very tight which is helping us get better visibility into long-term customer demand and enabling better planning for product deliveries in the coming quarters. Our customers increasingly appreciate the complexity of the HDD supply chain and the need for us to better anticipate future demand. As we continue to broaden adoption of our UltraSMR portfolio at our largest customers and complete the qualification and ramp of our newest drives, we anticipate profitability will continue to improve in the coming quarters. The HDD business positive structural transformation continues to gain momentum. We remain focused on operational excellence, efficient cost structure and a strong commitment to maintaining a balanced supply demand dynamic. We are well positioned to continue delivering the most profitable and innovative product portfolio while establishing long-term industry leadership through our earnings potential. During the upcoming WD Investor Day on February 12, Irving and his team will provide a detailed overview of HDD's strategic roadmap. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the CFO transition announcement that we made two weeks ago. After nearly three years with us Wissam will be moving on to another opportunity. Wissam has been an outstanding partner and leader at Western Digital, helping us successfully navigate the company through the ups and downs of our end markets and build a strong financial profile at both HDD and Flash. On behalf of the Board and everyone at Western Digital, I want to thank Wissam for his many contributions, including seeing us through the separation, and wish him the best of luck in his next role. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you David, and good afternoon everyone. In the fiscal second quarter, Western Digital delivered results generally within the guidance ranges we gave in October in the face of a challenging pricing environment in Flash. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, up 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.77. Looking at end markets, Cloud represented 55% of total revenue at $2.3 billion, up 6% sequentially and more than doubling year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the growth was due to an increase in nearline HDD shipments, while Flash was down. On a year-over-year basis both HDD and Flash revenue grew. Client represented 27% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. Compared to last quarter, Flash revenue declined as bid shipment growth was offset by pricing pressure while HDD revenue was flat. Year-over-year an increase in Flash revenue was primarily due to higher ASPs as bid shipments declined and was partially offset by lower HDD revenue. Consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, both Flash and HDD bid shipments grew and drove revenue growth while pricing was a headwind. Year-over-year the decrease was due to lower shipments in Flash and HDD and pricing in Flash. Turning now to revenue by business unit. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.9 billion flat from last quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 13% on a like-for-like basis and 10% on a blended basis. Bit shipments were up 9% from the previous quarter and down 2% compared to last year. HDD revenue was $2.4 billion, up 9% sequentially and 76% year-over-year. The strength of our nearline portfolio delivered exabyte growth of 7% on a sequential basis and 93% versus a year ago. Average price per unit increased 5% sequentially to $172. Nearline bid shipments were at a record level of 154 exabytes. Moving to the rest of the income statement, please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 35.9% which was below our guidance range. Sequentially, gross margin was down 2.6 percentage points and up 20.4 percentage points from a year ago. Flash gross margin was 32.5%, down 6.4 percentage points sequentially due to pricing pressure late in the quarter. Flash gross margin was up 24.6 percentage points from a year ago. In HDD, strong demand for nearline drives resulted in gross margin improvement of half a percentage point on a sequential basis to 38.6% and 13.8 percentage points from a year ago. Operating expenses were down sequentially at $674 million including the synergy expenses of $17 million. Lower than expected operating expenses were due to the synergy costs being lower than expectations while progress towards executing the SanDisk spin remains on track. In addition, variable compensation was lower than expectations aligned with business performance. Our results demonstrate continued focus on cost discipline while making progress towards the completion of the business separation. Operating income was $864 million, down 2% sequentially driven by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin was 20.2%, down approximately 140 basis points sequentially but favorable compared to operating losses posted last year. Income tax expense was $105 million and the effective tax rate was 14%. Earnings per share was $1.77. Operating cash flow for the fiscal second quarter was $403 million and free cash flow generation was $335 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $68 million. Fiscal second quarter inventory was largely flat at 3.4 billion, with days of inventory declining by 9 days to 112 days. A decrease in HDD inventory was offset by an increase in flash inventory. Gross Debt outstanding was $7.4 billion at the end of fiscal second quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion and total liquidity was $4.5 billion, including undrawn revolver capacity. During the fiscal second quarter we successfully arranged financing for the upcoming separation of our business, which is a key milestone in the progress towards the spin of SanDisk. I'll now turn to the fiscal third quarter non-GAAP guidance for Western Digital on a combined basis. We anticipate overall revenue to be in the range of $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 31.5% and 33.5%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $700 million to $720 million including the synergy costs of $25 million to $40 million as we finalize the separation of our businesses. Interest and other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $100 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 16%. We expect EPS of $0.90 to $1.20 based on approximately 358 million shares outstanding. We are looking forward to both of our Western Digital and SanDisk Investor Days in just a couple of weeks to discuss each business in more specific detail. For now, I provide directional perspective on expectations from each business in the fiscal third quarter. For Flash we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the mid-teens percentage and gross margin to decrease due to lower blended ASPs, higher cost per bit and underutilization charges of $20 million to $30 million as we manage our supply. Flash bits are expected to decline sequentially by mid-single digit percentage. We also expect underutilization charges to continue in the June quarter. For HDD we expect revenue to decrease sequentially by mid-to-high single digit percentage on lower volume. While gross margin is expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points as average price per unit continues to trend higher. We are focused on executing the final stages of the spin and navigating current market dynamics while continuing to deliver robust financial performance. I would like to close by saying that it has been a tremendous honor to partner with David and the fantastic team at Western Digital. I'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments over the past three years. There is no doubt in my mind that both the HDD and Flash businesses are strong and resilient and both will continue to provide industry leading products to the marketplace while unlocking significant shareholder value for the respective shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Wissam. Our results this quarter reflect our efforts to actively manage near term cyclicality across our end, knowing we have a solid foundation for future success that is underscored by our industry leading product roadmap. As we complete the separation, I am extremely confident in our respective team's ability to drive shareholder value in both the HDD and Flash businesses. Both companies will continue to be driven by the structural long-term tailwinds of the AI data cycle and our ability to consistently offer our customers the most compelling and innovative storage solutions. Before we move to the Q&A session, I'd like to highlight that we will also be joined today by Irving Tan, who will step into the role of CEO at Western Digital, and Luis Visoso, who will assume the position of CFO at SanDisk. Peter, let's start the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer portion of today's call. One moment please for the first question and today's first question comes from C.J. Muse at Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the HDD side, you talked about a sequential decline for the March quarter. Curious, is that a function of simply lower client and consumer units, or are you also seeing a pause in cloud? And within that construct, can you speak a bit more about your prepared remarks related to expectations for volatility, Q-on-Q and HDD? Trying to better understand what's really driving that underlying change.
David Goeckeler: Hey C.J., thanks for the question. I'm going to let Irving take that one.
Irving Tan: Thanks, David. Hi C.J. look, I think we've seen over five quarters of very strong positive growth in revenue and the outlook for the business remains healthy. There will be quarter-on-quarter variations as we support customers with the timing of their deployments and also balancing the supply demand tightness that we have. So that's really what's driving the slight decline in Q3.
C.J. Muse: Great, very helpful. And I guess Dave, a question for you two part. First, what gives you the confidence that this is just a mid-cycle pause and then within the spin of the NAND asset, are there any other sort of technical regulatory things that we should be thinking about that are necessary to get that done in the next four weeks? Thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: On the spin, you'll see more about that literally the next couple days. We feel really good about that being on track. Wissam can go through some of the dates here in a minute. Look, on the NAND we’re still seeing, bits were up 9% this quarter. They're going to be down just mid-single digits next quarter. We're still seeing good volume. We think some of the demand that we expected to materialize in PC and smartphone has moved to the right a couple of quarters. I don't think that's any secret. We, the industry probably overproduced a little bit too much. We don't see a big drop in the volume. We see still good, good discussions with our customers. It's just the market's oversupplied right now. So we saw some pricing headwinds especially as we move through the quarter which we talked about. Going forward, we expect pricing headwinds next quarter but we expect them to be lower than we saw this quarter. So we feel like this is a pause but we're also going to take, action. As we talked in the past, this new era of NAND, we're going to be much more responsive to the demand signals we see in the market and adjust our production. So we're going to go ahead and do that and take a little bit of supply out of the market as we move through 2025 and we think that will support pricing stabilization coming back faster. So feel good about where the overall business is. We've had a number of quarters of an upcycle now. Really quite unusual when you look going back, we have a chart here that goes all the way back to 07 and the sequential price changes in the market. And it's very, very unusual. It's not unprecedented to see this many quarters of up in a row without some down. So, the thing here now is just to stabilize the market and we'll do that through the supply side and then we'll get back to what we think is a strong market as we move through 2025 and into 2026.
Irving Tan: And C.J. just to follow on David's comments around the spin and the timing, the record date for the distribution will be February 12th and the date of the distribution will be on or about February 21st. And then the shares of SanDisk would be trading in the active markets shortly after.
C.J. Muse: Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.
C.J. Muse: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon as well. I guess thinking about the NAND gross margins, I'm wondering if you can unpack if I think about the 20 to 30 million that you talked about as being underutilization charges in the current quarter. If I look back the last time that you took capacity out, that looks like that's around 10% or 15% of the underutilization charges you took a year or so ago. Is that how I think about how much capacity out you're taking? I think the other way of asking it is, I look at some of your competitors and the news is that they're taking -- or so percent of their bit supply out. Is that a fair assessment of what you guys are doing?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we're not going to go into exactly how much we're taking out. That's a dynamic decision we make week-over-week, month after month as we look at the business. I think unpacking the gross margin is an important discussion as we go into next quarter. I think one thing for all of you guys to recognize, we're going to see a quarter of cost increases. We managed to that 15% cost decline. We talked about the new era NAND that maybe be more about 12% as we go forward over the next several years. But we had a very good start to the year in cost downs and now we're going to see Q3 were actually up low single digits. So that's a big impact on gross margin. You add underutilization charges on that and then some ASP headwinds as well. Like I said, as we sit here today, we see the ASP headwinds to be moderating versus what we saw this quarter and then bits down mid-single digits. So that kind of gives you unpacking a little bit the gross margin number going forward.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, that's very helpful. And just to kind of build on that, is there any way to frame how we should think about the underutilization impact into the fiscal fourth quarter? And just to be clear, is there any risk of inventory charges taken based on the current market dynamics? Thank you
David Goeckeler: I think you can probably think about Q4. They'll come up just. They'll come up a little bit from where we were in what we expect in Q3. Maybe think about it, maybe 60, 40 kind of split or 40, 60 kind of split.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. And on the inventory, Aaron, look, it all depends on what pricing does. And so -- but as of the end of Q2, our inventory is appropriately stated.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, thank you.
Wissam Jabre: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Dave or Irving. Can you talk about just at a high level where we are in the HDD cycle overall, I think, Dave, you said in your prepared remarks a few times that demand is exceeding supply. Like the calendar Q1 guide is to be down sequentially slightly. So can you help us unpack if that is just seasonality, is there something beyond that? And how should we think about pricing as we think about 20, 25 and maybe the maximum amount of exabytes that you can ship, given that supply is so tight at the current time. And I will quick follow up.
David Goeckeler: I'm going to let Irving Talk about 2025. I have enormous confidence in this business and enormous confidence in Irving driving it forward and the entire team. Going into the next quarter, you're going to see some revenue, revenue down a little bit on volume. Look, it's been quite a run. I mean, it's, we got to manage the supply chain, all the components. We do have much more visibility to where our customers are going. It's just order flow. We continue, we're going to continue to see margin improving going into next quarter. So structurally, I think the business is just in a fantastic place, we're getting more visibility, we have increasing profitability and we've got a lot of tailwinds from AI. More demand than supply. But let me let Irving talk about how he sees 2025 playing out.
Irving Tan: Yes, thanks, David. As I mentioned briefly, we see the outlook for 2025 still being relatively robust going forward. And as David mentioned, there will be some slight variations quarter-on-quarter, but the outlook for the rest of the year is relatively robust. In terms of pricing, as Wissam alluded to as well, we're looking at pricing to remain stable to slightly up for Q3. And in terms of exabytes, it's really a function of mix. And as we look forward to qualifying our new 32 terabyte drives, that gives us more capacity to provide into the market from an exabyte perspective as well.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks.
Wamsi Mohan: As a follow up, can I just ask quickly, on the NAND side, I think you used the word temporary weakness? And I'm just wondering, as you think about some of the actions that you're taking from a supply standpoint, what kind of assumptions are you making around demand recovery, whether it be on PC side or smartphone side, into maybe the second half of the year and is that the timeframe when you're thinking that the market gets tight again? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean, we think as we move through 2025, we're going to see, by the time we get done with 2025, we'll see PC units up, we'll see smartphone units up. Data center continues to remain strong. So we, the demand side, we see that mid-teens demand for the calendar year, we see the market slightly under supplied to that, quite frankly, you didn't ask the question. But we see a bigger step up in demand in 2026. But let's, let's stay with 2025 for now. So, so as I said earlier, we still see good volume in the business. Discussions with customers are very good. We're just in a spot right now where some of that demand we thought was going to come in the PC and smartphone market around this time has been pushed out a little bit. And so we're going to make some adjustments in our supply to support pricing and we think we'll be good as we move throughout 2025. We're very, very optimistic on where we're at from when we again we go back and we look at overall wafer spending in this market. We think that the market is set up in a very strong position. As I said earlier, we've had a very good run of price increases, almost unprecedented. When you go back over the last decade, it's not surprising we'd see some kind of pause like this and we'll. I think what's different this time is we're going to adjust supply much more quickly than we have in the past to respond to this and accelerate bringing the market back to a more of an equilibrium, to an undersupplied position.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Wamsi.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Archeri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Ari and on for Tim. Thanks for taking my question. It is one thing when you and Seagate had excess capacity, but it seems like you really can't ship much if any more than the 13.5 million drives you're shipping and now passing above this 10 year trend line. I would think that maybe there's more urgency from the customers on getting in orders for BTO. So any change in behavior and I will follow up after.
David Goeckeler: Yes, we haven't seen any change. Thanks for the question. We haven't seen any change in behavior. As you're aware, one of the things we've pivoted to is really moving to BTO. That's giving us a lot more visibility on a 52-week time horizon so that we can better plan with our customers and ensure we have the right supply demand balance and that's really ensuring that there's not buildup of inventory within our customer environments.
Unidentified Analyst: And then on the -- my follow up on the NAND side, the NAND cycle just got started and we turned capacity back on. Now we're going through another correction on the consumer side. And so what would you do once this is a standalone business? Are you still going to care at all about market share or will you do more like what you did on the HDD and manage to driving margins higher with less regard per share? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, that's a question for our investor day on the 11th and we're going to talk about that in quite a bit of detail. So we'll have a lot to say about that here in another week and a half. But I think the way we're managing the business now is what you're going to see more of going forward. We were very clear, we put out a pretty big webcast on the new era of NAND about how we thought about this business, how it's changed in the 3D era, how we our belief and how it needs to be managed. And I think you're seeing that play out in real time here this quarter. And we'll talk about that in more detail here in a couple weeks and we'll hope to see you in New York.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you, guys.
David Goeckeler: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could give us an update on Enterprise solid state drives. I know there's been some choppiness in that segment. Are you still tracking your targets and just how are you, how are you doing there?
David Goeckeler: Hey, Joe. Yes, we're doing fine there. We're still tracking the targets. There is some -- there. I think I said during the quarter we're in for a couple choppy quarters and I think that's what we're seeing. That was a highlight last quarter, certainly from supporting pricing. We still feel good about our 15% plus 15% to 20% of mix as we're sitting here at the halfway point through the year. This is another thing we're going to have a lot to talk about our investor day about kind of what our roadmap looks like in Enterprise SSD. But we're still seeing strong demand there, Joe.
Joe Moore: Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just more of a procedural question, but is there a time where you'll give guidance for the two businesses separately? Does that happen at the analyst days at the spin and form 10 just or just how should I think about that?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we'll talk more about that at the investor days. I think with Wissam’s prepared remarks, he gave you enough guidance there that you can kind of get a very good idea of what the numbers are going to be. But we'll reinforce that here in another 10 days.
Joe Moore: Okay, thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Thomas O'Malley of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thomas O'Malley: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about CapEx. You're starting a new calendar year here and I'm sure you'll give us a broader update at the analyst day. But given the reduction in utilization and just a broader pause, you're saying kind of a mid-cycle pause in the business. Any update on how you're thinking about spend on the Flash side? You've talked about technology transitions. It sounds like the SSD business is going through a couple of lumpy quarters just with all of those factors in. Any additional color on how you think about spending on the NAND side of the business, particularly? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Hey Tom, thanks for the question. So look, there's no change in the approach on CapEx. As we've said all along, we want to stay, remain disciplined in how we deploy the cash and capital for the company. Obviously, probably the next thing over time will be just at some point ramping the next node, but from an overall perspective, there's no real change on the thinking. I'm pretty sure as we get to investor day, David and Luis will have much more to add on that as well.
Thomas O'Malley: Yes, helpful. And then pivoting to the HDD side. So Seagate has given us some framework for where they think their capacity kind of hits a wall on the HDD side that's about 160 exabytes on a quarterly basis. You guys have kind of gotten, I believe in this last quarter to around 175 exabytes. Could you help us understand where you guys start running into a wall in terms of capacity? You've talked about some capacity drawdown potentially into the March quarter. But is there a similar framework that you guys go by? Just historically the market has been a little bit different than you guys being ahead in terms of the number of exabyte chips. So any kind of help with where you run into a wallet, you continue to grow there. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, I don't think we're going to make any comment on that. We are quite focused on ensuring we get the right, we have the supply, demand, balance and continuing to be very prudent and disciplined in our capital expenditure.
Operator: Thank you. [Indiscernible] comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, thank you gentlemen. The last quarter you launched the 32 terabyte SMR and 26 terabyte CMR with 11 disks. And I think you noted you would complete qualifications in coming quarters. I think you have that beginning to ship at two hyperscalers now and perhaps a third one is in the process of qualifying. So I was hoping you could discuss the order rates and visibility you see for these high capacity drives as we think about the sustainability and growth of the HDD business throughout 2025. Thank you.
Irving Tan: Hi, this is Irving. Thanks for the question. As mentioned, we see the outlook for nearline continuing to be healthy as you've alluded to. We expect the qualification for new 32 terabyte SMR and 24 terabytes CMR to be completed sometime in CQ1 of the calendar year. And I would say our customers are very excited about those drives and will provide you more visibility as we move forward.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Irving Tan: Thanks Karl.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Yes, thank you very much. One question we get. I understand the seasonality here in March and I understand a couple of quarter where there is some variability. But any visibility into the inventory levels here and then just at the hyperscalers how you guys are thinking about it and then just the supply chain on the HDD side. How are you thinking about the supply chain being able to meet the rising demand that you guys are thinking about? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, thanks for the question. Look, when we talk about Q3 and what we guided is very much necessarily indicate lower visibility or higher visibility. We think we have good visibility of what the inventory is doing in our customers and where the orders look for the next few quarters. It's just a matter of timing of orders. And so this is how sort of probably the best way to think of it. There isn't very much more than that going on at least as we see from where our customer’s inventories and orders look like. In terms of the supply chain. Look, we are operating in a tighter supply chain on the hard drive side. We've said that for the last couple of quarters. I think we have a great operations team that continues to be able to manage to deliver to our customers as many products as we can and we will continue to operate as such in the next few quarters. The fact that we moved to build to orders with many of our customers gives us great visibility or greater visibility than before and so that also helps in the ability to continue to deliver the products when required, when needed.
Asiya Merchant: Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuno. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. Just to follow up on the hard disk drive side, good numbers there. But I think as you move this capacity to create two terabyte disks, I think we were going up to 11. Do you see the need to kind of push on the areal density side too as your fear is moving on the hammer side? Any thoughts there and then a follow up.
David Goeckeler: Yes, thanks for the question. We always focus on improving aerial density and performance. That's something we also get a major lift from our Ultra SMR capability and we think that's a huge competitive advantage. And obviously Ultra SMR capability will be extensible even as we transition from our ePMR portfolio eventually to our [Indiscernible] portfolio as well.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the NAND side, I know you talked about gaining more CapEx guidance at the analyst day. Any thoughts on how you see the pricing margin kind of trend to the year? I know probably haven't talked about that in the past.
David Goeckeler: Yes, we don't talk too much about that. I mean I think what, I think I said I see going into next quarter, I see. We see some ASP headwinds but those moderating in intensity from what we saw this quarter. So that's, that's a good sign as we sit here today. And this is why we're taking the supply actions we're taking is to support pricing, to get, we're seeing some headwinds here. We still have some, we still have a lot of confidence in demand as we move throughout the year. But we'll make some, some adjustments here to make sure that we bring the market back into balance and an slightly undersupplied spot as quickly as possible to support pricing and margins in the business.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ananda Baruah. I'm sorry, with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, thanks guys for taking the question. I'll just keep it to one, but David would love to get your or any of your view on sort of Flash, the role of Flash in hyperscale storage. The area that's been sort of overwhelmingly represented by Neil and Jack. There's a pretty, it's a pretty big flash vendor, systems vendor that made it pretty public announcement in December about having a hyperscale win. And that's been a big topic of conversation over the last few months here in both businesses. So we'd just love to get your view on dynamics in that market. That's it for me, thanks.
David Goeckeler: All right. Yes, my position's been pretty stable here for quite some time. This is use case driven. There's always going to be use cases that use Flash. There's always going to be use cases that use hard drives. That mix has been relatively stable. Maybe it changes a little bit simply because Flash is growing faster and you tend to see newer use cases come for Flash. I think AI model training is a good one. That's very Flash driven type use case. However, once you start generating all that data, it's going to go back onto hard drives. And the hard drives have a very robust roadmap as Irving talked about. Very strong focus on aerial density. Continue to drive cost downs there. Tremendous innovations. The arbitrage on the cost there is going to stay the same for quite some time. But Flash is going to grow a little faster. Hard drives are going to grow. As they say, two things can be true. They're both true and we feel very strong about both of them. As far as hard drives in the cloud, I'll note that we just shipped nearly 161exabytes in a quarter into the cloud. So this is a very big at scale business. There's always going to be use cases where again, there's always going to be use cases in the hyperscale that come up that can be satisfied with Flash. We're very big fans of that. Right. We're very bullish on Flash as well. It doesn't mean it's at the expense of hard drives. It's just that's how we see the market. We've called that way for years and we continue to see that dynamic playing out. It's good for both businesses. I mean, look, take it up a level. We've got all this AI demand. There's been a lot of conversation about AI in the last several days. As a matter of fact, some major innovations in accelerating the adoption of AI. It's an area where there's an incredible amount of investment going which leads to amazing innovations. And as this market continues to accelerate, that's going to be great for both of these businesses. It's going to accelerate the creation of data. It increases the value of data to train more models, which increases the amount of data that gets stored. So this is going to drive hard drives dramatically as inference moves to the edge. Remember, we talk a lot about enterprise SSDs. It's a very important, very big market. But NAND is predominantly an edge business. And as inference moves to the edge, it's going to drive an enormous amount of NAND consumption there as well, both in unit growth capacity per unit. So we're very, very bullish on the storage market and we've seen some great dynamics here over the last year and we think this is going to continue for quite some time.
Ananda Baruah: Thank you for all of that. Really appreciate it.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Mark Miller at the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.
Mark Miller: Thank you for the question. I just was wondering, are you seeing across the board supply reductions by your NAND competitors and if so, any estimate on how much they're reducing?
David Goeckeler: I don't, I think, we don't, we don't really talk about what our competitors are doing. We're going to focus on talking about our business. I mean, we've been very clear about what we've been doing. We see this little pause in the market. We were very, very open about how we're going to manage the business going forward in this new era of NAND. We talked a lot about that, just about how the -- how expensive the nodal transitions are and how we have to be very disciplined on cap backs and we have to be very disciplined about how we supply the market, given just how big the market is now and how much productivity comes out of these nodal transitions. So that's the way we're managing the business. We continue to see good demand throughout this year. We continue to see a balanced, undersupplied market and we're going to take some actions just to make sure that's the case across our portfolio based on what we're seeing.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for closing remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you everybody for joining us. We look forward to seeing all of you in New York here in a couple weeks and talking about these two businesses we feel very good about. We've executed this separation over the last year, and we're right here on the doorstep of launching these as two separate companies. And we look forward to talking to all of you about that in great detail here in just another 10, 11 days. So we look forward to seeing you then. Thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for joining. You may now disclose your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-10-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2025 performance. Western Digital delivered revenue of $4.1 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of 38.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78. Our dedication to lasting quality and reliability through our industry-leading innovation and diversified portfolio have allowed us to proactively mix bits into the most profitable end markets, resulting in sequential revenue growth and margin improvement across both Flash and HDD. These growth opportunities are bolstered by the AI Data Cycle, substantially increasing the long-term need for storage across both our Flash and HDD markets. In Flash, the proactive measures we took during the downturn along with our disciplined capital investment strategy have significantly enhanced Western Digital's business agility and structural margin potential. Combined with our flexibility and bit allocation and continued progress in bringing highly compelling enterprise SSDs to market, we mitigated headwinds in certain core end markets, achieving sequential and year-over-year revenue growth and improving Flash gross margin beyond our through-cycle target. In HDD, the strength of our portfolio lies in our UltraSMR technology, which empowers us to deliver the industry's highest capacity hard drives while ensuring unmatched reliability, quality and performance. Western Digital has achieved record HDD gross margin and the highest revenue levels in 11 quarters, driven by the growing adoption of our UltraSMR drives to meet the demand for scalable and cost effective storage solutions. This technology is a key driver of our continued gross margin improvement with wide adoption of two cloud customers and a third expected to ramp shortly. We anticipate UltraSMR will continue to grow across the US and beyond, solidifying our leadership in the market over time. Now, I would like to provide an update on our business separation plans. We are on track with the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses. At the start of the fiscal second quarter, we completed our soft-spin phase. Through meticulous planning and project management, this massive initiative has been executed exceptionally well and the businesses have hit the ground running, thanks to the dedicated efforts of numerous teams over the past year. In the fiscal second quarter, we continue to execute our soft-spin stage and are working diligently on the critical work streams needed as we make significant progress on the regulatory filings required in connection with the spin. Financing activities are anticipated to start soon, which will set the stage for us to execute the separation, which we expect will occur once we close the second quarter. I'll now turn to business updates. Starting with Flash, revenue reached its highest level in nine quarters. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by continued recovery in data center fueled by strong demand for our enterprise SSD applications, which grew 76% sequentially, reaching the highest revenue level since fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The cloud tailwind in the quarter was offset by ongoing weakness in consumer and in client with PC OEMs working down inventory and pushing out the refresh purchase cycle. On the technology front, we made significant progress with several hyperscaler and storage OEM qualifications including developments with PCI Gen 5 data center enterprise SSD and our 30 and 60 terabyte high capacity offerings. In addition, we continue to enhance our premium SanDisk brand by delivering on our leadership blueprint and core devices roadmap, expanding our platform capabilities with product partnerships developing robustly. I'll now turn to our Flash outlook. As we look ahead to the fiscal second quarter, we expect the continued ramp of our new enterprise SSD offerings to supplement seasonal strength in our consumer end market. Within client, we expect PC OEM demand to stabilize while gaming declines as we have successfully met the demand for the holiday season. We anticipate a recovery in our consumer and client end markets as we move through calendar year 2025. Furthermore, we are seeing high demand for enterprise SSD product offering and anticipate it to serve as the primary driver for revenue growth for the full fiscal year, with qualifications doubling since the start of the fiscal fourth quarter 2024. We now expect our enterprise SSD mix to comprise over 15% of our overall portfolio bit shipments in fiscal year 2025 growing at a pace significantly faster than previously anticipated. Our overall view of the Flash market remains positive as we maintain supply and demand balance by remaining committed to disciplined capital spending and improving profitability through a proactive bit allocation across our most high value end markets increasing our exposure to enterprise SSDs. Turning to HDD, in the fiscal first quarter, we achieved record revenue in data center, reflecting the strength of our nearline portfolio and our ongoing efforts to capitalize on market tailwinds. We are operating in an environment where demand for our products exceeds supply. To address this, we are working with our customers to improve our visibility into their future needs with our largest customers on a two to six quarter agreement cycle, aligning seamlessly with our proactive supply management strategy that supports predictable business operations and sustainable profitable growth. This long-term visibility allows us to not only better serve our customers, but also mitigate volatility while structurally improving our through-cycle profitability. On the technology front, we see increasing adoption of our UltraSMR technology showcasing strong confidence in our products' capabilities and benefits. In the fiscal second quarter, we launched our 32 terabyte UltraSMR and 26 terabyte CMR drives, marking the world's first commercially available hard drives with 11 disks. Developed with our time tested and reliable ePMR and UltraSMR technologies, we expect these products to complete customer qualifications and ramp in the coming quarters, delivering a compelling TCO to our customers and improving portfolio profitability. Turning to the HDD outlook, as we head into the fiscal second quarter, we anticipate continued momentum in data center to drive growth across our nearline portfolio. Adoption of our UltraSMR product line is expanding, particularly among cloud customers. The HD business continues to undergo a positive structural transformation. Our thoughtful approach to commercializing our product line, especially our UltraSMR technologies has enabled us to drive record revenue in the midst of AI's emergence as another pivotal growth driver for the industry. And with improved visibility into future demand, a focus on operational excellence, efficient cost structure and a strong commitment to maintaining a balanced supply demand dynamic, we are well positioned to continue delivering the most profitable and innovative product portfolio while establishing long-term industry leadership through our earnings potential. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal first quarter results.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal first quarter, Western Digital delivered great results with gross margin and earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion up 9% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 54% of total revenue at $2.2 billion, up 17% sequentially and more than doubling year-over-year. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increases were driven by higher nearline shipments in HDD and enterprise SSD bit shipments to datacenter customers. Client represented 29% of total revenue at $1.2 billion flat sequentially, and up 5% year-over-year. Compared to last quarter, Flash bit shipment growth in gaming and mobile was offset by a decline in PC OEM, while HDD revenue was flat. Year-over-year, an increase in Flash revenue was primarily due to higher ASPs as bit shipments declined and was partially offset by lower HDD revenue. Consumer represented 17% of revenue at $0.7 billion flat sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, a slight growth in HDD offset a decline in Flash, driven by softer consumer demand. Year-over-year, the decrease was due to lower Flash and HDD bit shipments, partially offset by improved pricing in both Flash and HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal first quarter, Flash revenue was $1.9 billion, up 7% from last quarter and 21% year-over-year. Continued recovery in data center drove strong demand for enterprise SSD products. Sequentially, Flash ASPs increased 4% on a like for like basis and decreased 6% on a blended basis. Bit shipments were up 14% from the previous quarter and down 12% compared to last year. HDD revenue was $2.2 billion up 10% sequentially and 85% year-over-year. Sequentially, strong performance in the nearline portfolio led to a 14% increase in HDD exabyte shipments. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 107% and average price per unit increased 46% to $164. Nearline bit shipments were at a record level of 141 exabytes, up 12% from the previous quarter, and 157% compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Moving to the rest of the income statement, please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 38.5%, which was at the higher end of the guidance range. Gross margin increased 220 basis points sequentially due to improved mix, better pricing and continued focus on cost reduction. Flash gross margin was 38.9%, up 240 basis points sequentially driven by a higher mix of enterprise SSD bits, improvement in like-for-like pricing and continued cost reduction. In HDD, strong demand for nearline drives as well as efficient manufacturing operations and cost structure have driven continued margin expansion, resulting in gross margin of 38.1%, up 200 basis points sequentially. We have structurally changed the way we operate our businesses. Combined with our strong product portfolio, this has enabled us to generate gross margins above our long-term target ranges in both Flash and HDD. Operating expenses were down sequentially to $691 million including the synergies of $8 million. These results demonstrate continued focus on cost discipline, while making progress on the execution of the business separation plans. Operating income was $884 million, up 33% sequentially driven by better gross margins and disciplined spending. Operating margin was 21.6%, up 390 basis points sequentially, which is the highest in five years and was previously achieved at a higher revenue level. Income tax expense was $124 million and effective tax rate was 16.1%. Earnings per share was $1.78. Operating cash flow for the fiscal first quarter was $34 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $14 million. Operating and free cash flows included payments of $418 million for the company's repatriation tax installment along with IRS settlement payments. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a cash outflow of $48 million. Fiscal first quarter inventory increased sequentially to $3.4 billion with days of inventory declining by 5 days to 121 days. A decrease in HDD inventory was more than offset by an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.5 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were 1.7 billion and total liquidity was $3.9 billion including undrawn revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. After the close of fiscal first quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of 80% of equity interest in SanDisk Semiconductor Shanghai to JCET, thereby forming a joint venture between SanDisk China and JCET. Proceeds from the sale will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter's cash flow. I'll now turn to the fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance. We anticipate both Flash and HDD revenue to grow on a sequential basis. In Flash, we expect the ramp of enterprise SSD products and seasonality of consumer demand to drive bit shipment increases in the mid-single-digit percentage points. In HDD, we expect continued growth momentum in the nearline product portfolio. We anticipate revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $695 million to $715 million including the synergy costs of $25 million to $35 million as we continue to make progress executing on the business separation plans. Interest and other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $110 million. Tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 17%. We expect EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 based on approximately 357 million shares outstanding. As shown in our guidance, we remain committed to executing our business, driving higher profitability and cost discipline, while making great progress towards the completion of our business separation plans. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. Our results this quarter are a testament to our efforts to optimize our business for the long-term and execute on our strategic initiatives. We are confident in our product roadmap across both our Flash and HDD businesses and are excited by the significant opportunities ahead that each present, especially with the continued proliferation of the AI Data Cycle. As we continue to work towards the completion of our business separation plans, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value and deliver the most compelling and innovative products to our customers. Let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you raised your enterprise SSD as part of the mix to 15%, which I think is a pretty important inflection. So I was hoping you could speak to the qualifications that you've seen and in particular would love to hear more around the recently announced qualification with NVIDIA's GB200, NVL72 rack system. If there's any way to kind of quantify how to think about the ramp and magnitude of incremental dollars to your business would be great.
David Goeckeler: Hey, C.J., thanks for the question. Yeah, we feel really good about where the portfolio is. We've talked I think for a quarter or so now about this, our compute focused PCIe Gen 5 product that's what was qualified by NVIDIA in their reference architecture that allows us to go to all the folks that are building those products for customers and be in a good position to have those conversations as we drive that product more broadly in the market. We also have a very deep engagement with one, well, a couple of large hyperscalers on that product as well. So to your point, we've got more confidence in the growth of the portfolio. It's a very good demand environment. That's I don't think that's new news for enterprise SSDs and it's nice to have the portfolio where we can play into that. And as you said we expect our mix of bits when we add it all up the end of fiscal year last quarter when we were having this conversation we thought it would be around 10%. Now we're more in the 15% to 20% range. So demand keeps going up, the number of qualifications we've doubled in the last quarter. So the traction with the portfolio is good. It all aligns well with the AI Data Cycle we put out there both for the compute focused SSDs and then the high capacity data lake focused SSDs 30 and 60 terabytes. And again the traditional products that we were selling to the hyperscalers are also doing well also. So just I think that portfolio is something we've been working on for quite some time. As you know we got qualified before the downturn. We came out of it with a better portfolio. I think we really did a good job, teams did a great job throughout the downturn of staying focused on building those products and building a stronger portfolio and now we're seeing the results of that.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. And I guess as a quick follow-up, you talked around the ongoing transformation of the HDD industry and now two to six quarters of customer visibility. Would love to hear kind of how perhaps pricing negotiation is evolving and within that construct do you have visibility today for pricing beyond one quarter in the DRiV business? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Sure. I think as you said we've gotten to the point where I think we have a better supply demand balance in this industry for the first time. Well, let's just talk about our business and our business for a very, very long time based on the actions we took coming out of the downturn. That matched against a fantastic portfolio that continues to get traction. We talked a lot about it in the script. UltraSMR technology is really getting very good traction with customers that have adopted it -- adopt it at quite a bit of scale. I mean once you go through the work to implement that technology you get that additional 10% of capacity on every drive you deploy. So it gives customers a very good reason to keep deploying those drives and we just had the third hyperscaler and get the official qualification very recently and we expect them to ramp pretty quickly now over the next several quarters. So both of those things allow us to get more visibility into the business, more visibility, more predictability is always great on a business where you're vertically integrated. And it does give us also I've said it for many years now, pricing is all about TCO, it's about delivering a better product. We deliver a better product that drives the TCO down for our customers. We get to participate in that equation and monetize that R&D that we developed. And we just launched a 26 terabyte CMR, 32 terabyte UltraSMR drive. So we expect that to ramp as we go through 2025 and as we do that that will bring better pricing and margin dynamics to the business.
C.J. Muse: Thanks so much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I just want to make sure I understand the steps towards separating the companies. You talked about having kind of prepared the soft-spin. So you're going to report you'll have two separate sets of numbers for the December quarter. And assuming that goes well, you'll be able to file the Form-10 at some point during the March quarter. Is that the plan and kind of what are the anything that could cause that to come later?
David Goeckeler: Yes, let me walk through that, Joe, because it's a little different than you described. So we're in the soft-spin stage, which means we're still running the company as Western Digital, right. There's one company, but behind the scenes we've separated all the systems into basically two stacks of systems. So for example, if customers want to send us orders now, they have to send us two different orders for HDDs and Flash because they go into two different sets of systems. They have a different vendor ID for those, all of those kinds of issues. Our own teams as they go through the process to build those products, ship those products are logging into different systems to manage the flow of that business through the enterprise. Now so what we're doing is we're running Western Digital, we're doing this behind the scenes. That's called the soft spin. We're actually essentially doing both. And what we'll do is we will execute in this mode for a full quarter because we want to go through a full quarter of all the financial things we do on a monthly and quarterly basis to give ourselves confidence that both of those systems work great and then we'll go do the spin. So what we expect to do now is, we will execute the business in this form for the full second quarter. We will close the December quarter as Western Digital. We only issue one set of numbers for Western Digital. We only did one guide for Western Digital this time. But behind the scenes we're doing all that work to build confidence we could do it as two separate companies. Sometime in the next, I would say, a couple of months, we'll make -- we'll flip the Form 10 to public. We're going through the final phases of that with appropriate authorities. Once we get that done, we'll make it public so we can start financing activities for both businesses to basically get all the financing in place so that we -- once we close the books and we get confidence in that, then we could then move on with the actual distribution. So that's the way it will work. So cut through all that, we got a lot of work to do. It's on track. You should think about this happening around the time we would do an earnings call for the December quarter.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you so much for that. And I guess I get a lot of questions from more event-driven types of investors about the resolve to do this in the wake of things that are happening with our JV partner and things like that. So just maybe if you could just kind of state how focused you are on getting this done, any impediments? Any chance that this doesn't happen from out of your discretion?
David Goeckeler: We're very focused on getting this done, Joe. As you know, we went through a thorough strategic review that we announced the outcome of October 30th of last year and we started down this path. We knew it was a big thing to do. But we're not -- the results of the strategic review is this is the right answer for our shareholders. We're not trying to time the cycle or anything else. So we plan to move forward with this when we're ready. And it's all about building confidence in the ability to execute two independent companies, and that's what we're driving to. I can't predict everything that will happen in the future, but that's -- from our perspective, we're driving to get this done as expeditiously as we can.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I have two, if I may. First off, how much room do you have in your existing facilities to expand capacity of heads and media for hard disk drives? I asked because you just reported record exabytes and hard drives, it was about 180. And as you address that question, you spoke of a third hyperscaler that is qualified SMR, Dave, and you will ramp in the coming quarters. Is that for your 32 TB offering or is that just a broad statement? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: I think as a general without getting into specifics on any particular costs, I think, in general, most customers want to go with the most dense drive they can once they start deploying. So we expect that customers will move to the 32 terabyte drive pretty quickly. Again, I think this is, the product strategy, I think is really playing out well here. These drives can be qualified very quickly. Customers understand the technology. It's been in their environment for quite some time. So I'm talking about the base ePMR technology and the base architecture we have in these drives and now we can move capacity up quickly. So in general, customers want to deploy the densest drive possible. So we expect the 32s once they get through qualifications, we'll start being deployed, let's say, as we move through '25. On your first question on capacity for heads and media, I mean, we don't really talk about what our capacity is. We sized our infrastructure for a number of units that we think is going to satisfy the market and then we're going to increase exabytes by continuing to drive innovation and more density per unit. You're seeing that happen in real time as we just launched a new drive. And we've got the capacity all the way through heads and media and test capacity and assembly to support that level of capacity. And that was really a big move in the downturn to get it right. And so that we can get our -- make sure we keep our costs under control. And then, Karl, the real focus is to get more visibility from our customers and what their plans are and planning so that we can make sure we've got that capacity aligned with what demand is and try and dampen some of the volatility of the typical we typically talk, or maybe not anymore, hopefully not any more talk about big ingestion cycles, then big digestion cycles. We want a more predictable business in that. So we want to -- that -- the key to that is visibility into customer demand.
Karl Ackerman: Very clear. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Karl.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll stick to two as well. I guess the first question is going back to kind of operating the two entities separately now starting in this October period. Can you just remind us again of how we should think about dissynergies? What maybe factored into your December quarter guide as clearly you're carrying two company cost structures? And then as kind of a follow-up to Karl's question, you are shipping nearline capacity 25% above your prior peak levels, if my math is close to being right. How much does it -- how quickly can you bring on new capacity? And is there any way to frame like I could appreciate technology and aerial density expansion is a key driver. But do you see a situation where you will be constrained over the foreseeable next couple of quarters or just I'd love to dig a little bit deeper into Karl's question there?
Wissam Jabre: So let me start with the first part of the question, Aaron. I think your question was on dissynergies. So in the first quarter that we announced, we had approximately $8 million of dissynergies in the operating expenses. And the guide there is 25% to 35% roughly, sorry, this is -- I take that back. There is $25 million to $35 million, not percent of OpEx assumed in the OpEx in the current guide. In other words, the 705 midpoint of OpEx includes approximately, let's say, midpoint $30 million. Basically, as we said last time, dissynergies are assumed to be roughly split 50-50 between the two operating businesses. And so this is what's in the guide. In terms of where we would be at the steady state, I would say, at this point, it hasn't changed from what we discussed last quarter. And the steady state anticipate to be roughly in the, let's say, $40 million range divided equally by each of the businesses. So that's how we should think of it beyond this quarter. But for this quarter, it's around $30 million plus or minus $5 million. Maybe for the second part of your question, I don't know, David. Maybe I'll start making some comments and I'll ask David to chime in. With respect to the manufacturing capacity, our focus in the hard drive business, as we've said all along, is really on driving profitability and maintaining that supply-demand balance for our business. And so as we -- from where we stand now we think we have -- with the good visibility that we're getting from our customers and the implementation of build-to-order. We think we're in a good place from a capacity or from a manufacturing capacity perspective and we don't see the need for us to expand our manufacturing capacity footprint. I don't know, David, if you had a few things to add.
David Goeckeler: I think that's right, Aaron. I mean, look, I mean at least the way I think about this capacity if you look at the units we've shipped in the last two or three quarters, it's all converged pretty closely. So there's not a lot of variability in that number. It goes up and down some like less than a million units. But for an industry that shipped hundreds and hundreds of millions of units, not that long ago, that's a pretty tight window. I think the way we're thinking about this is what's demand going to be a year from now? It takes a year to build a hard drive once we start a wafer, no matter what our wafer capacity is for heads. Once we start a wafer, it's going to be a year before that shows up in a hard drive. So what we really are working to understand is what demand is going to be a year from now and how our customers are thinking about that and that's something new for them, right? And we're working through that process with them. And everything is going in the right direction. We talked about we have between two and six quarters of visibility, as we continue to get more visibility and develop conviction about what demand is going to look like over the next year plus then we'll start looking at the capacity question and if it's different than what we planned, we'll think about capacity at that point. But we -- there's still more work to do to understand what capacity is going to look like in that kind of timeframe before we start adding that cost back into the system. We don't want to, I talked about in the script, better through-cycle dynamics. We don't want underutilization charges. We want more predictable flow of business and our supply chain wants that too. So that's just a little bit on how I'm thinking about it.
Aaron Rakers: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.
David Goeckeler: Thanks.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Can you just talk about bookings on the HDD side? I mean they see pricing going higher. They see you and Seagate talking about not adding capacity. So why would they not just place shadow orders to make sure they get what they need a year from now? I mean that's often how it works in memory. I certainly understand that the cycle times here are much, much longer. But can you talk about that? And sort of what is this two to six quarter agreement cycle mean? Are these take-or-pay so that they can't just place shadow orders that they'd be on the hook to take the stuff when you build it? Can you talk about all that? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Tim, I would say, the industry is evolving, right? This is something new. I mean this is an industry that wasn't that long ago while the business transacted every quarter. So we're asking customers more visibility understanding what their demand is. They haven't particularly thought about this franchise that way and getting that much visibility into it. So and they're big relationships, especially with the big hyperscalers like very, very big relationships. Nobody wants to yank each other around unnecessarily. So I think it's in all of our best interest to have as much visibility as possible so that we can supply the market. We don't want to short the market, but we also don't want to basically build capacity that we don't have visibility into how it's going to be used. So at this point, it's not a take-or-pay. It's just about getting visibility into kind of how they're thinking about their infrastructure and what their demand is going to be. So we know how much supply we're going to have the ability to produce from a unit perspective that we get that aligned with their demand. And I would say we're working through that process right now. And I mean, clearly, the more visibility people our customers and partners can give us then we can allocate that future supply to them. And it's just kind of the process we're going through right now. So it's -- we're kind of walking into this and changing the industry, we think, in a very positive way for everybody involved.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Your guidance suggests a slight tick down in gross margins at the midpoint sequentially. Can you just help us think through the drivers of that? And you obviously launched your 11 platter mass capacity drive too. How should we think of margins of that scale higher as you go through the course of fiscal '25? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. So you got it right, Wamsi, that as we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to drive margin higher. We just launched a new product. It will just start qualification, so it's not going to start deployment for another couple of quarters. So in the HDD business, we're going to see margins basically flat Q-to-Q. Flash, we'll see a little bit down driven by some the cost in the next quarter are a little bit up from what they usually would be probably what you guys model on a 15% down year-over-year. We're going to get a quarter. We have a little cost increase just given the way the expenses are flowing. So I think that should help you understand the way the margins are going to work.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So on enterprise SSD, it's taken a while, but now there's clarity on the really strong tie in, right, to these AI and accelerated compute clusters. I think you gave us your view on bit mix. But I think according to my calculations, I think June quarter, I think, enterprise SSD was about 7%, 8% of your total Flash revs. It looks like in the September quarter, it stepped up to about 12%, 13% of your Flash revenues. Is that about right? And then on some of the recent specs on your high-capacity 64 terabyte, 128-terabyte platforms targeted for AI. Looks like the team has really set up their competitiveness here. Like what have been the biggest drivers of that better performance? Is it controller technology? Is it firmware? Is it reliability quality metrics? Like any color here would be great. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Let me start with the first part of the question, Harlan. With respect to where we are from an enterprise SSD as a mix, we're basically with in the Q1, we've exceeded a little bit the 15% of that mix. And as David mentioned in his comments a bit earlier that we would expect for the year, the mix of enterprise SSD as a percent of total for the Flash business to be between 15% and 20%.
David Goeckeler: So, Harlan, on the competitive part, I mean, you kind of -- you got it, right? I mean it's about getting the controller technology right. And we -- as I said during the downturn, we stayed very focused on that. We've got the right controllers built. We've always had great underlying NAND technology. The BiCS road map is something we've talked about a lot. And we feel good about that now. And going forward, we still got all the BiCS8 in front of us and that 2 terabit die. That helps build higher-density enterprise SSDs as well because the lower number of die to get the density. We're not quite there yet, but we have that in our future. So it's about getting it all of it aligned. And we stayed very focused over the last two, three years since I got here. This was a big focus of, again, going back to how we structured the company into kind of a business unit model, bringing in a general manager that can stay very focused on what should be built, stay on top of all the programs and make sure we deliver the right products that drive the make the highest ROI investments and then make sure those products. Those projects deliver the right products to market. And I think we feel good about where we're at. We're hitting this AI Data Cycle with the right -- it's the right time for the portfolio to emerge. We still got some more work to do, but we feel good about where we're at and the trajectory.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And Dave thanks for the color. When I look at December quarter, you said Flash revenue should grow, while bit shipment should be up mid-single-digits. So what does it mean for ASPs? The reason I'm asking is that while eSSD is strong, you keep hearing the non- eSSD data points are not good. So that's why I'm wondering how to think about ASP. And if I may extrapolate, how do you think about March quarter for both Flash and Hard Drives, given there is some seasonality aspect for both those segments in March? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Chris, so you got, I mean, again I think you've got it in the way you framed your question. The Flash market is a big market. There's a lot of submarkets inside of it. The PC market is some inventory there and those customers restocked and have not replenished inventory. They're just building to demand at this point, same with smartphone, the consumer business has just been a little bit soft. So you've got kind of that dynamic. And then on the other side of it, you've got very, very strong enterprise SSD. Now we expect, as we go through '25, we expect those smartphone and PC markets to recover as we go throughout the year and be stronger. We can talk about that in more detail. But I think that's a well-understood topic. And we expect enterprise SSD to stay very strong. But when you look at it on a sequential basis, you're looking at basically flat blended pricing and a little bit of cost headwind which is where you get a little bit of sequential decline in margins. Going it's a little early to talk about the March quarter. But again you got it right on seasonality there. There might be some seasonality hit. I would expect some seasonality headwinds going into the March quarter. But we'll have more to say about that as we move through the quarter and especially get to this time next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, David, if I just go back to this 100, the exabyte shipment of 163 on the HDD side. How do you get confidence that this is not sitting in inventory versus actually getting deployed by your customers? Is there any metrics in the UC internally that gives you confidence that this is actually getting used up and not piling up as inventory potentially. Anything on that front would be really helpful to understand. And then Wissam, you just touch on your CapEx expectations for HDD and the Flash business for the rest of the year, that would be helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We don't see a lot of inventory at the big players, right? We're coming off of -- we're still like in a cyclical recovery from the very deep downturn we're coming out of. And we're very, very close to these customers, given the size of the relationship. So we don't think that there is inventory -- excessive inventory being built here or double ordering or any of that happening. We think everybody is just trying to figure out what their future demand is so we can make sure we do the best we can to meet it and they give us the best -- the highest integrity signal possible on what that demand is.
Wissam Jabre: And with respect to the CapEx, Amit, what we started doing last quarter is, we're talking about CapEx for the quarter. So for this quarter, I expect our gross CapEx to be more or less in line with the last few quarters, the average over the last few quarters. So there's no real inflection.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thomas O'Malley: Hey, Dave, Wissam. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask for you to help quantify the benefit on the eSSD side versus the traditional NAND portfolio. Obviously, you're saying that grows from 15% today to 15% to 20%. So nice tailwind throughout the year. But just on a like-for-like basis, could you just try to help describe what that tailwind means? Obviously, you're not going to give an exact pricing away, but just give us a flavor for how beneficial that is for the business. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. It's accretive to the portfolio. Let's put it that way. And that's a good starting point. You probably knew that. It tends to be one of the better if not the best price markets in the Flash business. So it provides a nice tailwind to the portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Yes. Thank you. David just to follow-up to the previous question. I'm looking at your Flash ASPs being down 6% on a blended basis. But on a like-for-like basis, it's only down 4%. So it seems somewhat counterintuitive because your eSSD mix is growing, but the blended ASP is actually worse than like-for-like. So just trying to understand those dynamics as to why that's the case. And as I guess eSSD grows, how should we think about the blended ASP going forward? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. So I think it's even a little different than what you said. I think you said down 4% on like-for-like. Like-for-like was up for blended, it was down 6%. So it's all mix related. I think we said going into this quarter, we were mixing more into mobile. Clearly, as we mix in more enterprise SSD that helps, but that's an emerging story and an ascendant story for us. And so that's why you see that dynamic there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Loop Capital. I apologize. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Sorry about that. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the question.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Ananda.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, Dave. Yes, I was just -- could you -- actually what I wanted to ask is can you refresh our memory on what your conventional technology aerial density road map looks like kind of up until HAMR. I know you've talked about HAMR loosely kind of like next few years. But how should we think about the conventional tech aerial density road map up until then? That would be helpful. Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: Well, that's a very interesting area to explore. One thing is as it changes over time as you keep getting better. And I think a good example of that is we just introduced an 11 platter drive, I think for a long time, people thought 10 was probably the limit given the form factor, but advances in material science and things like that allow us to build thinner platters. And we can put in 11th in and there you go, you get 10% more just by doing that. So it's always an evolving story. But we clearly see the ability to drive our current platform, the 40 terabytes to make that bridge from 30 to 40. We're driving through that now. And that's where we expect HAMR to be introduced to carry the portfolio from there. So we've still got a generation or so here to go. We just announced one generation that just came into the market this quarter. Customers are excited about it. They're have it in their labs. They're trying to get it qualified. They want to get it deployed. I'm not going to announce a new product here right now, but you can assume there's going to be another generation after that. So we've got quite a bit of runway here on the portfolio. And those drives are drives that customers really understand, they're in their infrastructure now. They're -- it's a straightforward qualification process. They understand the performance, they understand the reliability, the quality of those drives. So really feel good about the technology decisions we've made to kind of fuel this market and now we have kind of these AI tailwinds behind it. And I think the portfolio is just extraordinarily well positioned to continue to drive growth in the business and continue to drive increased profitability.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking the call taking the question. So just in terms of HDDs, I understand that the strength here, continued strength here in the December quarter, we typically see some seasonality on the Flash side in the March quarter, just given the strength you're seeing on the HDD side, should we expect some seasonality here in the March quarter on the HDD side as well both in terms of bit shipments and then also on the ASP side. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean it's a little early for March, but I don't think that's a bad assumption to make at this point from where we are to see that on the HDD side as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color into the manufacturing efficiencies you think you get on a regular basis out of the HDD business. I would imagine there's debottlenecking still going on. And also as mix changes, it helps the utilization on the heads and platters. So I don't know if there's any Rule of Thumb we can think about or just maybe a little more color on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: I mean the way to think of it is we typically have obviously many programs in terms of cost reductions, which would drive manufacturing efficiency as well as things like improving yields, et cetera, at various parts of the supply of our manufacturing sort of process. The typical, I mean, I don't know if there's a typical, but the way to think of it is we will still be getting in the cost improvements and the probably mid to high single-digit percentage on an annual basis. That will be probably a fair assumption. But of course it varies of course with respect to how we move from one capacity point to another as well. So it's not like a linear thing.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Thanks. Just a quick question on the UltraSMR 32-terabyte. Are you -- with the 11 disks, are we able to still make it accretive on the margin side to your current portfolio? And also on the Flash side, just wondering what the CapEx looks like for next year. This year, I think, you had like a 0.8 fairly low cash outlay on the CapEx side, but just wondering how it looks next year. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean the 32-terabyte UltraSMR drive is a perfect example of us delivering a drive to our customers. It drives our TCO down. So as we drive their TCO down, it will drive our profitability up. And so we're very anxious to get that drive deployed just like our customers are and we expect that will provide some profitability tailwinds to the business.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. And with respect to the Flash CapEx, as I mentioned earlier, we're not providing sort of a longer-term view in terms of quantitatively, but what I would say is we're continuing to be focused on the profitability of the business. And so our focus is really to drive cost down. But when you look at CapEx, last fiscal year, our CapEx was very, very low. So we'd expect it to be a little bit higher from there.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Matt Bryson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bryson: Thanks for taking my question. What I was wondering is your hard drive pricing was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. I would have thought with the greater shipments into the cloud as well as the mix up towards high capacity drives, you would have seen a little bit of a benefit there. And then just one more point. I know you've talked about there being production constraints. One of the things that I've heard as being a constraining factor is test, paradigm telling us that they're not seeing any test orders. Should we take that as a sign that the hard drive industry is adding in a more rational fashion than in the past? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, look, on the second part of the question, I think we've just been pretty clear. We've kind of set our manufacturing capacity for a certain number of units. We think that unit times what our product road map is going to satisfy the exabyte growth in the industry and we're good with where we're at. And again if we get strong enough signals from our customers, that four to six quarter time frame, then we'll -- we can start talking about what that means for our production capacity, but we got a ways to go before we get something like that. On pricing, we did see a little bit of like-for-like pricing increase, very low-single-digits this quarter. It was a good quarter for margin improvement again in HDD, 38.1%, another record. I think we've added over 15 points of margin in the last four quarters. So it's been a good run. We'll take a little breather here maybe for a quarter. And then as new products get deployed, we'll see more tailwinds behind that. So we just feel like this business is in a great spot. And quite frankly that's because our technology is in a spot and it's really being adopted strongly by our customers. They're very much voting with their dollars behind the architecture that we're driving. And then during the downturn, the teams just did an awesome job of really getting our costs in the right spot to support this business and get supply-demand balance. So we feel good about the business and we look forward to driving it forward over the next several years.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Thanks for joining today. I really appreciate the interest in the business and all the great questions and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-07-31 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered strong results with fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $3.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 36.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44. For the fiscal year 2024, revenue totaled $13 billion. We have maintained our strategic focus on aligning our portfolio of industry-leading products with growth opportunities across a broad range of end markets to mitigate volatility while structurally improving our through-cycle profitability for both Flash and HDD. Before we discuss our performance, I want to provide our views on where the storage market is heading and how we are well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Our diverse portfolio, coupled with the structural changes we have made to strengthen our operations, is enabling us to benefit from the broad recovery we are beginning to see across our end markets. In addition, the AI Data Cycle is increasing the need for storage and creating new demand drivers across both Flash and HDD. These AI systems process and analyze existing data, generate new data and require substantial storage for training, operating in a continuous cycle of increasing data consumption, processing and generation. As AI technologies advance, data storage systems must deliver the capacity and performance necessary to support the computational demands of large sophisticated models while managing vast volumes of data. Given this landscape, we expect Flash to benefit from both AI training and inference while HDD is poised to benefit at both the input and output stages of these AI models. To address the growing performance, power and capacity requirements, we have developed our Flash and HDD product road maps to meet our end customer storage needs across the entire AI Data Cycle. We introduced the industry-leading high-performance PCIe Gen 5 SSD to support AI training and inference. A high-capacity 64 terabyte SSD for optimizing the build-out of rapid AI data lakes in the world's highest capacity ePMR UltraSMR 32-terabyte hard drive for cost effective and deep content storage at scale. These new offerings demonstrate our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. As we enter fiscal year 2025, we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities in data storage and believe the AI Data Cycle will be a significant incremental growth driver for the storage industry. Before I dive further into business updates, I want to update you on our separation plans. I am pleased with the progress our team has made as we continue to drive to completing the work required to separate the company at the end of the calendar year. As part of the ongoing preparation for the separation, we anticipate beginning to incur separation dis-synergy costs in the second half of the calendar year. Wissam will briefly discuss the anticipated impact of these costs. I'll now turn to business updates. Starting with Flash, the growth in revenue was driven by the recovery in cloud and a shift of our client mix to gaming and mobile, partially offset by a decline in consumer. Our focus on driving higher through-cycle profitability is reflected in our results as we proactively mix bits across our end markets. Our innovative offerings remain at the forefront of the market, reinforcing our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. For example, our new QLC-based client SSDs which grew 50% on a sequential exabyte basis, offer significantly better performance than our previous generation TLC products. Combining this high-performance node with our in-house controller development, enable us to provide a portfolio of client SSDs that deliver unmatched performance and value. We believe these products will lead the industry's transition to QLC flash. During our New Era of NAND webinar last month, we introduced the world's highest capacity BiCS8 2-terabyte QLC memory die, specifically designed to meet growing data center and AI storage needs. Built on a chip bonded to array architecture, BiCS8 reinforces Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost and capital efficiency as well as superior I/O performance by integrating wafer bonding in advanced 3D manufacturing to establish a ground-breaking foundation for future scalability of 3D NAND. In addition, our 64 terabyte enterprise SSD is now being sampled with plans for volume shipment later this calendar year. Furthermore, our PCIe Gen 5 based enterprise SSD delivers best-in-class read performance as well as power efficiency. We are seeing significant interest in this product which is currently qualifying at a hyperscaler with ramp expected in the second half of this calendar year. We'll talk more about our Flash road map at the upcoming Flash Memory Summit in early August. Turning to the Flash outlook. Throughout the fourth quarter, our product mix was dynamic as we proactively mix bits between our end markets in response to the softness we are seeing in the more transactional markets such as consumer and channel. Our success in identifying the most profitable approach to allocating bits is reflected in the growth of both our revenue and gross margin. As we look into the first quarter, in addition to the mix environment we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect the continued ramp of our new enterprise SSD offerings and seasonal strength in mobile to drive mid- to high-teens bit growth on a sequential basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect enterprise SSDs to represent a double-digit percent share in our portfolio mix. The new era of NAND is driving a period of change and we are going to remain disciplined in managing our capital spending. The layers focus race is behind us. The emphasis is now shifting towards strategically timing the economic introduction of new longer-lasting nodes. Innovation now means enhancing power efficiency, performance and capacity within these nodes, while capital decisions increasingly prioritize opportunities for margin expansion and revenue growth. Turning to HDD; revenue growth was driven by strength in nearline demand and improved pricing. By leveraging our SMR leadership and lean cost structure, we have surpassed our target gross margin range, underscoring our ongoing commitment to improve future profitability. The HDD business has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent quarters, marked by strategic initiatives aimed at introducing the most innovative, high-capacity products to market. We have increased our profitability meaningfully by restructuring our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our cost structure to drive operational efficiency. All while qualifying and ramping our SMR technology. We continue to structurally change the way we are operating our HDD business. With better visibility into future demand, operational excellence and a commitment to sustaining supply-demand balance, we are poised to continue our trajectory of bringing highly innovative products to market while increasing profitability into the future. On the technology front, we ship samples of our 32-terabyte UltraSMR/ePMR nearline hard drives to select customers. These drives feature advanced triple-stage actuators and OptiNAND technology which are designed for seamless qualification, integration and deployment in hyperscale cloud and enterprise data centers while maintaining exceptional reliability. With this in mind, we are well positioned to deliver the industry's highest capacity hard drives and the best TCO. Turning to the HDD outlook. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect further growth driven by greater demand and more favorable pricing. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR and we anticipate a third major cloud vendor to begin the ramp of adopting SMR in the fiscal first quarter. Our leading products and lean cost structure have supported ongoing profitability improvements in our HDD business. We remain focused on driving higher margins to reflect the significant innovation and TCO improvements we deliver to our customers. Our strategic approach to commercializing ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies has proven to be the winning strategy, enabling us to surpass our gross margin target for HDDs in the midst of AI's emergence as another pivotal growth driver for the industry. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, David. And good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Western Digital delivered great results with gross margin and earnings per share exceeding the high end of the guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 9% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.44. Looking at end markets, Cloud represented 50% of total revenue at $1.9 billion. The sequential growth of 21% is attributed to higher nearline shipments and pricing in HDD, coupled with increased bit shipments and pricing in enterprise SSD. The 89% year-over-year increase was due to higher shipments and price per unit in nearline HDDs along with higher enterprise SSD bit shipments. Nearline bit shipments were at a record level of 125 exabytes, up 16% from the previous quarter and 113% compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Client represented 32% of total revenue at $1.2 billion. The sequential increase of 3% was due to the increase in flash ASPs, offsetting a decline in flash bit shipments while HDD revenue decreased slightly. The 16% year-over-year growth was driven by higher flash ASPs. Consumer represented 18% of total revenue at $0.7 billion. Sequentially, the 7% decrease was due to lower flash and HDD bit shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs in both flash and HDD. The 5% year-over-year increase was driven by improved flash ASPs and bit shipments. For fiscal year 2024, revenue was $13 billion, up 6% from fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 22.8% and non-GAAP operating margin increased 8.7 percentage points to 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.20. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2024, Cloud revenue increased 2% year-over-year due to higher demand for capacity enterprise HDDs and improved pricing. For the year, client and consumer revenue grew by 7% and 9%, respectively, due to higher flash bit shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Compared to last year -- last quarter, Flash ASPs were up 14% on a blended basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 7% sequentially and 3% compared to last year as we proactively mixed Flash bits to maximize profitability. HDD revenue was $2 billion, up 14% from last quarter as exabyte shipments increased 12% and average price per unit increased 12% to $163. Compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 55%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 72% and 64%, respectively. Moving to the rest of the income statement. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Our focus on improving through-cycle profitability in both Flash and HDD has shown great progress. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin reached 36.3% well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved by 7 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing and cost reduction as well as higher volume. Within Flash, by proactively allocating bits between end markets and executing on our cost reduction initiatives, we have improved gross margin for 4 consecutive quarters. Flash gross margin was 36.5%, up 9.1 percentage points compared to last quarter and 48.4 percentage points year-over-year. In HDD, by offering a leading product portfolio and running efficient manufacturing operations focused on cost discipline, we continue to make progress in improving profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 36.1%, exceeding the long-term target range, up 5 percentage points sequentially and 15.4 percentage points compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Operating expenses were $700 million for the quarter, above our guided range, primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected profitability. Operating income was $666 million, tax expense was $17 million, earnings per share was $1.44. Operating cash flow was $366 million and free cash flow was $282 million. Cash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. For fiscal year 2024, cash capital expenditures were $244 million or 1.9% of revenue, excluding the proceeds from the sale leaseback of our Milpitas facility. Year-over-year, this represented a 69% decline. Fourth quarter inventory was up from the prior quarter at $3.3 billion. With days of inventory increasing from 119 days to 126 days. A decline in HDD inventory was more than offset by an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.5 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion and total liquidity was $4.1 billion including undrawn revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. I'll now turn to the fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance. We anticipate both Flash and HDD revenue and gross margin to improve on a sequential basis as we continue to drive improvements in profitability across our businesses. We anticipate revenue to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $695 million to $715 million. A decrease in variable compensation will be offset by the synergy costs as we continue to make progress executing on the separation plans. Included in this range are dis-synergy costs of $15 million to $25 million. We expect the synergy costs in the fiscal second quarter to be between $35 million and $45 million. Interest and expenses are anticipated to be approximately $110 million. Tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 17%. We expect earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.85 based on approximately 360 million shares outstanding. As shown in our guidance, we remain committed to driving higher profitability while maintaining focus on cost and capital discipline. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Today's results and guidance underscore Western Digital's strong execution with promising growth opportunities ahead. We delivered solid results as we doubled down on our strategic initiatives and product road map, capitalizing on robust growth prospects for both Flash and HDD. The emergence of the AI Data Cycle marks an incredibly exciting transformation in our industry, driving fundamental shifts across our end markets. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25 we are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions to spearhead innovative technologies and deliver unparalleled value for our customers. Peter, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.
C.J. Muse: I guess I would like to focus my question around HDD gross margins, truly impressive outlook in the actual results. I was hoping you could speak to your contracted supply today, your pricing visibility into the second half of the calendar year and whether that extends into calendar '25. And as part of that, how we should think about the progression of HDD gross margins as we go into September, December and beyond.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Sure. Thanks, C.J. So yes, we were very happy with where the HDD business is at. We've -- we spent a long time focused on getting our manufacturing footprint in the right spot and a lot of cost optimization there now that the volume ramps back, it puts us in a strong position plus the products, right? The continued strong adoption of UltraSMR, those drives are great for us. They're great for our customers. They're leading capacity points. So when you put it all together, we were able to deliver past our gross margin target in that business. Some of the historians around here tell me it's like the best gross margin ever. And the good news, as you said, is it's going higher. So we got good supply-demand balance that's giving us good visibility throughout the rest of the calendar year, we're -- we pretty much know where every drive is going to go. At this point, we made, I think, a really significant transition this past quarter and that we moved up our request to our customers to give us visibility 52 weeks ahead, so a 52-week lead time on HDDs. Now the reason that's so important is the cycle time underneath to build an HDD is about 50 weeks. So we've been working very hard to drive the technology, drive our manufacturing but also change the business practices of this business to give us the visibility that allows us to really align our investment with our customer demand. Our customers have responded well to that request and we now have visibility for the entire fiscal year from a number of our biggest customers. Others are still -- we're still working through it with them. But to wrap it all up, we're -- we're very happy with where the margins are. We continue to see margins going higher in this business as we continue to innovate. If we continue to innovate, deliver better TCO to our customers, we're going to continue to drive margins higher and we've got a very robust road map to do that. And we're now getting the visibility in place to -- in the business practices to make sure we can keep supply and demand balance going far into the future. So hopefully, that addresses your question.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: I wanted to ask about NAND and this kind of -- you have weaker volume in Q2 but good pricing. And we're seeing that everywhere that the volumes are sort of disappointing but the pricing has still been good. And usually, you sort of think about needing good demand for pricing to go up. So can you just talk about that dynamic? And what do you think happens over the back half of the year with supply and demand for NAND.
David Goeckeler: As you know, Joe, it's a very dynamic market. So we're still seeing -- in the negotiated markets, we're still seeing good pricing increases, especially enterprise SSD and that's something we're very excited about. We see -- we saw really good sequential growth in enterprise SSD and we're expecting very good sequential growth in the next quarter. Some of the more transactional markets where you have more players involved and frankly, some players that don't produce their own raw NAND, pricing is a little more dynamic and demand in general in consumer is a little bit weak. So in those markets, we see a little more demand headwind, a little more -- not quite as aggressive as pricing moves but in the negotiated markets, we still see good pricing. And then, you put mix all on top of that to come up with a quarter-by-quarter number where you got quite a bit of variability. But as we go through the back half of the year, we continue to see strong demand in Enterprise SSD. We see the PC market really kind of maybe a little bit of an inventory rebalancing here going on in the next quarter but we see that improving as we go throughout the year. I think that's a normal process given a couple of really strong quarters here in the first part of the recovery of NAND pricing. So we still see demand outstripping supply through the second half of the year. And quite frankly, our modeling shows throughout next calendar year as well.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS.
Grant Joslin: This is Grant Joslin on for Tim Arcuri. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you view the balance sheet and how you want to prioritize the free cash flow generated between now and the separation? And any updated thoughts on the appropriate leverage for each of the 2 segments?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, sure. As I noted in the prepared remarks, in Q4, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. And so as we generate cash, our focus is to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. The -- with respect to the second part of the question related to question related to the capital structure. Obviously, we're making good progress as we prepare for the separation, we will be as -- we get closer to the time of the separation, will be hosting Capital Market Days or Investor Days to discuss that in more detail. But as we've always said, our aim is to create 2 world-class companies that are competitive in their own spaces. And so their cap structures would be reflecting their -- the profile from a profitability, cash generation and market dynamics as well.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. One clarification I just want to throw out there. Is the dis-synergy costs all in operating expenses? Or is there anything in COGS? And then from a question perspective. When I look at the NAND business and I think you guys talked about in the prepared remarks of growing kind of mid- to high teens sequentially on a capacity ship basis this next quarter. I guess where my math leads me is to think that your underlying assumption would be maybe more of a flattish ASP trend in the September quarter. I guess my question is, is that kind of how you're thinking about that? And if so, why would we think that pricing would be flattish? Is there a mix dynamic, something that we should consider in that?
David Goeckeler: I'll take the second part of the question. Kind of remember the first part now.
Wissam Jabre: Let me take the first part related to the dis-synergy costs. The question was whether they were split -- they were all in operating expenses or there's anything in COGS. So Aaron, the numbers that I quoted, the $15 million to $25 million are all in operating expenses. There will be some dis-synergy costs in the COGS but they're really not material. And so that's why we didn't call them out. And they're reflected also in our guidance for Q1.
David Goeckeler: Yes. And Aaron, on the NAND pricing, I think you kind of answered your question as you went through there, just to confirm it. There's a huge mix dynamic. So we've got -- like everybody else, we're seeing some weakness in the consumer. And so that's -- consumer is 1/3 of our Flash portfolio. So that's a big business and that has very we've always talked about higher than average through-cycle margins. So that's a bit of a headwind. And then we -- it's a seasonally strong quarter for mobile. So that's -- there's a big mix dynamic there as well. So that -- but you're thinking about it the right way.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.
Karl Ackerman: One clarification question and a question, if I may. For my clarification question, is the PCIe Gen 5 Enterprise SSD at a hyperscaler separate or in addition to your sampling of 64 terabyte SSDs in the second half of this calendar year? I guess as you address that question, could you speak to the breadth of customer design wins you have on enterprise SSDs which are indicative of your growing share of SSD relative to your overall portfolio mix.
David Goeckeler: Yes. They are 2 separate products targeted to different parts of the AI Data Cycle. So the compute product that you mentioned, what we call a compute product because it's designed to feed data into GPUs and keep the pipeline full. So very high performance, very high-performance NAND. That product is a qualification in a hyperscaler and we're getting a lot of interest in that product across the AI ecosystem of anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure because we believe that product is the best read performance and really good power efficiency and that's what everybody is looking for in that market. The 64 terabyte drive is a separate product that's targeted at building these high-performance data lakes for AI training and we're looking at that across the kind of same sort of customers. Anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure is looking for those kind of products. And that's in addition to the products we had qualified enterprise SSD, we had qualified 2 or 3 of the hyperscalers before the downturn and those products are picking back up now as well. So we have a much -- we were -- we were happy with the portfolio and now we keep adding to it. And those products are really well targeted to where the demand is in enterprise SSD which is a lot of pull on people building AI training infrastructure.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Eddy [ph] for Krish. Two-part question, if I may. On nearline HDD congrats on great progress there. This is the second quarter of above 50% market share for you guys versus historically your share being in the low 40s. I wonder if you think this has anything to do with your main peer transitioning from PMR to HAMR? Or do you think this is more tied to specific customer exposure? And also, I wonder if you think you'd have that capacity within fiscal '25, given that your exabyte shipments are at all-time high.
David Goeckeler: We know -- we think that the share in our products is because they are great products, right? We're delivering the highest TCO products. We've had this road map for a long time. None of our customers are surprised by our road map. They know about our road map, quite frankly, years in advance and we work with them very closely. So we believe we're providing the highest capacity -- well, we are providing the highest capacity drives at scale. They're easily qualified. The architecture is well known to our customers. and they deliver absolutely the best TCO. And if you're building a data center architecture at the scale our customers do, TCO is incredibly important. And now we've delivered a 32-terabyte drive. First time anybody has crossed the 30 terabyte at scale, that's sampling really great TCO. And then the UltraSMR side of it, these drives can deliver 20% more capacity with UltraSMR versus a typical SMR drive which is 10% more capacity that's great for our customers. They get more capacity per unit. It's great for us because we get 20% more capacity or the incremental 10% without adding any COGS to the system, so that's margin accretive. That's very nice. And we're seeing now the third hyperscaler starting to adopt our UltraSMR technology starting in the second half of the year. So we just feel really good where the portfolio is. We think this portfolio has been in development for decades to get to this point. These were decisions that were made a long time ago given the lead times in this business. And so we believe we're -- customers are just responding to great products. And the TCO increases in the supply-demand balance allow us to also work on the pricing side of it as well. So as far as capacity, look, I mentioned it earlier, we got to this 52-week lead time that was really important because now we're starting to get forecast from our customers a year out. It gives us the ability to plan for capacity. So as we get -- as those forecasts come in and we roll them up and we work with our customers and we look at that, what that picture looks like, then we'll be in a position to address this issue of do we add capacity. But we don't want -- we're not going to add capacity for a 2-quarter increase in volume. We think this is much more sustained than that. As I talked about, AI is going to be a big driver -- the AI Data Cycle will be a big driver for HDDs as well. We see sustained demand into the future. But we want to see the commitments from our customers and them to give us that visibility and we now have that in place. And as we get the whole market, all of our customers looking at that over the next quarter or so, we'll have a better I think a better way to answer that question of do we plan to add capacity. But for right now, we're happy with where our capacity is. and what we're able to ship and mix keeps going up and we're able to ship more exabytes per quarter based on mix.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: I guess maybe just focusing on the HDD side again. I think the fear everyone is going to have is, are you sitting at close to peak performance at this point, both from how much exabyte you are shipping versus the last week which I think within 10 exabytes of that? And where the gross margins are. So maybe if you can just focus on gross margins up. Can you just talk about what is the right way to think about HDD gross margins assuming exabytes keep growing and your conviction that pricing can remain favorable on the HDD side or through the back of this year and potentially into '25?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think the whole key to that question is to continue to innovate. It's just as simple as that. If we continue to innovate and build a better product and deliver a better TCO to our customers, we're able to continue to participate in the value of that R&D that we're spending. We just announced a new drive that's 32 terabytes which is 13% more capacity than next biggest drive on the market which is our 28-terabyte drive. So as long as we continue to do that, we go to our customers and they get a better value proposition and we're able to participate in that. And as long as we continue to drive the road map forward and I have a tremendous amount of conviction that's the case, we're going to do that. We will continue to drive margins higher in this business.
Amit Daryanani: Maybe just help me clarify this. Is the performance on the HDD side, more a reflection of your peer has not had HAMR come out yet. And once that comes out, perhaps market share and gross margins normalize, I guess, the feel would be, is this all durable? Or does it go away from a margin perspective once Seagate has HAMR in volume production with the hyperscalers.
David Goeckeler: No. Like I said, I don't think it has -- it has to do of continuing to deliver greater TCO. The underlying technology that you're delivering on the product I don't think matters that much, right? It's like customers want more density in the same slot and we're able to deliver that. We have a road map to deliver that. Other people in the industry have a road map to deliver that and we're going to continue to drive TCO down. We get better visibility into ordering. I've talked a lot about, I think, hard drives have been an industry that's been persistently oversupplied given the client to cloud transition. We're past all of that now. And I think we're seeing what the dynamics of the industry are like when we get the supply-demand balance right. We get our manufacturing footprint the way we want it. We deliver world-class leading products that provide enormous amounts of value to our customers. And we're -- that drives margin higher because it's a great value proposition for our customers. It's a good deal for them. It's a good deal for us. And I think that is incredibly durable.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Just -- I mean, obviously, very solid execution on the gross margin side, I think, is the highest in 5 years. But as you look at the road map forward, can you level set where you think hard disk drive and NAND margins could get to? Because I think in the past, obviously, NAND margins have gone like 45%, 50%. And I think we see hard disk drive margins at 38%, 39%. Could you help us like how to walk to the margin ARPU going out?
David Goeckeler: I think in the -- look, so next quarter, margins in both business are going up which is what we want. And I think as long as we continue -- in the NAND business, we -- again, we have to continue to innovate and bring great products to market and I think our portfolio is as strong as it's ever been. And we've always -- we've been strong for a long time in consumer. I mean that's been a stalwart of the business for a very, very long time. We have a very strong client portfolio. We have a very strong gaming portfolio. We've always been good in mobile and now we have enterprise SSD, where we're building out the portfolio right at the time where the AI Data Cycle is really driving a significant amount of demand. So I think from a technology perspective and where the portfolio is positioned, we're in very, very good shape. At that point, we look at long-term supply-demand balance of the business. We all know it's a cyclical business. You have to add CapEx in very large increments to bring on capacity, nodal transitions give you more capacity. We talked about this in our new era of NAND. I think this idea that the layer race and let's just put bigger and bigger nodes on the market and count on elasticity to soak up all the bits. Like I think that era of NAND is in the past, the era of NAND in the future is more strategic introduction of new nodes that add capacity, more innovation within the node on performance, power, capacity and so that, I think, is something that says the way we're going to manage our business is different than it has been in the past. And then, we look at just the overall supply-demand balance. And there's been not a lot of CapEx spending in NAND coming out of the downturn. And so we see a good supply-demand balance. So we expect to see continued positive momentum in the portfolio. On HDD, this is a business that is, like I said in the prepared remarks, we think it's gone through a remarkable transformation over the last year, really. We're starting to see the -- we're starting to see the results of this transformation that's been going on, quite frankly, for a long time. One is about getting through this client to cloud transition. Industry has been in that position for 15 years probably. So we're kind of through that now. Client is just a much, much smaller percent of the portfolio. Even if you look back to the past peak of our business, client was a much bigger percent just 3, 4, 5 years ago than it is today. So it's a cloud business now. We continue to deliver really strong TCO gains with our technology road map. And I think the business has a long road map on continuing to be able to drive better TCO for our customers. And then on the demand side, you've got -- again, you've got AI now the AI Data Cycle where HDD is going to be a big part of that on the input side, all of this data is stored on HDDs. And on the output side, people producing a lot more content to be stored on HDD. So we see a good demand environment, good business practices of getting the right visibility into how we should add capacity, so we don't end up in an oversupplied market. So I think the HDD business has structurally changed. I see the margins going higher and going higher in a structural way that will be maintained at a higher point. It's not a value proposition question. The value is really there. And like I said, we continue to drive TCO lower. We're going to continue to drive margins higher.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: I was wondering maybe you could square your comments a little bit on proactively mixing bits across end markets in a quarter where your bit shipment declined below what you had originally expected. But at the same time, you also had inventory build in the quarter. And as a clarification from a prior question, could you just help us think through in the September quarter, what is the like-for-like ASP trajectory for NAND as well.
David Goeckeler: Okay. So first of all, the mix, I think, the first one was the mix question. So was the question in the quarter?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, in the fourth quarter, it's how do we proactively -- how we proactively mix the bits to generate better profitability.
David Goeckeler: When bits were declining. Okay. So yes. I mean, look, I mean, I guess, in a big picture, we're always just looking at every market that we're in and what demand is on a week-over-week basis and what our customers are telling us and we're trying to put the bits to where we're going to get the highest return. We saw some headwinds in consumer. So we mixed into other parts of client business. And we also saw really good growth in enterprise SSD. I think we saw 60% sequential growth in enterprise SSD. So that provided a floor on kind of how we think about the mix side of it. And the second part of the question?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, the -- so on the -- maybe on the comments on the inventory, Wamsi, it's not unusual for exiting the June quarter for us to have inventory builds as we get prepared for the second half that tends to be more consumer oriented and sort of there's more shipments that typically take place. And so we're comfortable with that. Yes. So on the like-for-like for the September quarter, we're expecting the ASPs in NAND to be slightly up in the sort of low single-digit percentage range.
Operator: And our next question today comes from -- excuse me, Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I had one quick clarification and one question. On the clarification, the dis-synergies, we saw the $35 million to $45 million you guided to for the December quarter, is it fair to assume that's kind of a steady state for the combined business going forward post separation? Or do those costs go away? Or do those costs potentially go up beyond separation. That's my clarification question. And then my question for Dave on the NAND side, -- are your fabs fully loaded at this point? I know at the trough of the cycle, you had cut pretty significantly along with your peers. But where are utilization rates today? And how should we think about fiscal '25 CapEx?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Let me -- thanks, Toshiya. Let me take the first part of the question. So with respect to the synergies costs that I discussed for the December quarter, they range in and you noted $35 million to $45 million. This is -- it's fair to assume that this is where steady state will be until the separation and going forward.
David Goeckeler: And then on the NAND -- the fabs are -- we're running at full utilization. We don't have underutilization costs on NAND at this point. And then the third part of the question.
Wissam Jabre: On the CapEx.
David Goeckeler: FY '25 CapEx.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So on the CapEx side, look, we're -- what I'm -- what I think, we will share is where we see CapEx in this current quarter. And the -- from a cash CapEx perspective, for this quarter, I expect it to be more or less in line with the fiscal fourth quarter which was around 2% of revenue. And our thoughts on CapEx with respect to basically future investments haven't changed, we'd like to continue to focus on the profitability of the business. And at this point in time, that's really our main focus.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Fox at Fox Research.
Steven Fox: I was just wondering how -- given experience in prior cycles on the HDD side and you mentioned the 52-week lead times, how do you sort of protect yourself against customers being overzealous with orders and then maybe disappointing you down the road? What are you doing to make sure customers live up to their promises.
David Goeckeler: I mean, these are very big relationships with very big customers. So we're very close to them on a day-to-day basis. So that is clearly something we look for. But I think there's a lot of relationship value here as well. So we'll be on the lookout for that. But we expect our customers to be fairly rational about this whole process. I mean, look, we're in an area of HDD where almost everybody that we talk to would like to have more HDDs right now. So I think everybody is understanding that giving us more visibility will allow us to set our manufacturing infrastructure in a way where we can satisfy the market without ending up in the situation we are in, in the down cycle where we were having to really, really cut costs and quite frankly, move a lot of people off the payroll which is an unpleasant exercise. So we'll stay very close to our customers. And we have also have a lot of information on kind of ordering patterns and all that kind of stuff. So we'll keep an eye out for that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.
Asiya Merchant: Great If I may, just if you can talk a little bit about the industry structure that has changed and maybe how it reflects in your cost declines across both your Flash and HDD business. how we should think about that going forward, given that you see a favorable pricing environment and if you can balance that with maybe improved cost decline for both NAND and HDD.
David Goeckeler: Yes. So on the HDD side, there's been a couple of things that are -- have been contributing to better margins getting here. One is just we reset the manufacturing base and we've been coming off a very low number. So as we produce more and we get to full utilization, we get better cost per unit out of that. So that's been a good tailwind. But we're -- as I talked about, we're at the point where we know where all the drives over the next couple of quarters are going. And then the other part of it is as you said, technology-driven cost improvements, continuing to innovate, deliver better TCO, better cost dynamics. And we continue to drive down the cost per terabyte on the HDD business. It's going down like high single digits a year or something like that. On NAND, of course, we continue to drive cost down in the 15% range for this year, we're still good with that number. So that's a big part of the storage industry, has continued to drive the cost down through technology innovation and we feel very good about where we are in the R&D teams we have that can continue to do that.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Goeckeler for closing remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. You appreciate your time today. We look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. We're very happy with where the business is and where we're driving, we think the portfolio is in a great shape and things are going in the right direction. We look forward to talking to you about it more as we move throughout the quarter. Thanks for your time today.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful evening.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-04-25 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plan and performance, the separation of our flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our third quarter of fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered excellent results in the quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, all of which exceeded expectations. Our strategy of developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets, coupled with structural changes we have made to both of our businesses, is unlocking our true earnings potential and allowing us to continue improving through-cycle profitability and dampening business cycles. This strategy enables us to generate higher earnings per share even in a constrained supply environment. In addition, our commitment to achieving operational efficiency and enhancing our agility has allowed us to run our flash and HDD businesses more efficiently and further drive innovation to take advantage of new opportunities. In particular, as the technology landscape continues to evolve, the demand for AI solutions is becoming increasingly apparent across our end markets. The uptick in AI adoption is highlighting the incredible value of data and will drive increased storage demand across both HDD and flash at the edge and in the core, providing greater long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities for Western Digital. We are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of this company, and our team remains focused on improving the profitability of our business to drive long-term margin expansion and shareholder value as these new demand opportunities present themselves. Before I dive further into the demand environment, I want to briefly comment on the status of the separation of our flash and HDD businesses. I am proud of the team's ongoing efforts as we drive towards completion of the separation in the second half of the calendar year. We remain focused on achieving the separation as soon as possible, and we'll continue to provide further updates on our progress as appropriate. Moving on to end market commentary. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, revenue in all of our major end markets returned to year-over-year growth. In cloud, we experienced 29% growth in revenue from a year ago, highlighting the incredible success of our industry-leading HDD product line. In addition, we began to experience an increase in demand for our flash-based solutions, signaling a long-awaited recovery in this end market. In client, 20% revenue growth from a year ago was driven by increased bit demand for our flash-based solutions, coupled with an increase in ASPs. In consumer, we experienced 17% revenue growth from a year ago, highlighting the power of the SanDisk premium brand. Higher flash bit sales, combined with a better pricing environment more than offset the continued decline in consumer HDD demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with flash. Our sequential revenue growth in the quarter reflects the continuing commitment to disciplined capital spending and carefully optimizing bit shipments into our most profitable end markets to take advantage of the improved pricing environment. This approach, combined with the strength of our product portfolio has enabled us to drive significantly higher profitability while strategically managing our inventory. On the technology front, we achieved a significant milestone by initiating mass production of our QLC-based client SSD, leveraging BiCS 6 technology. This is yet another significant milestone demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. These advancements pave the way to spearhead the market's transition to QLC-based flash solutions in calendar year 2024. Additionally, our progress with BiCS 8 is on track. While this technology is ready to be productized as market conditions warrant, our innovative offerings will remain at the forefront of the market, further strengthening our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. As noted earlier, in the third quarter, we began to experience an increase in demand for our enterprise SSD solutions. We are seeing demand returning for NVMe SSDs that we qualified before the downturn. We are also experiencing significant interest in providing these products in dramatically higher capacities for AI-related applications which we expect to ship in the second half of the year. In addition, we are also sampling our newest high-performance PCIe Gen 5, BiCS 6-based enterprise SSD. We are preparing for qualification at a hyperscaler and the product is generating significant interest in the enterprise market. We expect to ramp in the second half of the calendar year. Turning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improved nearline demand and higher pricing as we focused on optimizing profitability per exabyte sold. In particular, nearline revenue reached a fixed quarter high, reflecting the successful strategy we put in place to bring the most innovative, high-capacity and high-performance drives to market. We have the right products at the right cost structure, which are reflected in our financial performance. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR with our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte UltraSMR drives, quickly becoming a significant portion of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments. SMR-based drives represented approximately 50% of nearline exabyte shipments in the quarter. Our portfolio strategy to commercialize ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies in advance of our transition to HAMR, has proven to be the winning strategy and enables us to deliver to customers the industry's highest capacity and leading TCO drives, all of which can be produced at scale with controlled costs. We are confident that our product strategy, which combines UltraSMR technology with upcoming advancements in nearline drives is enabling Western Digital to deliver best-in-class gross margin in HDDs all at a time when AI is emerging as another growth engine for the industry. As we move toward a new supply and demand environment, characterized by higher demand, supply tightness and product shortages, we are leveraging our proven technology we've already introduced to the market to meet the demands of our customers with the right portfolio at the right time, while also operating with a lean cost structure for continued profitability improvement in our HDD business. Although the actions we are taking have improved profitability, we remain focused on driving higher margins to appropriately value the incredible amount of innovation and TCO improvements we continue to deliver to our customers. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. Within Flash, in addition to growth opportunities at the edge, which is Western Digital strength, we are encouraged by the returning demand within the enterprise SSD market and expect growth throughout this calendar year. AI-related workloads are driving increasing demand for enterprise SSDs, and our portfolio is well positioned to support those use cases. Looking ahead, we anticipate bit shipments to remain flat into the fiscal fourth quarter and look to Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver led by our focus on allocating bits to the most high-value end markets amidst the tightening supply environment. While we're pleased to see pricing trends moving in a positive direction, it's crucial to acknowledge the importance of maintaining capital discipline and only reinvesting capital back into the business once profitability improves further, and we see sustained demand. Overall, our continued focus on improving profitability through our innovation road map, disciplined capital spending and strategic pricing initiatives position us well for continued success in calendar year 2024 and into 2025 by offering the most capital and cost-efficient bits in the industry. In HDD, the success of our portfolio of leading capacity enterprise products, combined with the restructuring efforts we've implemented in recent years are yielding improved unit economics and greater visibility. As cloud demand is recovering, we anticipate continued growth driven by higher nearline demand and better pricing as we are now in a supply-constrained environment. We're optimistic about aligning the pricing of our products to better mirror the innovation we are integrating into them, supporting long-term margin expansion in our HDD business. As we reap the rewards of the innovation and operational efficiencies that we've implemented, we will look for opportunities to reinvest in the business when the conditions are ripe for expansion. We will approach every capital allocation decision with a focus on discipline. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial third quarter results.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, Western Digital return to profitability and free cash flow generation and delivered great results in the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, up 40% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 45% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, up 45% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The growth was primarily attributed to higher nearline shipments and improved nearline per unit pricing with Flash revenue up both sequentially and year-over-year. Nearline bit shipments of 108 exabytes were up 60% sequentially. Client represented 34% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase in Flash ASP more than offset a decline in Flash bit shipments, while HDD revenue decreased. Year-over-year, the increase was driven by growth in both Flash and HDD ASPs and Flash bit shipments. Consumer represented 21% of total revenue at $0.7 billion, down 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, both Flash and HDD were down at approximately similar rates and in line with seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by growth in flash bit shipments and ASP. Turning now to revenue by business segment for the fiscal third quarter. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, up 2% sequentially as ASP increased 18% on both blended and like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 15% from last quarter as we proactively focused our flash bit placement to maximize profitability. Flash revenue grew 30% from fiscal third quarter of 2023 on higher bits and ASP. HDD revenue was $1.8 billion, up 28% from last quarter, as exabyte shipments increased 41% and average price per unit increased 19% to $145. Compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 17%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 25% and 33%, respectively. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 29.3%, well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved 13.8 percentage points sequentially and 18.7 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing, our continued focus on cost reduction, and lower underutilization charges. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 27.4%, up 19.5 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 points year-over-year. There were no underutilization charges in the quarter. HDD gross margin was 31.1%, up 6.3 percentage points sequentially and 6.8 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $17 million or 1 percentage point headwind. HDD gross margin is within our long-term target range, including underutilization charges. This underscores the team's focus on cost reduction and profitability as previously, this level of gross margin was achieved with higher revenue. Operating expenses were $632 million for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential increase was mainly driven by higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected financial results. Operating income was $380 million, which included HDD underutilization charges of 17 million. Tax expenses in the quarter was $51 million, reflecting the improved financial outlook for the fiscal year. Fiscal third quarter earnings per share was $0.63. Operating cash flow was $58 million, and free cash flow was 91 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash inflow of $33 million. Third quarter inventory was flat from the prior quarter at 3.2 billion, with days of inventory increasing 4 days to 119 days. A decline in HDD inventory offset an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.8 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, and total liquidity was $4.1 billion, including revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion and project sequential revenue growth in both HDD and Flash. In HDD, we expect continued momentum with our industry-leading SMR product portfolio aimed at the cloud. In flash, we anticipate bits will be flat and ASP is up as we continue optimizing our bit placement to maximize profitability. Gross margin is expected to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $670 million and $690 million with the increase mainly related to certain project-driven investments, coupled with higher variable compensation as the financial outlook has continued to strengthen. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal fourth quarter and $130 million to $140 million for fiscal year 2024 as the financial outlook improved. We expect earnings per share to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 342 million shares outstanding. The financial outlook has strengthened, and we will remain disciplined in executing the business, controlling our capital spending and improving our profitability. I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I'm pleased with the team's performance in developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets. As industry supply and demand dynamics continue to improve, we will remain disciplined around our capital spending and focused on driving innovation and efficiency across our business. Coupled with the structural changes we have made to our businesses, we are confident in our ability to drive greater through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As we move forward, we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on the promising growth prospects that lie ahead, solidifying our leadership position in the industry, particularly as AI continues to drive new storage solution opportunities and growth. Okay. Peter, let's start the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the HDD side, the gross margins are spectacular and if we take out the underutilization you're north of 32%. So, curious from here as you think about on-going tightness, on-going growth in demand led by the cloud and a pricing strategy where I think you and your main competitor are being extraordinarily rational. How do you think the progression for that part of your business will look through the remainder of calendar '24 and into '25?
David Goeckeler: Hi, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- the HDD business, we're really happy with where the portfolio is at. I think that's where it starts, bringing great products to market that deliver the highest capacity points and the best TCO for our customers and when we're able to do that, we can share in more of that TCO advantage we're bringing to market. I think that's been the strategy for quite some time, and we're really happy with where the portfolio is and it's really resonating with customers. But the other side of that is making sure we really control the cost side of it, so we're really focused on making sure we bring the lowest cost product as well and that leads to the margin expansion. And then we -- of course, we've got a returning demand environment as we get the cyclical recovery in HDD spending coming off of the lows that we all really understand. Going forward, we talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. We expect to continue to bring great products to market. We expect to continue to drive better TCO for our customers and we're in an environment now where we have supply/demand balance and we've -- significant restructuring of our business during the downturn. We've taken capacity -- we've set our capacity of what we think the market needs as we emerge into this demand environment. We do see better supply/demand alignment. We see tightness in the market, that's leading to what you would expect as customers giving us more visibility into what their ordering looks like going forward. So we're optimistic about being able to continue to drive profitability of this business higher.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, on the NAND side, I think you guided last kind of high-teens bit growth and I'm just curious, is that still a number in play or given your prioritization of highest profitable areas of NAND, should we be thinking about a different number? And you're not talking about production, but actual revenue bits?
David Goeckeler: You mean for our -- for what time period, just to make sure I understand your question?
C.J. Muse: My apologies, for calendar '24.
David Goeckeler: Calendar '24, look, we see -- yes, we still see demand in the mid to -- call it, the mid- to high teens for the market. We see supply like about 8% of bits in production. So we still see an undersupplied market. For us, we had bits down this quarter, we forecast them down double digits. We were right about that, maybe a little bit more flat going into next quarter as we kind of optimize our supply throughout the year where we can think we can get the best profitability.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you C.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you and congratulations on the results. In terms of the outlook, looking for 4 points of gross margin improvement, it seems like the like-for-like pricing, certainly in NAND is a lot better than that. HDD seems pretty good as well. What are the offsets that you only would see sort of 4 points of gross margin expansion given the improvement that we're seeing in absolute pricing?
Wissam Jabre: Hey Joe, thanks for the question. Look, our guide comprehends a balanced view of what we have in terms of information today with the outlook; yes, we see improvement in margins in both of the businesses. So on the flash side, we still anticipate improvement in pricing that will help gross margin move a bit higher from here. And on the HDD side, as David mentioned, we continue to focus on the obviously, the great technology that we deliver, but also the cost discipline and pricing of the products. So, all of these are comprehended in our guide.
Joe Moore: Great and then as a follow-up, you sort of talked about these higher density SSDs in the second half of the calendar year for AI purposes. Can you talk about what has to happen to sort of get those drives out? Like is it you need new capacity points that you don't currently serve and then can you talk generally, it seems like AI is having some positive effects on both sides of your guys' business. Can you talk about that a little bit?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So what I would say about the AI demand as it's coming into focus. I don't think it's so much in the results just yet, but we're seeing where it's going to impact both businesses. And clearly, one of them you just outlined, which is we're seeing enterprise SSD demand return, we saw some increase in the last quarter. We expect some increase in this quarter. But really, as we look to the second half, we have customers coming to us wanting the kind of SSDs we built and qualified before the downturn. They just want them in much bigger capacity points, 30 and 60 terabyte capacity points. So it's the same product just taking it and increasing capacity and going through a qualification on that so we're in that process with customers. We also introduced a new SSD that's more compute focused, which is PCIe Gen 5 product based on BiCS 6, very high performance that plays a little bit different role in the AI training stack and we're getting very good feedback on that product. It's being qualified by our starting qualification, we samples. We're kind of getting rid of the qualification of the hyperscaler and we're seeing good demand in the enterprise market as well. So we feel like the portfolio set up well as we go into the second half, and we're seeing a lot of demand show up for people that are very building large amount of infrastructure for model training.
Joe Moore: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. The first question, I just want to go back to kind of like the gross margin dynamics with regard to the hardware business. David, if you look back a couple of years, right, you peaked at like 150, 155 exabytes of capacity shifts. As we hear about the industry being constrained, where do you -- where would you characterize your capacity footprint today? And is it fair to assume that you have to see gross margin at or even above the high end of the 31% to 34% target model that you've laid out to kind of come back in and add capacity?
David Goeckeler: Yes. That's how we're thinking about it. This is a -- I've talked about this quite a bit and this is an industry that I think has been oversupplied with this client-to-cloud transition, it's been going on for 15 years. I think the downturn was in time when we saw a significant change in demand to say the least that we just decided to remove capacity to get supply and demand better balance. So as we -- we're just emerging into that market, Aaron. I mean I think as we start to see this market play out and dynamics get to the kind of business model and get more visibility into what the future is. We can have confidence in making investments if that's what we need to do to expand capacity I think as all of that comes into focus, and it's starting to happen. We're starting to see that. We're getting more visibility. We're getting to participate more in the TCO advantages that we're bringing to the market. We're seeing better dynamics and as that continues -- and we get more confidence, we're not there yet, then we would think about how do we bring more capacity into the market? But we're just at the -- we're kind of getting to the starting line is, I guess, what I would say.
Aaron Rakers: Yes that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, just on the enterprise SSD topic. I think prior to the downturn you had talked about, I want to say it was 2 or 3 cloud OEMs that you had designed in with the NVMe drive, can you just talk about the breadth of what you're expecting? It just sounds like you're kind of getting back into the market, optimizing displacement there. So how do we think about the breadth of the customer base in that enterprise SSD space?
David Goeckeler: Yes, you got -- I mean it's the -- what we're seeing now is when the market is coming back we're seeing those customers now come back up to a very long digestion period. And this is something we've been waiting for quite some time. Like every market from consumer to PC to near line on the HDD side has gone through this big digestion phase. And I think enterprise SSD was the one we were waiting to see when we're going to come out of that. And that's what we're starting to see. So we're seeing a couple of dynamics in that market. We're seeing those enterprise SSDs that we had qualified, the very same products now we're getting orders for as that digestion phase ends and they get -- they start to ramp ordering back. And then we're seeing the kind of AI impact on different capacity points, different use for model training we're starting to see that demand come in the market. So we're seeing both of those things happen. We think the portfolio is well positioned for those markets. We expect that to play out through the rest of the year and we're excited about it.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. On the HDD side, you had a very outsized exabyte quarter-on-quarter growth in the quarter relative to your nearest competitor. How are you thinking about the continued trajectory here in terms of exabyte growth perhaps both quarter-on-quarter basis, but also maybe calendar '24 versus calendar '23.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We're seeing -- I mean, big picture we're seeing a return in demand. Obviously, I think it was the largest sequential exabyte growth we've seen in a very long time. I hesitate to say ever because this is -- business has been around a very long time. But to go back as far as we could look, it was the biggest sequential increase we had seen. And it's -- as I said earlier that starts with having products that really resonate with our customers. We really believe very strongly in the technology road map we've built around ePMR and UltraSMR and is resonating very strongly with customers. Nearly 50% of exabytes shipped this quarter was SMR and we're set up well for what we talked about last time where we expect over half of our exabytes in FY '25 to be SMR-based. So like we said, coming into the fiscal year that we expected sequential growth throughout the fiscal year last quarter we extended that to the calendar year and we still see that. So we still see sequential exabyte growth going forward throughout this calendar year.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, on sort of reinvesting on capacity side, on the HDD side. I think you said when conditions are ripe for reinvesting, and I know to Aaron's question earlier you commented on certain gross margin ranges, but this cycle, your gross margin is much higher at lower revenue levels than past cycles. So clearly it feels as though at least you have the capability to drive peak margins much higher than your established long-term range. So why should 33 be maybe the level at which you reinvest? Why wouldn't it be 34, 35 or higher than that?
David Goeckeler: Well, we haven't really set a bogey for that. We want to look at the holistic marketing. Again, that -- I understand this question everybody is looking for when we would reinvest, but that's really not what we're even thinking about right now. We're thinking about getting a market that's balanced on supply and demand, delivering great products to our customers that can meet the needs of the growth of the cloud. And I think that to your point, I think the business is emerging what we planned for and a lot of hard work that went in over the last couple of years which is to come back in a much healthier position with the ability to drive greater profitability. So we're just getting back to the bottom of the range that we set a couple of years ago. It's not as if we're declaring victory in that at all to your point, like I said, I feel like we're just getting back to the starting line of where we need to drive the business to, but we feel very good about to be able to drive increased profitability in it. Look, it starts with delivering great products to your customers like we have to continue to bring better TCO. And I think we have got a tremendous architecture to do that while controlling our cost to build the product. We have to work stay focused on both sides of this equation. We got to have the lowest cost and then the best TCO that allows us to drive pricing which drives margin expansion. So we're working across that whole equation. And I think the strategy is working quite well. And that's why we saw -- when we saw some -- we saw the demand return, we saw the margins pop up. But to your point, we believe we can -- we're just getting started on this.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.
Karl Ackerman: I'm curious your thoughts on the decision to prioritize the transition to BiCS 8 for the mobile market rather than SSDs because AI demand appears concentrated in high-capacity enterprise SSDs. And I guess as you address that question, could you discuss your opportunity to provide QLC enterprise SSD to address these inference applications that appear to be supporting 30 and 60-terabyte units.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks, Karl. So haven't really said where BiCS 8 is going to go. That's in our future. That's one thing we feel really good about is the technology is there and we'll bring it to market when we see it's the right time to do that when we got the right profitability, the right supply-demand characteristics to invest in prioritizing that node, the technology is in great shape. But we haven't really outlined exactly which products are going to go there first or second or third. So that's still in our future. As far as your point on QLC, this is -- we're now starting to transition to BiCS 6. And so we talked about a couple -- a number of products here that are BiCS 6 based which first the client SSD, you didn't -- I'll talk about enterprise SSD as well, but we our client SSD has been extremely well received. The performance of it is outstanding. We have our own internal controller team. They've done an amazing job of building a really, really high-performance QLC client SSD. We expect that to lead the market and lead that transition in that part of the market and then we're bringing BiCS 6 into our enterprise SSDs as well. So that will be lever we have to drive BiCS 6 which gives us more capacity, better performance and so we feel good about that transition is now starting and the products are starting to show up. They're in customers' hands, and they've been very, very well received.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Karl.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Q – Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I have two questions as well, I guess. First on the HDD side, I'm wondering, do you think given some of the challenges on Hammer qualifications that Seagate's having, if you potentially saw a bigger uplift in market on the near line side and you think that market share could potentially sustain or does some of that kind of flow back as those qualifications get done. So I'd love to understand if the share gains you think you're seeing are sustainable or not. And then on the flash side I would like to just maybe get your perspective. I know you folks are talking about bit growth being flat in June. But as some of these qualifications ramp up in the back half how do you think about bit growth ramping up into the back half of this calendar year?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So on the first question, the business with our customers is planned pretty far in advance. So there wouldn't be a situation where something would happen intra-quarter and that would drive a big share shift. The reality is we've got great products, and they're very much resonating with our customers and we can deliver them at scale. And they have bring best-in-class TCO and clearly customers are adopting those at a significant rate. So -- like is it sustainable? We continue to bring great products to market. That's what we plan to do. We're very confident in our road map on HDD and we'll continue to bring the best TCO solutions to our customers. On bit growth, we do expect flat bit growth into the calendar Q2, but we'll see a pickup in bit growth in the second half of the year.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. Another question on enterprise is so you guys have been really smart on how you are allocating flash bits, right, with a strong focus on profitability. So as you reallocate more bits towards eSSD in the second half, is the profitability profile of enterprise SSD portfolio expected to be accretive to the overall flash business and your shares peaked previously sort of in that sort of high single-digit percentage range in enterprise. Just given a more competitive portfolio, like what type of share is the team targeting kind of mid- to longer term?
David Goeckeler: Okay. Thanks, Harlan, your questions are very related. So we saw a pickup in enterprise SSD in the March quarter. It's still -- quite honestly, it's still relatively small numbers, but it's growing quite well. So we wouldn't have supplied those bits if it wasn't the right thing to do from a portfolio strategy point of view. We'll see when we get to the second half, what pricing looks like, that versus other options we have, and then we'll decide how much supply we put into those products. And you're really getting into core of our portfolio strategy, which is to have a lot of optionality. We have a lot of optionality across client SSD, across gaming, now across enterprise SSD, across mobile, across consumer, obviously, which is a big business for us. And then based on what we see going into the quarter. And then very importantly, what happens during the quarter, how do we allocate our supply to get the best return? And clearly, we're in an environment right now where things got better throughout the quarter. So as we go through the quarter, we find more opportunity to mix and get more profitability, and that's what happened in the March quarter, and you saw the results of having that agility into the business. So I really don't want to call a share number or anything like that because it tends to distort, what we want to do is maximize profitability, not maximize share in any particular market. We want to maximize where we get the most return for our supply.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then maybe a question on BiCS 8. I know you're not calling out any timing yet, but you have had it sort of in preproduction for quite some time. How are the early yields on this technology? And I guess, more importantly, like can the team still drive mid-teens percentage annualized type cost down with the new bonded the raise technology?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So what I'll say about yields is we're very confident in the technology. I mean, we feel very, very good about it. It's a major advancement in the architecture OptiNAND from an industry perspective to the CBA architecture. And it's -- the development has gone well. We feel very good about it. We can productize it when we need it. Again, this gets into a larger conversation about the dynamics of the market and when is the supply needed, and we're going to be very, very disciplined about going through any transition or putting any CapEx to the market until we see the profitability that we want to get. So we feel very good about BiCS 8. There was a second part of the question.
Harlan Sur: On the cost downs.
David Goeckeler: Cost downs.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, maybe I'll take that, Harlan. Yes. On the cost down, we're still anticipating the mid-teens percentage year-on-year cost downs. So there's no change there.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Harlan.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carlos Colorado from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Carlos Colorado: Thanks for taking my question. So I have -- the first one is about nearline. You are going outperforming your competition by a lot. So what are the underlying reasons in your opinion for this? And do we have to expect this to normalize over time? And do you think this can be sustained? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes, the performance of the HD business is driven by the product, right? It's pretty straightforward. Products are -- they're great products. This architecture that we built on ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR, customers are really committed to SMR. They deliver the best TCO in the market. We can produce them at scale and that's what leads to the performance.
Carlos Colorado: Okay. Thanks and the follow-up is, you mentioned that AI has revenues are of SSD sales. You have a perfect vantage point to see if AI is driving applications that traditionally were HDD is that now being transferred to SSD some of those applications, or is the classic question on cannibalization from one to the other. Is that -- is AI change in that scenario? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: We do not see any cannibalization clearly, HDD plays a big role in the AI storage life cycle as well as the whole ingest phase because all of the big data lakes and all of the raw data sets, those are all going to be stored on HDD. It's just the economics of where you store that data and how do you access that data. It's all that part of the AI pipeline, if you will, is going to be HDD. Now you have all of these other new use cases around training and inference, and those are all going to be SSDs. So it's really about growth as opposed to substitution. And that's what's so exciting about this. And obviously, once you get the models trained, then the models are going to turn out more data, which is going to be stored on HDD. So you got this virtuous cycle going. So it's kind of literally rising tide lifts all boats. It's not a substitution game. Clearly, there's a lot of new use cases being developed around AI, like the whole training infrastructures that are being built, that's what's driving these very high-capacity storage-based enterprise SSDs that we're seeing demand for. So hopefully, that helps.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one on flash for Dave. You spoke about the BiCS 6 hyperscale qualifying it. My understanding was a BiCS 6 was kind of more like a sub node and BiCS 8 is going to be the bigger one. I'm just kind of curious to get to your enterprise SSD market share target. Do you really need BiCS 8, or can you achieve it with BiCS 6? And then I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: You're right. BiCS 6 is when we say stub node, it's we're not going to take the whole portfolio to BiCS 6. So we have a big portfolio, and we're choosing which products to take the BiCS 6. And clearly, we're taking the products that require QLC and the kind of things you're talking about. So we feel good about our node a plan in the fab being able to supply what we need in these markets.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. And then, Dave, on the hard drive side, I think you said in the past that you can get to 40 terabytes of the ePMR technology. I'm just kind of curious with obviously a competitor like trying to ramp up HAMR, and it took them a while like a few years to even get the 3 terabytes per disk in R&D to [indiscernible]. Can you give us an update on your HAMR road map or the status of your HAMR technology, how we think about 30, 40 terabytes plus.
David Goeckeler: So we've been working on HAMR for quite some time. We understand HAMR extremely well. We understand all the issues with HAMR, and what it takes to get it qualified. Clearly, we're doing that all behind the scenes because we have a product portfolio with the best TCO we can offer in the market today, and we can do that all the way up to 40 terabytes. And 40 terabytes is where the economics flip over and you get the 4 terabyte per platter or 40 per unit, where essentially the capacity increase will cancel out the increase in costs you have to put in the unit to get the economics to work on margin, right? That's kind of a complicated -- a lot to say in 1 sentence. But our portfolio is very focused on the right product with the right cost at the right time. The right time for HAMR is at 40 terabytes. And we've got a lot of development going on that product. We have for a long time. We, quite frankly, don't need to do it in public because we have another portfolio that's selling extremely well, which we've talked about throughout this process. But have a lot of confidence in our HAMR development. And quite frankly, our customers know exactly what we're doing, and where we're at and what our plans are, and they're comfortable with that as well.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, David.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Tom O'Malley: Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to do one on the CFO side real quick on OpEx. So big step up in the June quarter, and you're talking about some special projects. How should we think about that progressing? Is that investments that are going to stick around for the next couple of quarters? Or should that reset back to kind of the lower base you've been running out? You've just seen OpEx move from kind of the 550 to 660 over the past year, obviously, revenue increasing as well, but any color there on what that investment is for and if you see a step down after that?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Sure, Tom. So let me first start by saying that the way we think of OpEx is we don't see OpEx increasing faster than revenue. So we're still very focused on that cost discipline and OpEx discipline. When it comes to this quarter, we're expecting some increase. The increase is almost 50-50 driven by variable comp as the financial outlook has improved much faster than anticipated. So there's a bit of increase there. But also, as you mentioned, there's some project-specific R&D investments that also -- that we have sort of a direct correlation and line of sight to revenue. I would say for the next couple of quarters, the range that we've guided for Q4 is a reasonable range. I know it's too early to talk about fiscal year '25. But for modelling purposes, we can use the same type of numbers for now.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful. And if I look at your cost guidance for the year, a couple kind of with what you're looking at for June of '24, when I'm looking at gross margins, it seems like you need to have a pretty significant step-up in HDD gross margins. Are you planning for all of that the underutilization to come out of the model in the June quarter? And if any remains, can you let us know how much you're expecting?
Wissam Jabre: So for this most recent -- for Q3, we had a little bit -- and we disclosed, we talked about those. But as you can see, the numbers are becoming less and less significant. And so for the June quarter, there's still a little bit, but it's not really very significant for us to talk about on this call.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, Tom.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. David, Wissam. Just a quick question on the Flash side. Dave, when you look at the profitability, as you mentioned, how does the BiCS 6 compare to -- if you look at some of the competitive NAND out there, either in terms of die size or cost per gig versus some of the peers?
Wissam Jabre: So that's a very complicated question. I mean we can go into it in detail offline. We obviously do tons of work, and I appreciate your question that it's a multifaceted issue. It's die size, it's memory hole density, it's all kinds of very complicated thing goes into producing a NAND product. Look, we think the product compares extremely favorable. We think it leads the market. Again, for the last -- looking back many years, we have been able to produce bits at one third less CapEx than the industry average, and we expect BiCS 8 to continue that leadership in the market. So we feel very, very good about the product, about its performance. Again, when you build, this is like kind of one of the magic of wafer bonding. You can build the CMOS separately from the NAND stack and then the CMOS is kind of pristine. So the interfaces are really, really fast. So there's lots of good things about that architecture that leads to a really, really market-leading product, and we feel good about it. And we've got that all ready to go when the market the market conditions will support that level of investment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Most of the good questions have been asked. But David, I just have a longer-term question, and I think it will help many investors let's say, prices were to go sideways in '25, and you're just focusing on that 15% cost down and higher mix of higher-value SSD products. Can you help us understand how your flash margins would evolve from here? And then I'm not trying to ask you for pricing. But I'm just wondering how we could gauge your execution first, on the product mix and be on the cost down and how they both would manifest into higher margins.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Then let me first start with -- I'll take a stab at the answer, Mehdi. So look, our target model hasn't changed. We're still targeting through cycle for the flush business to be 35%, gross margin to be between 35% to 37%. And so that means, obviously, as -- from where we are today, we still have some ways to go to get to that through cycle margin. And the way we achieve these gross margins is what we've been talking about on this call. We focus on the product portfolio, the bit placement as well as on the cost side, which we still anticipate a similar type of ranges in terms of cost downs.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. That's reasonable. Let me just move on to the second question. And this is something I always ask, focusing on HDD. Is there any update how you see exabyte shipment evolving like over the next couple of years? Is the target now 25% to 30% or less or more?
David Goeckeler: We're not -- we're still in the 20% to 25% camp, maybe around 25%. That's -- we're clearly in a cyclical recovery here, getting back to that kind of through-cycle number. I think the kind of the question inside your question is how much does AI add on to that. And I think it's still a little early to tell. We definitely see -- as I talked about earlier, we see the value of data going up, you want to store more data to train more models. Those models are going to turn out more data. So we think that the bias is higher. I'm not in a position yet to call exactly how much it changes the slope of that line. So that's something we're going to stay very focused on as we go forward here over the next several quarters, stay close to our customers as these models get deployed and AI gets more broadly deployed and adopted so that we can dial in what we expect that impact to be on HDD storage demand. But we feel good that it's -- and we've got that secular tailwind to the business that will emerge.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
Steven Fox: Hi. Two quick ones for me. First of all, on the HDD side, your large competitors talked about having to sort of support the supply chain going forward. I was wondering what -- how you look at that option or need to do that? And then secondly, since cash flows turned positive again, I was wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of help on how to think cash flow tracks maybe versus net income or EBITDA over the next few quarters? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: I'll just say something about supply chain. Look, we stay -- we've stayed very close to our suppliers throughout the entire downturn and stay very close to them as we're planning the business going forward. So we think we always support our supply chain and Irwin Tan, who leads operations is based in Singapore, a lot of our suppliers are there, and he personally can stay very, very close to them. So we've stayed we've been very close and have supported our supply chain throughout this entire downturn. And now as things are getting better, that's a good situation for all of us. You want to talk about the cash flow?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, let me take that. So on the cash flow, yes, thanks. Obviously, we returned to free cash flow positive in Q3. And as the revenue and the business continues to recover, we're completely focused on profitability and cash flow generation. So we should expect that to improve from here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, thanks guys for taking the question. Just one for me. David, really, I think, piggybacking off the part of Mehdi's question. So just a TAM question on both sides of the business, HDD and Flash, is really the spirit of it that you see some near-term demand from AI coming and TBD on the impact to the TAM over time and also TBD on impact to the normalized growth rate off of whatever the new TAM looks like. And that's really the question. And TBD is the financing, but I just wanted to make sure we get all of your current opinions there. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: I think that's a fair way to say it. I think it's coming into focus as to where it's going to show up on both sides of the business, but it's -- to your point, we're not ready to call what it does to the TAM, besides, we believe, it's a tailwind to both TAMs. So clearly, on the NAND business, there's very specific use cases on model training that are coming up substantially. I mean, obviously, you're seeing that across the whole technology landscape. And maybe that's a little bit easier to see we're actually seeing demand for those kind of products in the second half. And for HDD, we see it as all the data that's going to feed that process is going to sit on HDDs. And obviously, once those models get trained, they're going to turn out data that's 85% plus of that is going to be stored on HDD. So we see a very, very good setup, but we're staying close to our customers in these markets. It's still a little bit early to actually put a number on it of what it does to the growth rate or the TAM size.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. A quick follow-up on this, which is how critical is it to have U.S. manufacturing for SSDs in relation to AI? And how do you look at partnership with hyperscalers as opposed to more kind of a general purpose business.
David Goeckeler: You mean U.S. manufacturing of the NAND itself or the SSD, which -- well, our NAND is manufactured in Japan. So we don't see that as -- we feel really good about our manufacturing footprint, by the way. So the JV, we haven't talked at all on this call about the JV, but that puts us in a great position from a scale perspective and gives us -- is the big underlying part of that low-cost lowest-cost bids, low capital efficiency and great product road map because we -- all of that is done in tandem with Kioxia, and so we're able to invest as the largest supplier in the market, which is a great position to be in. But we haven't -- the way our footprint is set up for a manufacturing point of view, we haven't seen anything that impairs us ability to serve the entire market. And as far as partnership with hyperscalers, like, look, we stay very close to the hyperscalers. Obviously, they're big customers of ours. We're big suppliers of theirs on both sides of the business. So we're very, very close to them and staying close to what are different use cases, how do they want the products built especially in the enterprise SSD market, every -- there's not just one enterprise SSD. Everybody uses slightly different interfaces and there's different ways, their architecture of their data centers are built. So we stay close to them to make sure we build the right product for what we're -- what the markets we want to serve.
Operator: And at this time, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to David for any closing remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate all of the questions, and we look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. Thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-01-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Analyst Call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will open the lines up for questions shortly. [Operator Instructions] Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, VP of FP&A and IR. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Well, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations. And as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, business plans and performance, market trends and dynamics, and financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the investor relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results. Western Digital second quarter results demonstrate that the structural changes we have put in place over the last few years and the strategy we have been executing are producing significant outperformance across our Flash and HDD businesses. I am confident that building leading products across a broad range of end markets, closely controlling our product cost through focused R&D and manufacturing, and bolstering the agility of our business will allow us to improve through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As a result, we reported revenue of $3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5%, and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.69, all of which met or exceeded the non-GAAP guidance ranges we provided in October. Before discussing the business details, I want to provide some comments on the emerging trends we are seeing and how the changes we have made position our Flash and HDD businesses to benefit. In Flash, we've been able to navigate business cycles by managing inventory proactively, offering a broad range of products, and optimizing capital efficiency through our joint venture partnership with Kioxia. These successful efforts are reflected in our best-in-class gross margin throughout the cycle. During the quarter, our portfolio strategy to dynamically allocate bit shipments drove upside in ASPs and gross margin. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to our supply and capital investments. Consequently, we continue to proactively manage our bit shipments to structurally align our supply and inventory with customer demand and improve through-cycle profitability into the future. In addition to the recovery in both Flash and HDD markets, we believe storage is entering a multi-year growth period. Generative AI has quickly emerged as yet another growth driver and transformative technology that is reshaping all industries, all companies, and our daily lives. Importantly, industry analysts estimate that the edge now represents approximately 80% of total NAND bit shipments, an increase from approximately 75% in calendar year 2022, which is another indication that cloud demand was significantly pulled in during the pandemic. In addition, we believe the second wave of generative AI-driven storage deployments will spark a client and consumer device refresh cycle and reaccelerate content growth in PC, smartphone, gaming, and consumer in the coming years. Our Flash portfolio is extremely well positioned to benefit from this emerging secular tailwind. In HDD, Western Digital's leading EPMR platform and enhanced UltraSMR technology allow us to provide the highest capacity drives for mass market deployment. We believe this innovative technology and portfolio strategy enable us to offer the best TCO to our cloud customers and outperform our peers throughout the cycle. We are confident that the multi-quarter near-line demand headwinds have subsided as our major cloud customers have reengaged with us. We anticipate our financial outperformance resulting from profitable share gains to become more evident as nearline demand accelerates into the second half of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving on to end market commentary. During the quarter, revenue in the cloud end market returned to sequential growth for the first time in six quarters. The sequential revenue growth was led by an increase in nearline shipments. In client, sequentially, revenue declined slightly as the increase in Flash ASPs was offset by a decline in bit shipments as we proactively optimized product mix. In consumer, the sequential revenue growth was led by seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments into retail and an increase in Flash ASPs. I'll now turn to business updates starting with Flash. During the quarter, the sequential revenue increase was due to stronger execution and driving price inflection by optimizing bit shipment across our broad go to market channels into the consumer and client end markets, resulting in stronger than planned ASP increase. In particular, our WD Black gaming SSD product, which offers high reliability, best-in-class performance, expansive storage capabilities, and a hyper realistic gaming experience, achieved a new record revenue with bit shipment growth of over 50% year-over-year. On the technology front we remain on track to ramp an array of QLC-based client SSDs utilizing BiCS6 technology. Our ability to combine this new high-performance node with our in-house controller development allows us to offer a portfolio of client SSDs with unmatched performance and value. We expect these products to lead the transition to QLC Flash in calendar year 2024. Additionally, BiCS8 yield is progressing well and we remain on track to productize this technology. Turning to HDD, the sequential revenue increase was driven by improving nearline demand and pricing. Moreover, we are encouraged by demand in China with revenue doubling on a sequential and year-over-year basis, both of which were ahead of our expectations. We anticipate year-over-year growth in HDD throughout this calendar year. In both the first and second quarters, we shipped approximately 1 million UltraSMR drives per quarter. We forecast UltraSMR hard drive shipments to increase significantly in the fiscal third quarter and SMR drive shipments to continue to outgrow that of CMR drives going forward. Importantly, the adoption of UltraSMR is broadening to our major customers worldwide, including a third cloud titan in the US this year, as well as hyperscale and smart video customers in China. We expect to complete the qualifications of our 26 terabyte and 28 terabyte UltraSMR drives at these customers this quarter and throughout the calendar year and forecast SMR to comprise the majority of nearline demand by calendar year 2025. We have strong conviction that our portfolio strategy of first commercializing Western Digital's industry-leading UltraSMR technology, which will be followed by our transition from EPMR to Hammer offers the best TCO to our customers in both the near and long term, while delivering leading portfolio profitability in the industry. Over the next several years we will be introducing a number of exciting products, including multiple generations of nearline drives combining EPMR, OptiNAND, and UltraSMR technologies in the 30 to upper 30 terabyte capacity range, all of which will be ready for high volume production to support the explosion of AI training data and content. Before I turn over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. In Flash, starting with demand in calendar year 2024, we estimate industry bit growth to be around the mid-teens percentage, similar to the growth rate in calendar year 2023. On the supply side, we estimate that fab-out bit production growth to remain in the mid-single digit percentage range. We believe our business agility and our highly capital efficient and low cost BiCS architecture have enabled us to align supply with demand via nodal transition much more quickly than our peers. We will continue our disciplined approach to dynamically managing our inventory capacities and capital expenditures to keep our supply aligned with end customer demand. Although Flash pricing has started to increase, our profitability and cash generation continue to be well below the level that justify an increase in capital investments. We anticipate wafer equipment spending will remain at historic lows in the near term and Flash to be undersupplied for an extended period of time. Overall, we will continue to focus on allocating our bids to the most attractive end markets and anticipate Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver throughout this calendar year. In HDD, our competitive portfolio strategy has enabled us to consistently achieve profitable share gain in the last two calendar years. We are confident that this trend will continue as nearline demand continues to improve and we continue to ramp our UltraSMR enabled products. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial second quarter results.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69, as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited Flash ASP and gross margin. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to that of center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in six quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in Flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher flash shipments, primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications, more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in Flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in Flash ASP, as well as lower HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially, as Flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bid shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments, offsetting lower prices. HDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially. As total exabyte shipments increased 14%, an average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5% above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially, while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher Flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage points headwind. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially, and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind. We continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year, and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased five days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in Flash, where Flash days of inventory remained at a four-year low. During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes and paid down $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to of $3.4 billion; we expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD; we anticipate Flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP; we expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million; we expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding. As the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. I want to emphasize that the steps the Western Digital team has taken to instill and deploy an industry leading product portfolio, while also moving quickly to adapt to both volatile market dynamics and anticipate future trends have enabled us to capitalize on the upswing we see ahead. Through our product leadership and ability to dampen business cycles and improve through-cycle profitability, I am confident we are well positioned to execute on our current strategy, which will reaffirm our strength over the long term. Let's now begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the gross margin improvement in Q1. I guess, how would -- how do you portion that between the drive business and the NAND business? And I guess, I would think with being judicious on volume, you get some pretty good NAND pricing. I guess, I might have expected a little bit more gross margin improvement. So just curious what I'm missing there? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yeah, Joe. So we've been it's good to see the pricing inflect. If you look into Q1, we were happy with the gross margin we delivered in the Flash business in the December quarter at 7.9%. I think we were able to capture the turn in the market well. So it gives us a little higher base going into the March quarter. But if you look at both businesses, you see Flash will be down on bits and up on price. So we see -- we still see strong price increases quarter-to-quarter, but we're down on volume. Let's call it, low double digits. And then in the HDD business, we see increase in volume and increase in price.
Joe Moore: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just kind of building off that last question, I know you talked about hard disk drive underutilization, expectation in this current quarter kind of embedded in that 22% to 24% guide. What's the underutilization assumption you're making on the Flash business? And just in general, how do you think about the trajectory of Flash gross margin? Let's say, in theory of pricing and your implementation of price increases continues, how do we think about the return to kind of a 30% plus gross margin in Flash? So just trying to think about the puts and takes in the guidance and then the longer term kind of view at what you characterize as normalized gross margin?
David Goeckeler: Hey, thanks, Aaron. So for Flash, in our guide, we don't have underutilization for Q3. In fact, we executed ahead of schedule and reached our targeted supply and inventory goals faster than what we anticipated. And so, as you know, we continue to dynamically manage supply and inventory to meet our end demand and so the fab utilization reflects that. If you recall, in our results in Q1, Flash inventory was down almost $400 million, last quarter we saw another over $200 million dollar decline in inventory. We exited the quarter at levels that we haven’t see in few years. So having said that, obviously, we will continue to be disciplined in how we manage our supply and inventory to meet end customer demand on Flash and also, of course, control our capital spend. With respect to your question at the 30%, let me clarify. Was your question 30% on the Flash or on the HDD side?
Aaron Rakers: Well, I guess, I'm going to say both, but [Multiple Speakers]
David Goeckeler: Yes, I thought I heard you say Flash. I was going to start talking about it. Well, let me start talking about HDD. Look, at HDD, we're pretty much very close to that level. When you look at what we delivered in the second quarter and when you also look at the guide, it does reflect the continuous margin improvement on the HDD side. And so, I also anticipate that there should be continuous improvement as the recovery continues in that business. So 30% is very much within reach. And we should be able to achieve it pretty soon. On the flash side, the --lot has to do with continuing to optimize the product mix to drive that ASP up. And also, of course, continuing to deliver on our cost reduction. And so, on the cost reduction, we've done well so far. We've been in the mid-teens. I expect us to also hit that mid-teens percentage cost reduction for this fiscal year. So, as the pricing continues to improve, I’d anticipate that we would be -- we would also be there -- let’s say in the next few quarters.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
CJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping to focus on the NAND bit side of the house. You're talking about optimizing product mix, but here we have bits down in December. It looks like they're down -- implied down again in the March quarter. So can you speak to, I guess, your plans there? When do you think that will open up? And can you be a little more specific in terms of which end markets you're focused on and how we should think about when they come to market and the timing and implications to pricing?
David Goeckeler: Yeah. So I'll start and Wissam can add some too. So yes, we had bits down, we had a record quarter last -- two quarters ago and then we were down a little bit this past quarter, then we'll be down more. I mean, it’s just a reflection of the flow through the underutilization that we were doing to kind of keep supply and demand matched. We've talked about this a lot and not let our inventory get out of control. I think we've been very good about keeping our inventory -- we're at a four-year low on inventory, so on the NAND side. So, look, CJ, we're just going to keep very focused on what demand is, where we're at in inventory, and adjust the utilization of the fab to make sure those stay aligned as we go forward. So I think as we said in the script, you kind of assume that throughout this calendar year, you're going to see most of the growth in Flash be from pricing.
CJ Muse: [Multiple Speakers] Go ahead, please.
Wissam Jabre: Now, I was going to move on to the second part of your question.
CJ Muse: Yeah, please go ahead.
Wissam Jabre: Okay. So mix is like -- mix is just a very dynamic process, literally day-by-day, week-by-week in the business. We have a big consumer franchise, we sell all over the world, we have hundreds of thousands of points of presence and retail platforms. We have a big channel business where pricing can get adjusted weekly, then all the way up to, obviously, the quarterly negotiated markets. So we're just always dynamically understanding where pricing is going to be. And then again, in each of those segments, we have different products. We have client SSDs that are WD Black all the way down to WD Green. So in different segments of the market, all with different price points, all with different margins, all with different demand profiles. And it's a constant process of just making sure we put the supply where we're going to get the best return. This last quarter we talked about, we mixed a little bit out of client and into consumer, as you would expect in a strong consumer quarter. And we'll continue to do that. The place where we're still waiting for it to come back is enterprise SSD, that’s still been pretty depressed and as that market starts to come back, we expect to mix into that as well.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. If I could ask just a quick follow-up. Wissam, can you shed some light on how to think about OpEx into June quarter and beyond? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, of course, CJ. So on the OpEx side, for the June quarter I expect us to be more or less in line. Beyond that, as the business profitability continues to improve, I expect a gradual increase. But we're laser focused on profitability and so I don't anticipate to increase our OpEx faster than revenue growth, of course. And when you look at look at where we've come from and where we are today. We're still at or maybe more than 20% lower than where we were at the beginning of the cyclical downturn.
CJ Muse: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, CJ.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. I have two if I may. The first, why do you think there was a doubling of China demand for [indiscernible] applications this quarter? And how sustainable do you think that is? I ask, because the Chinese economy hasn't been robust for some time, so any thoughts on that would be helpful.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I wouldn't attribute it to the smart video market. It's more of the China hyper scalers coming back and better demand there.
Karl Ackerman: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. I guess, [indiscernible] if I may. It's nice to see an improving outlook for March. Showing one quarter ahead of many of our expectations. However, I'm a bit surprised to see your NAND ASP trajectory in December below that of peers. So is there any reason why your NAND prices or ASPs perhaps would fall behind peers from here? And/or maybe there would be a catch-up opportunity as well. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Price, your price deltas, obviously, have a big dependency on your starting point and we were starting from a better gross margin position than anybody else in the industry by quite a bit. And then on top of that, you have mix based on what's happening in the quarter and kind of where the product is going. I think if you look at profitability of the franchise, it's still leading the industry.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Karl.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is now opened.
Tom O'Malley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. It's Tom O'Malley here at Barclays. I wanted to ask you [Multiple Speakers] So I wanted to ask on the competitive environment. Your competitor obviously talked about a million unit shipments of Hammer in the first half of the calendar year here. I just wanted to get your comments on, are you seeing any change in your interactions with your customers? Are they pointing to Hammer as a solution that they're going to move too early in the year? Can you just talk to just the broader ecosystem and if you are seeing a transition or if it's the other side really, clearly you are seeing some better trends with your UltraSMR drives. Just any color on that transition with your customers would be helpful.
David Goeckeler: I think customers just want to understand everybody's roadmap, right? And they're not looking for a particular solution. I mean, for example, we've been shipping EPMR drives for years versus PMR drives and nobody really asked us for EPMR drive. So they just want the capacity point at a TCO at a reliability level and be able to satisfy their demand. And I think that's the way we've optimized our portfolio. We've commercialized EPMR, we're very happy with the technology. We have UltraSMR on top of that. That allows us to deliver both highest capacity point in the industry, the best TCO position at very, very large scale. We can produce millions and millions of those drives per quarter. So that's what customers are looking for and they're looking to understand on your road map that you can continue to drive that TCO equation forward, because they're obviously betting extremely large data centers on our ability to do that. And our customers, I can tell you, our customers have an enormous amount of confidence in our roadmap, in our current products, and you're seeing that in the performance of the business. You're seeing accelerating growth, you're seeing better profitability, you're seeing share gains. That's a clear indication that customers are very happy with our products. Now in particular on the transition of EPMR to Hammer, I know this has gotten a lot of attention. For our portfolio, given our UltraSMR technology, it's been adopted by the market, Hammer does not make sense until we get to 4 terabytes per platter. Because Hammer adds a lot of costs to the product, so it adds a lot of costs to your bill of material. So we can deliver -- we see the next couple of generations or couple of years of ability to deliver a very strong TCO proposition at scale on the EPMR plus UltraSMR platforms that customers have clearly adopted. We see it as the majority of our demand in calendar year 2025. We will transition to Hammer when we get to that 4 terabytes per platter. That's the economic crossover, right, that we're looking for from a portfolio management point of view. So that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the technology, the transition, and how customers are thinking about it. I think it's very clear, customers are very happy with our road map and they understand in great detail where we're going.
Tom O'Malley: Perfect. And then just one quick one on HDD gross margins. I think, when you look at the underutilization charges that are still present, you can look at just taking that out and what that means to the gross margins over the next couple of quarters. But is there any way to frame like a revenue level that gets you back to that 30% gross margin target for the HDD business or is it kind of just a wait and see when utilization takes back up and it will get there eventually. Any way to frame that from a modeling perspective as to when that can get back to your range? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: So, Tom, if you look at our numbers and you adjust for the underutilization charges, we’re almost there. So, what I would say, instead of giving a number or movement, let's say, in quantifying it. What I would say is, I expect us to be at the 30% level, at a lower level than then our normal run rate that we've had in any priors through-cycle periods. We've taken quite a bit of cost out of our -- cost structure as you very well know. And so, that will help us get there at a faster phase. With respect to underutilization, I do anticipate to probably have a bit more in other quarter of underutilization beyond this one and then we'll see where we are in the June quarter. We can talk about it then.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.
Wissam Jabre: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: [indiscernible] the first one on NAND. Either Dave or Wissam, how do you think of the sustainability of NAND pricing into the back half, given that there's a view that first half pricing could be up. In a calendar year base, calendar first half we have over 50%. How do you think about the sustainability and what would be the trigger point for you to start adding capacity in that? And then just as a follow-up on the hard drive side, you kind of mentioned Hammer adds cost, which kind of makes a lot of sense, given the laser and NFT. Kind of curious, if you -- whenever you start doing it would you do it with 10 discs? And if the market wants a Hammer solution from WD, how soon can you get it?
David Goeckeler: Okay, there's a lot in there. So on NAND, we obviously look at a lot of things in NAND, there's a lot of stuff that goes into supply of NAND, from utilization rates, to nodal transitions, to CapEx investment, and it's a complicated equation. But our current view is, we see NAND under supplied for quite some time in the market and that's appropriate given where we are in the profitability of the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're happy to see the inflection in pricing and the performance of the business and it's ahead of where we thought it was going to be, but we've got a long way to go before we're going to get to the profitability levels where investments are going to come back. I think the answer to your question, we need very clear visibility into through-cycle profitability numbers that match our model. And we're coming out of a deep hole and that would imply that you need to be above your through-cycle level for a while to get to that level over time. So that's what we're looking at, and we expect pricing to -- pricing is notoriously difficult to predict and we're very careful that we don't forecast it, but clearly, we're predicting good pricing increases into the next quarter and we will stay very disciplined of managing supply and demand in our business. We talked about that, bits are down sequentially. On HDD, I'm sorry, could you just repeat the HDD question again so that I make sure I got it?
Krish Sankar: Yeah, sure, Dave. I was just trying to figure out on the HDD side. A, number one, in Hammer would you be doing it with 10 disks? Second one is, if the market wants a solution from Western Digital a Hammer solution, how soon can you get it out.
David Goeckeler: Yes, so let me -- we'll defer the details of product launch on Hammer and how many discs it's going to have until we get closer to that process. I mean, it's a project that's -- we're happy with where the progress of it is, given what I said earlier. We've got -- we've built a technology roadmap that allows us to get to 40 terabytes on very well proven cost controlled, high manufacturing ability technology and we're looking forward to delivering that to the market over the next couple of years. The reality is, there's no customer like demands a particular technology. The customer wants a capacity point at a certain TCO, at a certain level of reliability, and a certain level of performance. And our technology roadmap is built to deliver that. What's inside the box is less important. The real thing is, you have to deliver all of those that we just said and you have to be able to manufacture it at a level of millions and millions of units per quarter to satisfy the market. That's what our customers are looking for. Our EPMR and UltraSMR technology, that's exactly what it delivers. The ability to deliver increasing TCO, which -- if we can deliver increasing TCO, we can continue to drive pricing higher. We can produce it at very high scale, it can be qualified very, very quickly and it's very highly reliable and high quality product. And our customers are increasingly adopting that technology as you see from our forecast.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, David. Very helpful.
David Goeckeler: Thanks. The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you so much. Dave, I appreciate the answer you just gave around pricing, but if I could ask this in a slightly different way. How would you think about pricing, the runway that you have in Flash relative to past cycles? I mean, given that your commentary on how you managed your inventory, given your comments on expectation to be undersupplied for a long time, would you venture to say that the pricing runway that you have should be longer than what you had in past cycles? A - David Goeckeler On NAND. I'm sorry. Look, I mean, I think it's the cycle we just -- I guess we're not out of it. We're coming out of it. Like I said, like we're just taking the first steps out of a cycle we haven't seen before, I think in the 3D era. So, what we're doing, Wamsi, is just making sure we get our supply and demand matched and make sure we keep our inventory controlled and deliver the best profitability, given the portfolio we have and continue to optimize the portfolio that we can have the best mix and therefore the best profitability. It's very difficult to predict future pricing and -- but our general point is that, although things are going in the right direction, we're not close to a point where the CapEx investment is going to come back and I think that's the real number on what future supply is going to be. I mean clearly there's some utilization that is going to come back, but it's going to be needed, quite frankly. And we're going to wait to see on -- as I said through-cycle profitability where we have visibility to that, to reinvest more in this business.
Krish Sankar: Okay thanks. If I could, you mentioned about entering a multi-year growth period with Generative AI and especially at the edge, the demand for NAND bits. When do you thing that the industry will start to see this demand NAND bits at the edge start to reflect higher?
David Goeckeler: Yes, look, I think we're going to see it as we start to go into PC refresh cycles. We admitted that, we're still very early in this, right? Getting the cloud -- I mean the big part right now is getting the cloud capable of delivering GenAI to all of us, and then drive that architecture, down to the edge. I think we're starting to see in some of the markets some of the future specs of products where they're increasing the amount of NAND, so we're optimistic about that. As we go through the next couple of years when this architecture gets deployed and adopted. So I can't like put it down to a particular quarter for you, but certainly as new technology launches or new technology adoption, it's moving at a faster pace than any technology I’ve seen in the very long time.
Krish Sankar: [indiscernible]
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wamsi.
Operator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now opened.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to make clarification. David, did you say that demand is tracking to mid-teens and that compares to bid supply growth of 5%?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we see demand around mid-teens and that's fab out. What we see is kind of fab production of mid-single digits. And obviously, there's inventory between those.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Now what got me confusing is, you also said your NAND inventory is a multi-year low, did I misunderstand you?
David Goeckeler: You did not misunderstand me.
Mehdi Hosseini: So if your inventory is at multi-year low and demand [indiscernible] have all exceeding supply so you basically are not going to ship to supply, or you are not going to ship to demand throughout the year.
David Goeckeler: We'll ship to our share demand throughout the year.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Would that impact your marker share or you are focusing on [indiscernible] more profitable than market?
Wissam Jabre: No, we don’t anticipant that to impact our market share. The stats that you mentioned on the supply and production were for our estimates and what we see from third party estimates on the overall market.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. That’s overall market, not reflection of [Multiple Speakers]
David Goeckeler: Go ahead, Mehdi. I’m sorry. No, please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: So these are market trends, not so specific to Western Digital. And then, if I may just have a quick follow up. In terms of the NAND cost down, should we assume that long-term trend of down 10% in terms of CAGR, cost per…
Wissam Jabre: No, we're comfortable with the 15% cost downs. We believe that if you -- I mean, we're ahead of that right now in FY 2024, quite frankly, but it'll come back and I think when you look at the full year, you can still model 15% for the fiscal year.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. All right. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering on enterprise SSDs, you mentioned that they're still depressed and you'll mix into it. But given the supply situation that you just talked about and where we are in the cycle. Like, what is your -- how do you envision coming back in that market? And like, can you just remind us what a normal mix of enterprise SSDs looks like in your Flash business? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean, for us it was a -- it's an emerging -- it's an emerging part of the portfolio. I think, right -- going right into the downturn, we got qualified at numerous or a number of cloud titans in our NVMe based enterprise SSD, and then we kind of went into a market where, quite frankly, enterprise SSD has been the most depressed part of the NAND market in the downturn and we haven't seen that come back yet. So, as that starts to come back out of digestion, it'll just be another opportunity for us to mix into that. How much we mix into it will be depending on what the price is on that -- in that segment versus other options we have for those bits. So we don't necessarily -- we don't necessarily have a fixed percentage we're going for, it's just -- we have the product, it's qualified, as demand comes back, we'll consider that demand and part of the whole portfolio calculus.
Steven Fox: Would the big picture be that it trails enterprise HDDs by a certain amount of time in general? Like, do you have a vision for just -- as enterprise spending recovers, where that product cycle would be?
David Goeckeler: Well, certainly, it is trailing enterprise HDD. I mean, enterprise -- I don't know if I could make a generalization about that, because it's just one cycle here, but clearly there's more inventory digestion in the hyperscale market on enterprise SSD than there was in capacity enterprise HDDs. As we talked about, we see continued growth in capacity enterprise HDDs, we started out this fiscal year projecting sequential growth throughout the fiscal year and now we're talking about sequential growth throughout the calendar year. So we see good demand trends coming back on capacity enterprise HDD, which again is a good sign for enterprise SSDs will come back, because there's a little -- there's more inventory digestion to get through.
Steven Fox: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now live.
Mark Miller: Your cash flow significantly improved during the quarter, but still there was an outflow. When do you expect to be positive from a free cash flow perspective?
Wissam Jabre: Yeah, Mark. So turning free cash flow positive is a top priority for us. We are very much focussed on it and we have line of site to achieving it. We expect to achieve free cash flow positive in the second half of the fiscal 2023, either this quarter on the next. As you know, we typically don’t guide for cash flow.
Mark Miller: Do you expect to -- will you have to draw on your revolver or do you expect we won’t have to draw on it?
David Goeckeler: I don't see that at this point.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, Mark.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: The last question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, David. Thanks a lot. Just wondering do you guys have an early opinion on if NAND bit rate increases, as GenAI sort of impact, not just edge cycles, but sort of corporate cycles, Fortune 1000 and hyper scaler storage as well. And all the other sort of end market constituencies, do you have any opinion on if there's a sort of increase to NAND supply overtime? And if you do, do you think the increase could be material and noticeable? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: It's a good point here, which is, like -- my comments earlier were about the cycle and what we see in NAND and investing in. And we're big believers in the NAND market and there's going to be a lot of bit growth in the future. And also the great thing about the NAND market is, you still have the ability to produce new nodes and more efficient as far as how much capital you need to put in to get that growth. So, look, the overall thesis on NAND continuing to grow, we have a long technology roadmap where we can continue to deliver cost downs, that's still a great story and we expect -- to your point, we expect generative AI to be additive to that, especially on the edge. The NAND market has really rotated -- through this downturn really rotated to an edge centric market. Which, again, our portfolio is very, very well positioned with our consumer business, with our client SSD business, with our gaming business, with our position with PC OEMs. So, we're very well positioned there. And yes, as we see that demand come back, and it resets the economics of the industry, we have the ability to go satisfy that demand. And so, I think you are very bullish about that.
Ananda Baruah: That’s a useful context. Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: Thank you. All right, thanks everyone. I appreciate your time today. We will see you throughout the quarter. Take care.
Operator: This concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Western Digital First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today’s event is being recorded. At this time I’d like to turn the floor over to Peter Andrew, VP of FP&A and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, we have a lot of exciting items to discuss today. In addition to the earnings press release and slides, we also have a press release and slides regarding the conclusion of our strategic review. All of these materials will be posted in the investor relations section of our website shortly. Let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, spending and cost reductions, business plans and performance, market trends, financial results, the outcome of a potential separation of our HDD and flash businesses, including the form, timing, and tax-free status of the transaction, our ability to complete the transaction, the future performance of our separated businesses, and the creation of shareholder value by separating our businesses. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliation between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the investor relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will first discuss the completion of the strategic review and then turn to our first quarter results. We're thrilled to announce the completion of our strategic review and plans to form two independent public companies focused on capitalizing on the data storage industry's growth in HDD and flash. After evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, the Western Digital management team and Board determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. This transaction will allow each franchise to execute on its product and innovation roadmap and capitalize on the unique growth opportunities in their respective end markets. Each company will benefit from streamlined management focus, operational flexibility, and the ability to set its own distinct capital allocation and shareholder return policies. We are excited for the opportunities this transaction creates to better serve our customers, support our suppliers, partners, and employees, and unlock significant value for our shareholders. Before discussing the details, let me walk you through the journey that brought us to this point. In March 2020, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the company's unique position to accelerate and benefit from the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and how all of us live our daily lives. And importantly, I saw an opportunity to create value for a leader in both NAND flash and hard drives. During my early days at the company, I spent considerable energy into rebuilding and refocusing the company, including the formation of the HDD and flash business units. It soon became clear that our focus on driving two distinct technology portfolios was the right strategy, and the new management team that I brought and worked together to transform Western Digital by bolstering business agility and reinvigorating innovation. In addition, we promptly focused on strengthening our balance sheet. We made the tough decision to suspend our dividend, which allowed Western Digital to speed up debt reduction and paid down $2.7 billion of debt over a couple of years following the suspension. We further enhanced our liquidity by bringing in $900 million of strategic investment from Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management and amended our credit agreements. We also settled a long-standing tax dispute to increase strategic optionality. The groundwork we laid over the past several years, including the additional actions taken in fiscal year ‘23 to right-size the business, have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment, all while staying focused on delivering a range of industry-leading products. Each business is now in a strong operational position to succeed on its own and the actions we are announcing today will further enable each company to drive long-term success in the years to come. The Western Digital team and Board completed the strategic review after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives and determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. During our strategic review process, we evaluated material opportunities for each of our businesses. However, given current constraints, it has become clearer to the board in recent weeks that delivering a standalone separation is the right next step in the evolution of Western Digital and puts the company in the best position to unlock value for our shareholders, while providing strategic optionality for both businesses. Given the confidential nature of the strategic review, we will not be discussing any of the other alternatives that were considered during the process. On page six of the presentation, we present a separation transaction summary. The HDD business will retain the Western Digital name and become an independent publicly traded company. The flash business is expected to be spun-off in a tax-free transaction to Western Digital shareholders, and the name of the publicly traded company will be determined at a later time. We target to complete these plans in the second-half of calendar year ‘24, subject to the principal closing conditions described in the slide. Page seven provides a bit more visibility into some of the end market exposure for our flash and HDD businesses on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the individual businesses on page eight. In HDD, Western Digital is a well-known leader in the mass storage market with an ability to generate consistent cash flow on a standalone basis. Our ability to lead the industry in bringing new innovations to the hard drive market to enable higher capacity points for mass market adoption has established Western Digital as a key strategic supplier to the world's global cloud service providers, storage OEM, and distributors. The massive opportunity is driven by the ongoing expansion of the cloud infrastructure, connected to intelligent endpoints and powered by high-speed networks. Industry analysts estimate the HDD addressable market to grow at approximately 12% compounded annual growth rate to $25 billion over the next three years with cloud representing over 90% of the total addressable market. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital and we are well positioned to address customer storage needs. Moving to our flash business on page 10. The Western Digital flash business is well-known for its broad go-to-market channels, enviable premium brand retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio. Industry analysts forecast the flash market to grow at approximately 15% compounded annual growth rate over the next three years to $89 billion in calendar year 2025. We believe content increases in the consumer and client end markets, as well as explosive growth of data created in the cloud by emerging applications such as generative AI, virtual reality, and autonomous driving, are driving a faster growth in flash versus HDD. The highlight of our consumer end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and our suite of high-performance SSDs for gaming enthusiasts. The brand recognition and affinity, combined with our unmatched presence across the world, is a great setup for the business on a standalone basis. Our successful 23-year partnership with Kioxia continues to provide us a reliable source of high-performance, low-cost flash. Together, we have successfully brought to market numerous generations of flash technology with the industry's lowest cost and best capital efficiency. The joint venture fabs produce over 30% of the world's bits and our joint memory technology roadmap remains incredibly well positioned especially as we lead the industry's transition to wafer bonding. We will likely host an investor day closer to the time of the spin-off of our flash business to give investors greater clarity into the historical and future outlook for each of our businesses, along with the intended capital structures for each business. With that, I'd like to turn to first quarter fiscal ‘24 earnings review and business update. Western Digital's first quarter results exceeded our expectations as the team's efforts to bolster a business agility, drive innovation, and right-size the business have enabled us to capitalize on enhanced earning power in an improving environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $2.75 billion and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.76. Our ability to develop differentiated and innovative products across a broad range of end markets has resulted in sequential margin improvement across both flash and HDD businesses. In flash, healthy inventory levels on our balance sheet and signs that flash pricing is beginning to inflect have laid the groundwork for further gross margin improvements. Our broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio have enabled us to shift bits to the most attractive end market categories and achieve 26% sequential bit growth, as well as upside and gross margin. In HDD, our industry leading 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive became the highest near-line volume runner in just two quarters, which demonstrates Western Digital's aerial density leadership and ability to deliver high volume innovative technologies to data center customers worldwide. During the quarter, demand in consumer and client continued to improve, exceeding our expectations. In consumer, flash revenue has returned to growth on a year-over-year basis, led by strong content increases and unit growth. In client, PC and component demand also exceeded our expectations, and demand for gaming consoles and mobile remained resilient. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remains subdued. I'll now turn to the business updates starting with flash. During the quarter, flash revenue increased sequentially, led by record exabyte shipments and continued content growth in consumer and client end markets, including PCs and all retail products, as we continue to optimize bit placement in an improving environment. WD Black, which is optimized for gaming, continued to perform well, with bits shipments more than doubling and content per unit increasing over 50% year-over-year. We are in an excellent position from both of flash technology and capital efficiency perspective. Today, a majority of products we are shipping are based on BiCS5, the most capital efficient node in the 3D era that continues to provide an amazing cost structure and efficient capital spending. As we look into calendar year ‘24, we are ramping an array of QLC-based client SSDs based on BiCS6 technology to lead the expected industry transition to QLC. After BiCS6, we remain on track to introduce a broad range of high performance products based on BiCS8 technology with its unique chip bonded on array architecture. Turning to HDD, revenue declined due to lower nearline exabyte shipments driven by subdued demand from our cloud customers and slower-than-expected recovery in China. However, demand for consumer and client hard drives was stable. Western Digital has continued to lead the industry in driving innovation within the nearline market. Our ability to bring innovation into mass market drives that are quickly deployed into cloud data centers is reflected in our results as we successfully led the industry's transition to SMR-based nearline drives. Specifically, our 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive, which we first announced at our investor day, accounted for nearly half of our nearline exabyte shipments with total SMR shipments exceeding the 40% goal we laid out in the same quarter a year prior. We are on track with our 28 terabyte ultra-SMR drive qualification and have a clear roadmap of EPMR and ultra-SMR based innovations into the 40 terabyte range. These developments are a result of the choices we have made in the past few years through a combination of product R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we are proud of how we have been executing against our strategy. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, in flash we expect both modest bit and ASP improvement and a decline in underutilization charges to drive continued sequential improvement in both revenue and gross margin. In HDD, we expect higher nearline shipments and seasonal demand in consumer end market to drive sequential revenue growth. We anticipate our value-based pricing efforts and lower underutilization charges will lead to sequential revenue and gross margin improvement in the quarter and through the rest of fiscal year ‘24. As we continue to execute against our HDD product roadmap, we are setting the stage for profitable growth for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you and good morning everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal first quarter results exceeded the guidance ranges provided in July. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.75 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.76. Looking at end markets for the fiscal first quarter, cloud represented 32% of total revenue at $0.9 billion, down 12% sequentially, and 52% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to lower nearline hard drive shipments to data center customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in shipments for both hard drive and flash products. Client represented 42% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 11% sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was due to growth in flash-bit shipments. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in flash pricing. Consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.7 billion, up 14% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by both higher content per unit and increased unit shipments in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal first quarter, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 13% sequentially, and down 10% year-over-year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sequential increase. Sequentially, flash ASPs decreased 10% on a blended basis, and 4% on a like-for-like basis. We shipped a record amount of flash bits in the quarter with shipments increasing 26%, sequentially and 49% year-over-year. HDD revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 5%, and average price per unit increased 13% to $112. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 42% and average price per unit decreased 10%. Moving to gross margin and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 4.1%, which was at the higher end of the guidance range provided in July, and included $225 million in underutilization expenses and $9 million in other one-time charges. In total, these charges represented an 8.5 percentage point headwind to gross margin. Flash gross margin was negative 10.3%. Underutilization charges due to reduced manufacturing volumes were $142 million and flash inventory write-downs were $9 million, resulting in a combined 9.7 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 22.9%. Underutilization charges were higher-than-expected at $83 million or a 7 percentage point headwind to gross margin. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were down 19% year-over-year to $555 million, well below our guidance range. Operating loss was $443 million, which included underutilization charges and inventory write-downs totaling $234 million. Income tax expense in the fiscal first quarter was $25 million. Net loss per share was $1.76, inclusive of a $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was an outflow of $626 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $544 million. Free cash flow included a payment of $523 million for the IRS settlement and $191 million cash receipt from the sale and lease back of our facility in Milpitas, California. Inventory declined $201 million sequentially to $3.5 billion. Days of inventory declined 10 days to 120 days. Flash inventory declined by nearly $400 million, driven by record bit shipments in the quarter and proactive actions taken to reduce wafer starts. Days of inventory for flash have reached the lowest level in nearly four years. HDD inventory grew by nearly $200 million, due to the timing of certain purchases and lower-than-expected shipments. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment, including the proceeds from our sale lease back of our Milpitas facility, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a net cash inflow of $82 million. In the fiscal first quarter, we fully drew the $600 million delayed-draft term loan facility. Gross debt outstanding was $7.7 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. For fiscal second quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be led by higher nearline HDD shipments and improved pricing in flash. We continue to adjust production into the second quarter to better align supply with demand and anticipate lower underutilization charges in both flash and HDD. For our fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 10% and 12%, which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD, totaling $110 million to $130 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $560 million and $580 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal second quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect a loss per share of $1.35 to $1.05, assuming approximately 325 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. We are now emerging from a historic storage cyclical downturn, where all of the changes made in the past several years were evident in how well each business performed relative to peers. The first quarter of fiscal ‘24 builds upon the improvements we made in fiscal year ‘23 around discipline, supply, and capital expenditure management, while executing on our product innovation roadmap. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses and are closely monitoring demand in our end markets to appropriately manage our inventory in both flash and HDD, all to improve sequential and year-over-year upside in our results. Moving forward, as we progress through fiscal year ‘24, we see an improving market environment in both businesses. With an improved position, the separation of the company unlocks value by creating two independent public companies with market-specific strategic focus. Better positions each franchise to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on unique growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions, and operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures. Okay, Peter, let's open up for Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. And congratulations on the decision here. Can you talk through a little bit anything preliminary in terms of how the OpEx might be a portion between the two businesses and you mentioned, you know, maybe you'll give us the capital structure at a later date, but just anything early on, unlike, you know, what you think the right amount of debt is to apportion to the two businesses?
Wissam Jabre: Hey, Joe, good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, it's a little bit too premature to talk about details with respect to each side of the business or each company as we get closer to the separation will be in a better position to talk about much more details with respect to OpEx apportionment, as well as capital structures, leverage targets, and capital return policies, et cetera.
David Goeckeler: Hey Joe, this is David. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you this morning. One thing I will say is we're very happy with the level of efficiency we've driven into the business over the last year, especially during this downturn, and we think has put us in a very good position to go through this transaction. I think OpEx over two years is down, over the last two years is down over $200 million. So we put ourselves in a position where we've got very efficient business and some flexibility to go through a transaction like this. So as Wissam said, we'll have more to say as we get closer.
Joe Moore: Okay. And then I wonder if I could just ask more tactically in terms of the need to pay down the convert early next year, how you're thinking about that and whether this, you know, the strategic change here changes anything in terms of your ability to do convert issuance or things like that, pay that down?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, Joe, the current announcement does not affect our ability to address the convert. As we've said before, our plan is to address the convert that's maturing in Feb ‘24 by the end of this calendar year.
Joe Moore: Okay, thank you very much.
Wissam Jabre: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Two, if I can as well, real quick. I guess the first question is just thinking about the separation, appreciating that you're not going to give anything at this point around the capital structure. I'm just curious though, the relationship with Kioxia, you know, I know in the past there's been certain attributes of rights as part of the JV. Any kind of context about the dialogue, you know, moving to the separation as it relates to that JV rights or, you know, should we be thinking about any approval processes that are involved in that?
David Goeckeler: No. So first off, the relationship with Kioxia is outstanding and it has been for a very, very long time so we expect that to continue on absolutely it's a -- provides a tremendous foundation for our NAND business with both very capital efficient NAND and a tremendous roadmap as we're going into BiCS8 here. But we can execute this transaction without any other approvals.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, and then as a quick follow up, I'm just curious on the hard disk drive business. I know the cloud revenue and total is down consistently, again, quarter-over-quarter. Just how would you characterize what you're seeing from a nearline perspective from the cloud? Have you started to see demand pull again? Just any kind of context of how you're thinking about, you know, the shaping of kind of a recovery here as we move forward?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we think this past quarter was the bottom, Aaron, and we see improving demand as we move throughout the fiscal year on a quarter-over-quarter basis. You know, we've had certain customers that have been on the sidelines for a while, and they're starting to come back and give us visibility into ordering. So we expect the market to recover from here going forward.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them too. First one, again, sorry to harp on the separation, it makes a lot of sense. I'm just kind of curious. In the past, David, you've spoken about some of the synergies in R&D and how the HDD product line uses some of the bomb from OptiNAND et cetera. I'm just kind of curious, would that change post the separation, or there's going to be no strategic shift on that, and then I had a follow-up?
David Goeckeler: So there's no, the separation doesn't imply any change in strategy for either business. So both of them will continue to go forward. No change in our product roadmaps. We feel very good about what's been built over the last three, four years. We feel like we're in a market-leading position in both franchises, both from a product point of view, if you look at what's happened in the hard drive business, you know, it's very, very clear now the adoption of SMR is the next big step in the cloud data center and that's progressing very well. Our 26-T drive just became the highest shipping drive in the quarter. And we, you know, we announced the next generation that with the 28-T, as well so no change there, you know, OptiNAND still a big part of that architecture and the team will be able to procure that and continue to drive that part of the strategy. And on the flash side of the business, the portfolio is also in great shape with both for product strategy and also the branding strategy. SanDisk, WD Black, these brands continue to perform extremely well. So we think it's a great setup for both businesses going forward.
Krish Sankar: Got it, thanks for that David. Another quick follow-up, your peers spoke about the HAMR Technology getting like adopted next year, and your road map shows EPMR to extending to 32 plus terabyte,. I'm kind of curious how you think about HAMR and your road map in case they'll catch up with C8?
David Goeckeler: Well, look we put a lot of optionality in our roadmap a number of years ago, so that we could extend the capacity points with things like OptiNAND, SMR, Ultra-SMR, EPMR, so that strategy is working very, very well. We're leading the industry in capacity points. We expect to be able to drive this strategy into the 40 terabyte range on our drives. HAMR is in development, it's going well, and we'll be able to fold that into our roadmap at the appropriate time. But for now, we've got a great roadmap, we've got a market-leading roadmap, we're leading the adoption of SMR into the cloud data center and we expect, you know, we have many more generations to go on our current roadmap and then we'll move to HAMR at the appropriate time when it's mature and we can build it at scale and it'll be the next leg of growth into the future.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, David.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Krish.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi, yes, thank you so much. Good morning. Back to the transaction, I guess, can you maybe talk a little bit about all the actions that you have taken that might be preventing some of the dissynergies that typically occur in terms of standard costs when there is separation of the business? Can you maybe A, address that? And B, on your comments on the roadmap, Ultra-SMR, EPMR, you have a lot of options. You've noted scaling up to 40 TV. Can you just talk about what the cost of that, how that would compare to, you know, your own future HAMR roadmap and give us some sense of how cost competitive you think these products would be? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Okay. So, on the first one, yes, I mean, Wamsi, I think you kind of laid it out there. We've been going through a whole series of actions that have set us up for this announcement. You know, it was really about execute the business better and give ourselves as much strategic optionality as possible. So as I talked about in the prepared remarks we've, you know, we separated ourselves in the business units on the product side that allows us to really get very focused on the portfolio and all the OpEx we spend on building our products, make sure we get the best return for it. I think that's worked out well. We then did the same thing in operations. We've now divided those organizations around HDD and flash. So we’ve -- and then we've optimized, taken out cost everywhere we can so that we can operate them independently and also have just the most efficient business possible. As I said, we've focused on our balance sheet. So I think we've put ourselves in a very good position where we can go through this separation and the organization is as prepared as we possibly can be for it. We've also, as I said earlier, we've taken a lot of OpEx out of the business. So we've driven the OpEx down to a very efficient number. So we believe we can go through the separation and end up with two very well-structured companies that can execute very well. And they come out of the gate with market-leading portfolios on each side and into a recovering market. So we feel good about that. Cost of the portfolio look I mean as you continue we feel the roadmap we have in place, you know, we can produce ultra-SMR, EPMR, OptiNAND drives very high scale, very quickly, very high yields on all the products. So we think the cost position is very advantageous. You see that in our results, you know, so you know when HAMR comes will fold that in and you know we want to get to the point where we have the same level of yields we have the same level of confidence as we do something like a 26-T drive that we just launched and now it's the, you know, nearly half of our exabytes, a quarter or two in. And that's how we think about launching new products. So you know, when we get there, I think that we'll have that same kind of cost structure on HAMR, and we have a great, very, very strong position to drive very efficient, very high scale, very quickly, new drives for many generations on the technology that we've put in place over the last three or four years.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks, Dave.
David Goeckeler: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. Congrats on the announcement today. Understanding you have amended the debt covenants back in June, given the announced transaction, how are you thinking about the covenants over the next few quarters, specifically with the free cash flow before the transaction is closed? And does that limit the amount of CapEx you could spend in the meantime? And I'll follow up.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Good morning, Sidney. Thanks for the question. The current announcement does not affect the amended credit agreements. And so from a free cash flow, from a governance perspective, we're comfortable that we can operate effectively. We have ample liquidity. We do have ample operational flexibility to operate, so I don't see the current announcement as impacting us in any way.
Sidney Ho: Okay. My follow-up is, if you look at the fiscal second quarter guidance, if you can walk us through your assumptions that drive 7 points of increase in gross margin, that would be great. It looks like under your utilization charges coming down, are there benefits from sales of previously written down inventory? And what are you expecting in terms of price increases in both flash and hard disk drive on a like-for-like basis. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Okay, maybe I'll start a little bit on the cost side and then David could chime in on the top line side. Look, the -- when -- one of the bigger, obviously, levers is the underutilization. We did in Q1, around $225 million. In total, we had around $234 million to 235 million of other charges. And our guide has a underutilization at a much lower level, and so that's one element. In addition, obviously, we continue to focus on cost reduction. We do have still, we're still, if you exclude the underutilization aspect, we're still taking cost out of the system on both the flash side and the HDD side. And so that's a key lever to improve the gross margin. And then if I take it back up to the top line, we see obviously improvement on the revenue side and the improvement is coming from both sides of the house on both businesses. So that also contributes quite well with respect to the gross margin and within that revenue also we do have a bit of a mix that's helping us as well.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Sidney, I guess, what I would add is, if you look at the HDD business, we're ramping new products, right? The 26-T drive is ramping rapidly. And we also have an improving pricing environment in drives, which is a nice tailwind. And then in flash, we have an improving pricing environment as well, as Wissam said, a better mix. And we expect that business to inflect a positive gross margin next quarter, which is a great milestone for us as we continue the recovery of the business.
Sidney Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Tom O'Malley: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on your expectations for both market demand on the NAND exabyte side for fiscal year ‘24, as well as your view of supply. I mean, you're starting the year up almost 50% year-over-year, obviously off a very low base and sequentially up mid-20s. Some of your peers have talked about really demand here to begin the fiscal year or to begin the recovery in those -- for those other guys, but kind of some slowing as guys saw the bottom ordered a bunch and then have kind of slowed down. Could you just give me your comments on if you're seeing any of that and then your expectations for the exabyte shipments for you for the fiscal year?
David Goeckeler: Yes, so, you know, we have seen an acceleration here at the end of ‘23. We've raised our demand number quite a bit into the mid-teens for ’23, we'll get to ‘24. You know, some of that, you know, there has been some strategic buys as part of that. I know that's been a big discussion in the industry, but we’d also just see the markets returning to normal inventory levels. So for us, that's been more of what's been happening and a good mix across the businesses. For ‘24 we see high-teens, kind of, demand and we continue to see production significantly below that.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful, and then on the other side of the business, you talked about the, kind of, you know, varied inventory positions you have, flash going down, HDD actually going up a bit. And if you compare your results with Seagate, at least for the last couple of quarters, results have been relatively similar. Could you just talk about when we should start to see that divergence, just given the fact that you're addressing a higher capacity point in the market today, and theoretically you should see some outside benefit. When do you think you'll start to see that divergence in the market? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Divergence in what aspect, Tom?
Tom O'Malley: In terms of revenue difference.
Wissam Jabre: So we're managing the business for profitability on HDD. I mean, I think it's, you know, we and I think we are driving a more profitable business. So that, that's the way we think about the business and driving back to our model, which we expect to get back to here over the next several quarters. Jamie?
Operator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Srini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. Good morning, guys. David, on the HDD comments that you see growth throughout the fiscal year, just looking for some additional color, just kind of listening to some of your customers and the big hyperscalers. I think the CapEx comments have been fairly mixed and I'm just curious as to how broad-based this recovery that you're seeing is. Is it primarily driven by the inventory work-downs or anything else that's driving it? And also, if you can comment on by geography, I think, you said China was weak in the quarter, if you could talk about how -- what’s your expectation for China business is going forward?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I think you got it there in your question. I think you have more broad-based participation in the market by the big hyperscalers as they get to the end of their inventory corrections. So that's been part of it. Remember, we're coming off very, very, very low numbers. So we expect improvement throughout the year by more people participating in the market and more consistent participation by the ones that have been in it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. China has been -- it’s been better, but not -- it hasn't recovered as fast as we expected, so it's still a little bit lumpy and weaker than we would like. So the smart video market has been pretty consistent and we've seen some good results there. But in the cloud space, it still has a little ways to go.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. And then a cash flow question for Wissam. I guess, I'm just curious, you had an IRS payment due during the quarter. Did you make that payment? I see like a $300 million impact from the tax. And then if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes in terms of free cash flow for next quarter, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, sure. So on the tax payment, in Q1 we made a $523 million payment with respect to the IRS settlement. This covers the years 2008 through 2012. And so this is why you see when you look at our free cash flow that we reported for fiscal Q1 at a negative $544 million, in that we had that $523 million payment. On the -- it was partially offset by the sale and lease back of the Milpitas facilities of around $191 million. So all in all, we're around the negative $200 million for the quarter. As we look forward, obviously, the key is the continuous improvement of the profitability and of the business, working capital management. You've seen our transition on the inventory side, for instance, in Q1. We continue to manage inventory very, very closely on both flash and HDD. So I expect that inventory to continue to decline gradually in this coming quarter and the next. And then the continued focus on CapEx for the fiscal year. Would it say that for fiscal ‘24 we expect our cash CapEx to be significantly lower than fiscal 2023. So, you know, free cash flow is, and cash flow is very important to us, big focus, and we'll continue to focus on it. And as we look into the second-half of fiscal ‘24, we're projecting to be cash flow positive on a quarterly basis in the second-half of this fiscal year.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. Good morning.
David Goeckeler: Good morning, Karl.
Karl Ackerman: Hey, good morning. When do you anticipate NAND underutilization charges to abate? And then second, you indicated that NAND and HDD bit shipments will recover in December. I guess for NAND, will that be primarily tied to consumer applications, or do you expect enterprise to be the larger driver over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I'll take the second part of that, and Wissam can comment on the underutilization charges. Look, we expect bits to be up slightly in the December quarter. It's a strong consumer quarter for us, although we don't really break out by mix. But I mean, I think that's one way to think about it. We expect an improving price environment and bits to be slightly up.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, and with respect to underutilization, Karl, we do manage our supply very dynamically. And so we guided this quarter based on what we see today. We do expect underutilization to continue in the third fiscal quarter, maybe a little bit lower than here, but it's a bit too early to cover the quarters beyond the next one.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Actually the next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go with your question.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. David, at the bottom of slide four, you did say that the board remains open to considering other alternatives should they become available. So since you put that in the presentation, can you talk about what other options could be available? Is this a reference to the collapse of the JV that Hynix commented about or was asked about on its call? Is this in reference to an outright sale of the NAND business? Can you just talk about that a little more?
David Goeckeler: No, it's not in reference to any particular thing. It just says that we think this is the best next step for the business to unlock value. We think that, you know, we put the business in a position to go through this right now. It's all the reasons we talked about from the portfolio to where we are on efficiency point of view to where we are on the work we've done to retire debt. And also going into an improving market. But I think any company is always open to other strategic options should they become available and we'll consider them at that time. Although I do want to be very clear that the strategic review is completed and any conversations that were going on as a part of that have ended. And we're very excited about this step forward. We think it's the best next step for the business. But I think in any business, you're always going to be open. If there's other strategic options that become available, we will thoroughly consider those at the time.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. And then, Wissam, for you, so the underutilization charges of $120 million at the midpoint, how do they split for December? I would think that more of its now in the HDD business, but how does that split things?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, the split of the underage utilization is two-thirds flash and one-third HDD.
Timothy Arcuri: Great, thank you, Wissam.
Wissam Jabre: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question does come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. Just a quick question if you went to it already. When you look at the hard disk size, I'm wondering if you had, you know, what the exabyte growth was for the last two years and what you're seeing as you look forward with this, seems like a little bit of a bounce coming through. What do you expect for fiscal ‘24, fiscal ‘25, or calendar ‘24, let's say, yes.
David Goeckeler: So yes, we, I mean, coming off such a high on ‘22, ‘23 will be down, but then we expect to get back to, we expect a consistent exabyte growth in this business in the mid to high-20 range on an ongoing basis.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And the same on the NAND side, with the spin-off, do you see any change in the technology roadmap? How do you see the 218 BiCS, next generation BiCS coming? And if you can also give us your expectation on NAND bit growth for ‘23 and ‘24?
David Goeckeler: Yes, no, we don't expect any change in the technology roadmap. The JV is very strong, very solid, very productive. Teams work together on a day-by-day basis. We've talked a lot about that. We're very happy with where it's at. The relationship is very strong. The technology roadmap, we think, as we talked about last time with BiCS8 and wafer bonding, we've made a huge step forward there. You know, we've always been able to produce NAND at a better capital intensity than the rest of the industry. Our measures over the last several years are up to a third less capital intensity for the business. So the JV has been strong for ‘23 plus years and we expect it to be strong for very, very far into the future. So we feel very good about that.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Any thoughts on the bit growth I guess for ‘24 and as the next generation, as the next bit stage starts to ramp I guess? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes, we expect demand in ‘24 in the NAND business to be high-teens, you know, and if it gets really strong maybe it'll creep over the 20s and low-20s, but we're thinking about those high teens numbers. And like I said, production will be significantly below that.
Vijay Rakesh: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good morning. Congratulations…
David Goeckeler: Good morning, Harlan.
Harlan Sur: …on the strategic. Yes, congratulations on the strategic actions announced today. On the flash technology side, the JV brings strong synergies in flash manufacturing development and manufacturing scale. Excluding the underutilization charges, you guys have been driving down the underlying cost per bit at around a mid-teens type CAGR and in line with your prior targets and that's even with the rising capital intensity, right? As you look ahead, BiCS6 transition moved to bonded architecture on BiCS8. Does the team believe it can sustain its mid-teens cost down profile?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we do. We feel very good about that. I mean, I've spoken about this in the past. It's an explicit goal of the technology team to continue to drive those cost downs and we feel good about our ability to do that. It's been one of the strengths of the JV and the JV technology team for a very long time.
Harlan Sur: Well, thank you for that. And then on the flash portfolio side within SSD, particularly the team has been in a very, very strong number two market share position in client SSD, very strong portfolio. In enterprise and cloud, however, you've been consistently in the sort of number five, number six global market share position. So as you think about spinning out the flash business, what is the team doing to improve its competitiveness in its enterprise and cloud SSD portfolio?
David Goeckeler: Well, we like the portfolio we have. We qualified our NVMe based enterprise SSD at multiple cloud providers. And unfortunately, we qualified right into a significant downturn in cloud consumption of enterprise SSDs. So as that starts to come back over the next several quarters and as we go through ‘24, we expect our position to improve as those vendors start consuming again. I mean, the reality is there's just not a lot of buying in that market going on right now.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead with your question.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. David, I just want to go back to your comment just made regarding enterprise SSD. When I look at the slides from the results of a strategic review, you're highlighting strengthening client SSD and also retail. But I don't see any mention of enterprise SSD. How should I reconcile that with the comment you just made?
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean, it's because those are two very, very strong strengths of the portfolio. I think they're very unique. Look, our retail franchise is a real gem. I mean, it's a big part of the portfolio. It provides better through cycle profitability. We've done a lot of work on building brands over the last several years. I mean, we've already had very, very strong brands in SanDisk. I think everybody knows SanDisk is the premier brand in the industry. We've built the BLACK brand around gaming now. That's a significant part of the portfolio. I think we're the preferred provider in gaming. We talked about it this quarter, where 50% year-over-year content increases in devices and doubling the number of bits in that. So it's been, you know, it's a very, very key part of the portfolio. We look forward to highlighting it more. The client portfolio has always been a strength of the business. It's something that's been built over the last several years. We've driven several innovations in that, like the DRAM-less client SSD. That's always been a very strong part of the portfolio. I guess, you know, Mehdi, we could have put a whole bunch of stuff on the slide that we're proud of in the portfolio, but we picked the strongest ones. But we're very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. It's just a market that's depressed right now. We talked a lot about that last year. We had qualifications at multiple hyperscalers. Those products are still active. We're migrating them forward to future nodes and we expect those to ramp as that market recovers.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, great. And just a question, a follow-up question for Wissam, and I'm not asking you for a guide on 2024, but if I just look at your cost decline, if I just assume 10% the cost decline and assume the current ASP trend, your NAND flash business should become profitable maybe by mid-year or sooner than later. The trajectory is very supportive of reaching profitability in the next couple of quarters. Is that a fair assumption?
Wissam Jabre: Well, look, what -- in the current guide for this quarter, it does imply that NAND should be gross margin positive. And in terms of the outer quarters, it's a little bit too early for us to comment on them.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Mehdi.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the announcement.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari: Yes, Dave. So, on the NAND side, I think based on a response to a prior question. It looks like you're assuming underutilization charges declined by about $60 million from September to December. Are you guys taking up wafer starts, or what's driving the sequential decline in charges in NAND?
David Goeckeler: Yeah, I guess what I -- Wissam will comment a little bit as well, but I guess what I would say Toshiya is we're, you know, we're not putting a broad statement out there about that. What we're doing is just being very dynamic with how we manage wafer start so that we can keep supply and demand matched as best we can without letting inventory get up too high. So as you saw, I mean, our NAND inventory is at the best level since I've been here in the company. I mean, Wissam's team has done a great, and the operations team just done an unbelievable job of managing that. So we'll stay very close to where our markets are and how we're seeing demand, and then we'll adjust wafer starts appropriately.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, thanks, Dave. The only thing I would add, Toshiya, is that when you think of underutilization just I know there was an earlier question on this. Yes, we do expect underutilization further in the second-half of fiscal year. The way to think of it as we were expecting underutilization to be slightly lower from these levels in the third fiscal quarter. And as David said, this is very dynamic. We continue to manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. And so obviously, depending on business conditions, this could still change.
Toshiya Hari: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, David, you talked about value-based pricing on the hard disk drive side and how that's driving better gross margins into the December quarter. Can you speak to any kind of specific end markets where you're seeing traction? Is it mostly client and consumer? Are you able to push through some price increases in the cloud segment as well? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: I think it's, so first of all on the channel, we're seeing good response to value-based pricing. And then as we bring out new products, you know, as I said in the past, I think innovation is what the first part of value-based pricing is bringing a better value proposition to our customers. And as we continue to bring out unique products 26 terabyte ultra-SMR ramped very fast, nearly half of our nearline exabytes this quarter, and we're now bringing out 28. And I think as we continue to do that, we'll have the opportunity to have a better conversation with our customers, because we're bringing more value to them. So I would say it's, we're looking at it across all of our markets.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: All right. Hey, thank you, Toshiya. We appreciate that. All right, everybody, we appreciate the time today. Thanks for the discussion, and we look forward to talking to you as we progress throughout the quarter.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-07-31 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analyst and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, spending and cost reductions, business plans and performance, market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and/or our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. Western Digital's fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded expectations as our access to broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to capture demand upsides in both client and consumer end-markets, reaffirming our strength in a challenging market environment. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Before diving into the specifics of the quarter and the full fiscal year, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments in fiscal year 2023. Importantly, we continued to optimize our operations and successfully executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability when demand rebounds across hard drives and flash. Throughout the fiscal year, we were focused on enhancing our product leadership and reinforcing our business agility. In HDD, we have successfully qualified our latest family of capacity enterprise hard drives that all major customers and are shipping our 26-terabyte Ultra SMR drive in high volume. In Flash, we pioneered the use of wafer bonding and advanced 3D NAND manufacturing and introduced the groundbreaking technology in BiCS8, which sets the foundation for future 3D NAND scaling. On the expense front, we streamlined investments across our HDD and Flash portfolio, which enabled us to significantly reduce quarterly operating expense, while continuing to deliver innovative products and technologies that address customers’ growing storage needs. Further, we have reduced our cash capital expenditure run rate by over 50% in the fiscal second-half and consolidated our hard drive manufacturing footprint. These efforts enabled Western Digital to preserve capital, while effectively executing on product strategies and aligning our supply with post-pandemic demand environment. Notably, we reduced our inventory by nearly $300 million sequentially and exited fiscal year 2023 at a much healthier level than a few quarters ago. And in June, we successfully completed amendments to our credit agreements, which provide Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility as we navigate macro dynamics. In summary, we continue to proactively take action to bolster our agility, enhance our liquidity position, optimize our inventory levels across HDD and Flash, and strengthened our position as an industry and market leader. We exited fiscal year 2023 well-positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and capture long-term growth opportunities in data storage, spanning from client to edge to cloud. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the strategic review is ongoing. We continue to make progress on this process and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Turning to the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue in both client and consumer end-markets returned to sequential growth led by normalized end-market demand and higher average capacity per unit in Flash. In consumer, retail flash exceeded our expectations across all major product categories. We saw similar results in client with upside in both HDD and Flash and across almost all major product categories, including client SSD, gaming console, embedded flash and client hard drives. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remained subdued. I'll now turn to a business update, starting with HDD. In the fiscal fourth quarter, ongoing cloud weakness drove the overall decline in HDD revenue. However, demand for both client and consumer hard drives has stabilized and exceeded our expectations. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have successfully qualified all variance of our 22 terabyte CMR and 26 terabyte Ultra SMR hard drive platforms at all major cloud customers, setting the stage to improve shipments and profitability. In addition, we are about to begin product sampling of our 28 terabyte Ultra SMR drive. This cutting-edge product is built upon the success of our ePMR and Ultra SMR technologies with features and reliability trusted by our customers worldwide. We are staging this product for quick qualification and ramp as demand improves. Turning to Flash, revenue increased sequentially led by growth in both client and consumer flash bit shipments, which exceeded our expectations with total bit shipments returning to year-over-year growth. The stronger-than-expected bit growth is attributable to normalizing PC and consumer demand, as well as content growth. Average capacity per consumer and client SSD increased over 40% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. Moving to technology developments, we continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 based on a chip, bonded to array architecture. BiCS8 solidifies Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost capital efficiency and I/O performance into the future. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspective on our outlook. In HDD, as we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect overall demand to remain stable. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both improving demand and new product ramps to drive growth in revenue and profitability. In Flash, we are encouraged by several indicators signaling improving market dynamics. Notably, our two largest end markets, client and consumer are returning to growth, inventories are normalizing, content per unit is increasing and price declines have been moderating. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, down 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Looking at end markets for the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 37% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 18% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to a decrease in capacity enterprise drive shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 59 exabytes, down 26% sequentially, driven by ongoing weakness at cloud customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in both hard drive and flash product shipments. Client represented 39% of total revenue at $1 billion, up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by growth in bit shipments for gaming consoles. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in flash pricing and lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Consumer represented 24% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 19% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher retail SSD shipments. The year-over-year decrease was driven by price declines in flash and lower retail hard drive shipments. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12.3 billion, down 34% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 17.2 percentage points to 15.7%, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 21.8 percentage points to negative 4.8%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $3.59. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2023, cloud revenue decreased 34% year-over-year, primarily due to reduced shipments of capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs. Client revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in flash pricing, as well as lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 26% for the year as growth in retail SSD bit shipments was more than offset by broad-based flash price decline and lower consumer hard drive shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, HDD revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 18% and average price per unit decreased 9% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, HDD exabyte shipments decreased 38% and average price per unit decreased 17%. Flash revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 43% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 6% on a blended basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 15% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 3.9%, down 6.7 percentage points sequentially and 28.4 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $272 million in costs or 10.2 percentage points for manufacturing underutilization, flash inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 3.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.5 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower capacity enterprise volume, as well as higher underutilization-related charges. Underutilization charges were $76 million, or 5.9 percentage points. Flash gross margin was negative 11.9%, down 6.9 percentage points sequentially and 47.8 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges due to the reduced manufacturing volumes were $135 million, and inventory write-downs were $27 million, resulting in 11.8 percentage point reduction. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses of $582 million for the quarter, down $20 million sequentially and $178 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $478 million, driven mainly by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling $272 million. Income tax expense was $57 million for fiscal fourth quarter and $237 million for fiscal year 2023. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal fourth quarter loss per share was $1.98, inclusive of $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $68 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $219 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, planning and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement were $151 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal fourth quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth-quarter as defined in our credit agreement, was $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 4.5 times, compared to 2.8 times in the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, the credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation add back associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in the cash-flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we executed an amendment to our credit agreements. These amendments include modifications to the leverage ratio requirements applicable through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which provide additional financial flexibility in the near-term. We also extended the commitment under the delayed-draw term-loan agreement to August 14th, 2023. Please refer to our earnings presentation for details. At the end-of-the quarter, total liquidity was $4.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion, and an unused delayed draw term-loan facility of $600 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll discuss our business outlook. For fiscal first quarter, sequentially, we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be relatively stable. In fiscal first quarter, we are continuing to adjust production to better match demand and anticipate underutilization charges to impact both HDD and Flash gross margins along with product mix pressures on Flash ASP. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both HDD and Flash revenue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2024, driven by normalizing demand in storage, as well as higher average content per unit in Flash. Gross margin is expected to gradually improve driven by higher HDD volume and lower underutilization charges in both Flash and HDD. We will continue to tightly manage our cost structure and expenses as we navigate the challenging environment. For fiscal year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to decline significantly. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.75 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 2.5% and 4.5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $200 million to $220 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $570 million to $590 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal first quarter and $130 million to $170 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the loss per share of $1.80 to $2.10, assuming approximately 323 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up. Fiscal year 2023 marked a period of exceptional progress and strategic planning for Western Digital. We diligently optimized our operations and executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability as demand inevitably rebounds across hard drives and flash. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities and deliver continued success. Before opening up for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to recognize Siva Sivaram, our esteemed President of Technology and Strategy. Siva will be leaving Western Digital to pursue a great leadership opportunity in a different technology domain. Siva has made significant contributions to Western Digital and SanDisk over the past 10-years and he is a wonderful friend. We wish him all the best going forward. Peter, let's start the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to NAND in the current quarter looks like the underutilization charges are similar. Does that mean your utilization is unchanged? And I guess it seems like you're able to make some inventory progress. Does that mean that you can at some point have a line-of-sight to bring that back up?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. NAND in the current quarter, as we said, we saw a good, I guess good market reaction in consumer and in the client business, both returned to growth on an exabyte basis. They both were sequential grower, so we saw incremental upside there, so we were happy about that. We are still underutilizing the fab. I'll let Wissam talk about that in a little bit more detail. We do plan to underutilize for another couple of quarters, but we feel good about the overall -- the signs in the overall market, price declines are moderating, our inventory is down, bit shipments are up and we expect bit shipments to be up again double-digits next quarter. So not quite where we want to be yet, but the market is stabilizing and we see a lot of good things -- a lot of metrics going in the right direction.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, Joe. And with respect to underutilization, we saw similar type of underutilization charges in fiscal Q4 versus Q3. For the Flash side, and when you look at HDD, we had a bit of more underutilization. But sticking with the Flash, also in our guidance, we've noted similar levels into fiscal Q1. Albeit, if you look at, sort of, the range of $200 million to $220 million, I would say it is split 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And also we're -- if I think of, let's say, the fiscal Q2, I anticipate more or less similar levels of underutilization from where we stand today.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. And if I could ask the follow-up. In terms of the uses of cash in the next few quarters, I know you've got the convert that comes due early next year. I think there's still some issues about a potential tax payment. Can you just update us there and sort of do you need to raise money to pay those out?
Wissam Jabre: So with respect to uses of cash, as you noted, we do have the convert that matures in February ‘24, and we plan to address that this quarter or the next one. We also have the IRS settlement that is coming up and we expect also this payment to be very likely this quarter. But with respect to liquidity, exiting fiscal Q4, we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity. And so if you recall the delayed-draw term loan was put in place in the event we need to address the IRS settlement. So that will be drawn down to take care of the IRS settlement when it happens. And with respect to the convert, I mentioned we'd address it in the coming two quarters.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Wissam Jabre: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. [Technical Difficulty] Good question, I guess this question [Technical Difficulty] supply perspective, we haven't seen any [Technical Difficulty] realization aggressively as we've seen. So how would you think about the current impact of supply-demand normalization in the next six, nine, 12-months?
David Goeckeler: Okay. Hey, C.J., right? C.J., that was very -- it was a little tough to hear you there, but I think we got the gist of the question, which was supply demand normalization. Is that right in Flash?
C.J. Muse: Yes. Sorry about that. Yes.
David Goeckeler: No, that's right. Okay. So look, I think as I said, there are a number of things we saw in the market. This quarter we saw sequential bit growth overall, we saw clients and consumer returning to exabyte growth on a year-over-year basis, with consumer SSD content up 40%, client SSD up 20%. We saw our inventory down. We think in the client -- in the consumer and client markets, PC markets basically shipping to demand at this point. We expect our -- for the fiscal year, we saw our bits about flat year-over-year. For the calendar year, we see them down low-single-digits. We probably see the industry down a little lower than that. So we're taking the actions to bring supply and demand better into balance, and I think we're seeing that across our markets. Cloud is still -- there's still a couple of quarters ago, there that's a larger story, but in our two biggest markets for Flash, we're seeing that supply-demand balance start to move closer together, put it that way.
C.J. Muse: Thank you. And my second question. [Technical Difficulty] you announced [Technical Difficulty] I think there was a hope that maybe -- there might be some underlying deposits underneath that thing [Technical Difficulty] How should we be thinking about training and hearing about [Technical Difficulty]
David Goeckeler: Okay. I think that was the strategic review and timing, C.J. So as the process is active, we look forward to talking more about it when we reach a conclusion.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you, guys. This is [Michael] (ph) on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, how are you guys thinking with the recent uptick in AI investment in the data center? How do you think that impacts the mix of Flash relative to HDD capacity being deployed, or maybe how that would impact you going forward? And then kind of related to that, how -- are you guys -- can you guys just give us an update on where you stand with your enterprise SSD qualifications? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I've been thinking a lot about generative AI. It's clearly a big topic these days and obviously, a lot of spend going on to build out the infrastructure in the cloud, which I think, quite frankly, is a great thing. The cloud distribution model of new technology is something that is pretty amazing. That's been built out over the last decade, so we all get access to this technology very rapidly. And when I think about this in the storage domain, clearly, the compute infrastructure is being built out now, but what we're all going to be enabled with there are like incredible tools to automate data creation at many different levels, whether it's text data, video data. Whatever it happens to be, I think that we're essentially going to really accelerate our ability all of us to create information that needs to be stored. So I see this is kind of a catalyst for just a profound increase in the amount of data creation. I think that once those tools get distributed and we all start using them, I think that drives incremental growth across SSDs and hard drives. I mean hard drives are the foundational storage in the cloud. It's going to be that way for a very long-time. So while Gen AI may have some disruptions on the business in the near-term, as the compute infrastructure gets built out, very optimistic that this is a - as I said, I think it's a profound -- it's a catalyst for a profound increase in the rate of data creation. So quite excited about that. We don't know exactly what -- how you model that just yet, except that there is new innovation drives new data creation, which drives the need for storage. So we look forward as these -- as this infrastructure gets built out and rapidly adopted, the impact it's going to have on our business. Now on enterprise SSD, we still have the qualifications. We've recently qualified BiCS5 in some of these places. That market along with nearline HDD or capacity enterprise HDD is depressed right now or subdued. So we're not seeing a lot of growth in that. But we fully expect that when that market comes back and that part of cloud in structured spending comes back that we'll be in a good position. We're still investing in the products and feel good about the position we have with the major cloud vendors.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tom O'Malley: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I just -- I wanted to narrow in on the HDD side. There's been a variance of timing of recovery across the industry. Could you just give us your latest -- on when you think the cloud portion of your HDD business is going to recover? I know you previously have said the fourth quarter, has there been any push out in that expectation? And could you also just comment on the health? I know it's down this quarter, but just the health of that HDD business as you're seeing it today. So just the timing of the recovery and how it's been today?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I think as we moved, you know, so first of all, we think we're going to see sequential exabyte growth in capacity enterprise HDD throughout the fiscal year, but it's going to be towards the end of the year, end of the first quarter where we start to get line of sight to all of the customers coming back. I think we're having discussions across all of our customers about what they're -- we always have conversations, but some of the big ones have been in inventory digestion for quite a while. So we're getting better line of sight to the end of that. But I think we still have a couple of quarters to go, but improving I think next quarter things will be stable. It will be a bit of mix impact there. We expect client to be a little bit more challenged in this quarter. But I think as we move throughout the year, things will get better. And I think your timing of a couple more quarters of getting through phase and as we get into early next year, we expect things to look better.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful. And then also in the HDD business, your competitor, kind of, talked about being more aggressive in certain areas on pricing. Have you guys also looked to be more aggressive on pricing and any comments that you have on just your strategy with clients on the pricing side? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Pricing really starts with innovation. I mean, I think that's where we -- we're staging our 28 T Ultra SMR product. We're really happy with where Ultra SMR is at. EPMR opting in and we're already staging our next product for growth there. That's the underpinnings of where we're able to bring a better TCO proposition to our customers. And as we do that, we're able to share in the benefits of that as those drives gets deployed. The rest of the market is more market driven pricing. We have a lot of different channels, a lot of different markets we sell into. And that type of pricing is just is more of what you would typically think in any big market around supply and demand.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I told them personally with some Flash side [Technical Difficulty] and June was [Technical Difficulty]. Just so that the pricing should improve after or revenue should improve after December. Is that a function of overall NAND pricing getting better, or your specific exposure to retail and PCs above BU? And then I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: I missed the first part of the question…
Peter Andrew: Yes. Sorry. Sorry, Krish. Could you please repeat?
A – David Goeckeler: Sorry, Krish. You know, we never agreed. There was a little bit of static on the line.
Q – Krish Sankar: I apologize. I was just trying to figure out the pricing [Indiscernible] in June. We spoke about the revenue improvement. Is it a function of NAND pricing improving or just statistic [Indiscernible] your targeted retail and PC is going to get better?
David Goeckeler: Okay. I think I got it at that time. So NAND pricing, so first of all, in the last quarter, NAND price -- you saw like-for-like pricing down 9%, blended down 6%, so moderating from the quarter before. Next quarter, we expect volume to pick up, which will drive -- volume pick up margin to be impacted a little bit more from where it is today. So continue to moderate, but volume picking up. Does that help answer your question? I don't know. I didn't get all of your questions, Krish. so I'm sorry if I'm not answering it.
Krish Sankar: No, no. I think it does. It does. I was just trying to figure out the specific and verticals, which is PCs and retail.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I got you. So as we said, we saw the client and consumer markets return to growth -- exabyte growth and sequential revenue growth. So we see those markets have kind of through their inventory digestion and more shipping to end demand so that -- we expect that to continue as we go forward.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks David. And then a quick follow-up on hard drive. You said that you're sampling the 8-terabyte ePMR. Is the 32 terabyte ePMR still on your road map? And are you like doing that by increasing the number of disks per drive? And how do you think about the gross margin [Technical Difficulty] to terabyte?
David Goeckeler: Okay. So let me -- again. I think I got most of the questions. So we're not adding more disks I mean, Ultra SMR is -- it's a combination of our ePMR, OptiNAND and Ultra SMR technology. So the next step on the roadmap, I think we've talked a lot over the last year, plus about this driving from 20 to 30 plus with a set of technologies around ePMR, OptiNAND, Ultra SMR. And this is the next step in that roadmap. We still have a couple of more steps to go. So we'll announce the products one at a time, but we're happy with where we are and continue to drive innovation. And as demand comes back, we'll be ramping into a great set of products. And these are products that can be staged quickly and ramp in volumes very quickly, very established technology. And the 26-terabyte drive, Ultra SMR drive, we really -- that sold at scale this quarter and we expect a significant growth in that in the next quarter as well.
Krish Sankar: Awesome. Very good update. Very helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. So we've had a few head fakes on phone recovery on the cloud side, particularly in HDDs. And wondering as you think through, sort of, this improvement starting in fiscal 2Q, what's underpinning some of the confidence? You noted demand recovery. Are you seeing particular signs from customers that are pointing to that? And your primary competitor also noted taking some changes, including a build-to-order philosophy. Curious if you guys are contemplating any such changes. And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Wamsi. So first of all, yes, I mean, you hit it. I mean we have ongoing and very significant conversations with our customers on a -- many quarters out, so that's what gives us -- that's what underpins the view we have. To your point, things can change, but that's the current view and the conversations are productive and positive. On the build, the order comment, look, I think the industry is going to come out of -- well, let me speak about us. So Western Digital will come out of this downturn. It's a pretty severe downturn in a cyclical industry, but we've done a lot of things that I think the business is going to be different on the other side of this. So first of all, we've taken a significant amount of capacity out-of-the system. We've talked about the shifts from client to capacity enterprise, at least as long as I've been here and it's been going on for many, many years before that. I think that transition is going to be essentially done. There is a long tail on any technology, but if you look on a unit basis, we'll come out of this with significant less spending on our infrastructure. We'll have the lowest fixed-cost we've had in a decade-plus in our HDD infrastructure, and we'll really be focused exclusively on that client enterprise business going forward. That's not a -- we still have a client business. Don't get me wrong. It's still going to be there. Like I said, there's a long-tail of technology. But I think as part of that, the industry will come out and we will come out of this as more of a build-the-order, if you will, as opposed to a build to forecast. So that's why we're having these conversations with our customers because it is a it is a long build time on an HDD, and we want to make sure that we've got the infrastructure in place. We've got the components in place, and we're running the right process to deliver what our customers need at the right time. So I think that maybe the short answer to your question is yes, Western Digital will be -- is going to more of that kind of process.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Dave, and just a clarification on the underutilization charges, which look roughly flattish quarter-on-quarter. Are those charges roughly similar in flash and HDD this past quarter? Or are there different moving pieces underlying that for September?
Wissam Jabre: Sure, Wamsi. So when you look at the September quarter, the guide at $200 million to $220 million of underutilization charges and they're split roughly 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And I would -- just to clarify also to add with respect probably to the following quarter. I expect -- sorry, underutilization related charges to be let's say, 5% to 10% down and most of the -- if not all of the decrease would be coming from HDD.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you, Wissam.
Wissam Jabre: You’re welcome.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wamsi.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the cloud weakness again. I understand the cloud things could be lumpy. But curious about your conversations with the large hyperscale guys. How has that changed around a quarter ago? Are they giving you signals about when inventory will start stabilizing? Are they worried about supply in the second half given production cuts by all the suppliers? And are they more receptive to purchase commitments?
David Goeckeler: Yes. What I would say is the it's always a very robust conversation given the amount of business we do with the hyperscalers. It's clear that some of them have been in a very severe inventory digestion phase and kind of took a pause on buying anything, but we're back to having conversations with those customers. I mean, they're still growing. And storage is still being created and growing. So we expect those conversations in those businesses to the buying will reemerge and we're having the conversations on when that will happen and in what magnitude just to make sure that we've got all of our capacity aligned to deliver that. I think we're getting very good reception on the product road map. As we talked about our 22, 24, 26 terabyte platform and products have now been qualified by all of the major cloud vendors. We're just -- we expect to ramp those significantly, especially the 26 T next quarter. That's really becoming a major capacity point for some of the biggest cloud builders. And right on the back of that, we're launching a 28 T UltraSMR drive. So the conversations are strong, and it's about making sure we have clear alignment on what their requirements are going to be and that we get the proper manufacturing in place to deliver on that.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Hard Drive side. Clearly, you guys have been better than the competitor last quarter. But I just want to hone in on the SMR drives, which you said have qualified at all major cloud customers. Can you give us an idea what SMR adoption is today and where you think it will be in a few quarters from now? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: SMR, it's very idiosyncratic. I mean the intersection of adoption and inventory digestion makes it very lumpy. And if you look at the current quarter or last quarter, but I can say going forward that several of the major cloud providers are standardizing on an SMR deployment, UltraSMR for us, and we expect have a significant ramp of that technology over the next several quarters.
Sidney Ho: Okay, thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Sidney.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had one clarification and then a question. David, on NAND ASPs for the current quarter, I guess you talked about bids being up double digits sequentially, and you're kind of guiding revenue to flat sequentially. So I guess, the implied ASPs are down perhaps a little bit more than what they were down in the June quarter, but you talked about moderation. So is the sharper price decline in September that's implied in guidance or embedded in guidance, primarily a function of mix? Or am I missing something there?
David Goeckeler: Yes. It may be a little bit -- sequentially, maybe a little bit lower than what you're modeling. So I think that's where it is. Toshiya, we can follow up with you on kind of more details, but I think that's probably the clarification.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Got it. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Wissam. You mentioned that for fiscal '24, you plan to cut CapEx significantly. Curious if it's purely impacting your capacity decisions in NAND? Or are there any changes or shifts to how you think about the road map? And related to that, I think on a bit shipments, David, you mentioned for calendar ‘24, you guys are going to be, I think, down low single digits. But how should we think about bit production in calendar '24, given the CapEx and production cuts that you're going through right now?
Wissam Jabre: Well, maybe let me first start with the first part of the question on CapEx, Toshiya. The comment on CapEx is -- well, when you look at calendar -- sorry, fiscal '23, we've taken quite a bit of CapEx out from our plans as we continue to preserve cash. I mean you can see that we've spent, I think, year-on-year, we're down roughly 30% to 35%. And it's almost $1 billion lower than -- at the gross CapEx level, almost $1 billion lower than what our plan was at the beginning of the year for fiscal '23. For fiscal '24, we're projecting to be significantly lower. It's mostly in line -- it doesn't impact necessarily our product road map. It is more or less what we see today relative to what our NAND or basically other types of investments, meaning no other transitions or other types of investments planned. And so I wouldn't say there's any major change relative to what we've already been planning. But given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in, we will continue to monitor, just like we've done in fiscal '23 on a quarterly basis and adjust as needed.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering, you have any unique perspective having both HDDs and SSDs. There's commentary coming out of Pure, and I'm hearing more from some of the other storage vendors of a growing use of or cloud within data -- or sorry, growing use of SSDs within cloud and data centers and almost like a potential secular shift. Again, Pure takes it kind of to the extreme. But I'm just wondering how you think about how the mix will trend over time, maybe layer in AI, if you want? And just think about [Technical Difficulty] we should worry about what are you hearing from your customers? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Hey Shannon, thanks for the question. We've talked about this a lot over the years. I think that both technologies are growing in the data center. HDD is the predominant storage mechanism in the data center we don't expect that to change. Our customers don't expect that to change. As long as we continue to drive the HCD road map forward, we just -- we're ramping 26 terabyte. We're already launching 28 terabytes. So we're moving forward with capacity points on HDD. And we expect robust growth of HDD storage in the data center going forward. We also expect growth of enterprise SSD storage in the data center going forward. It's probably growing a little bit faster than HDD, but not in a way where you're looking at one is a substitute for the other. They're highly complementary technologies, and we expect that to be the case for any useful planning horizon in the future. We look at a decade out. The cost differences are still significant, and that's certainly the way we talk to our customers about how they're building mass scale data centers.
Shannon Cross: Okay. Great. And Wissam, can you talk a little bit about OpEx? How you're thinking about it relative to maybe a more normalized level? And how much loan for the model as revenues come back before you have to start spending more from an OpEx perspective?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, sure. So on OpEx, you saw we continue to manage it very, very tightly in fiscal Q4. We ended at $582 million, which is around $180 million lower than the same quarter last year. As to your question, over the near term, I think we're within sort of the range where we expect to be. But as the business starts coming back, there could be some small increase as we start layering up some of the variable expenses on that. However, we should never -- we shouldn't expect the increase in OpEx to be faster than the increase in revenue. And so we would be monitoring that, and it will be gradual. And similarly, if there's a need for us to take additional action on OpEx to continue to manage very tightly. We also have some room to do that.
David Goeckeler: Michelle, can we have the next question please?
Operator: We sure can. Just one moment. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two, Wissam. The first one is on underutilization charges. And it's kind of like a two-part question. So the first is what's the current utilization in NAND? And then on the HDD side, is there kind of a mild post as to where these could start to go away? Because you're guiding $70 million for September for underutilization in HDD. It sounds like it goes to maybe 60 to 65 in December quarter. But when does it go away because you started to take underutilization charges. I think when HDD revenue went sub $2-billion per quarter. So do we have to get all the way back to $2 billion a quarter to have those HDD underutilization charges go away?
Wissam Jabre: Okay. So Tim, with respect to the Flash side, we continue to make these decisions on an ongoing basis. And from the numbers, you can tell the underutilization related charges were are projected to be roughly flat from Q4 to Q1. As for HDD, I think the math is -- your math on Q1 is close to where the guidance is. But I think in the December quarter, think of the underutilization charges going, let's say, from Q1 to Q2 going down 5% or 10% and all of that decrease coming from HDD, you start seeing some declines basically in the HDD underutilization in the December quarter. And based on what we see today, it's a bit too early to talk about the second-half of the fiscal year 2024. But to the point you were making around the $2 billion revenue mark, we don't need to get to the $2 billion revenue mark to really fully utilize our capacity. If you recall, we've restructured quite a bit of our manufacturing capacity in the Hard Drive business, and we continue to take and optimize that fixed cost aspect of the cost structure. And so we can be fully utilized at a lower level than $2 billion, given the current cost structure.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot for that, Wissam. And then just on the debt service cost. So you have the convert due in February. I think that's at a pretty good rate. I think it's at 1.5%. So the debt you're going to replace that with, I imagine, is going to be pretty expensive. So it seems sort of -- I guess my question is sort of where does that leave you in the cap structure? Obviously, it seems like debt service costs are going to go up maybe $20 million a quarter once you have to issue new debt for that. So can you just talk about sort of how you solve for all that? Thanks.
Wissam Jabre: So yes, the current rate on the convert is 1.5%. And given where the interest rate environment is today, I would expect that to be replaced by that -- when replaced by that to be roughly more expensive than that. So look, it's a little bit too early to talk about it in a lot of details, but this is something that is definitely a focus for us as we think through the various options that are available to us. With respect to refinancing, for instance, we look at the potential cost of capital and our goal is to make sure that we maintain a lower cost of capital to the extent possible. But I expect it to be slightly up from here, all said.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Wissam.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Thanks, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Thanks so much. Really just -- two quick ones, if I could. When would you expect 26 terabyte and maybe I'll even through 28 in there since you mentioned it, David, there each crossover. And then I just have a quick follow-up to that. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Crossover as -- look, let me say that -- there's a lot of -- there's multiple different capacity points. So I think we need to maybe talk about this a little bit different. It doesn't just move from 14, 16, 18, maybe like it did two, three years ago. Now there's a bit of distribution of different customers and what kind of technologies they're using, whether it's 20s or 22s or 26s or going to 28s or even some 24s. So as I look at where things are going to be in the next couple of quarters, you're going to see a pretty even distribution across three or four different capacity points, all of them shipping 0.5 million or more drive. So we expect a very substantial ramp of 26. I don't want to take away from the ramp that's going to happen there. It's going to be very quick and very rapid now that it's qualified and getting close to being a leading capacity point in the next couple of quarters.
Ananda Baruah: Thanks for making the distinction. That's actually really helpful. And the follow-up is, do you guys have any view yet, any opinion, on when things normalize out in hard drives, if the hyperscalers return to what their classic utilization levels have been historically, how they run the capacity? Or do you think they settle in somewhat different on the utilization?
David Goeckeler: Look, I think anytime you go through a period like this, there's some work done on optimization of the infrastructure and consolidation, I think that's happening. But I would expect things -- you go through that and you just incrementally get better. Like anything in technology, you're constantly improving, constantly getting more efficient. I think that, that is something that's always going to go on and we're still going to see the growth in exabytes on top of that. So I think we're still looking at 20%, 25% exabyte growth in the HDD business. And I think we clearly haven't seen that in the last year, but we know it's a cyclical business, and we expect to get back to those levels.
Ananda Baruah: Right. That’s awesome. Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is going to come from the line of Karl Ackerman before we have a short statement by our CEO.
Karl Ackerman: Could you discuss how we should think about a recovery in nearline units and unit pricing as you and your peer implement a build-to-order process? And as you address that question, can you discuss how this build-to-order process may differ from long-term agreements signed in 2021 that were a bit challenging to implement over time?
David Goeckeler: So units, I expect to recover, right? I mean we're going to get exabyte growth. We're at a low point on units. We expect units to recover and get back to where they were and eclipse that actually as we continue to get exabyte growth. I'll put in say, a once again, I am very excited about generative AI. I know everybody is. But I think it's going to come to our world on storage once all this gets deployed. And so I expect to see units recover. I think the build-to-order process is going to be a fairly straightforward process because we have deep relationships with set of customers here. It's a big market. It's a big relationship. And I think it's just getting the business model to a place where there's better alignment between the infrastructure we have in place. Again, we've been talking about this for many years now that in a lot of ways, cloud has significantly benefited from the reduction in client and there's been a consistent availability of infrastructure to build hard drives. And we're at the end of that transition now, so we have to just have more planning around that. I think the long-term agreements were a step into that. I think this is maybe the next step into how do we run our franchise to make sure we've got the best alignment between delivering a great product and value proposition to our customers, which is extremely important, the storage is an incredibly important part of the data center and making sure that we have the right infrastructure in place to fuel that growth. So I expect it to be a pretty natural change or evolution of the business model, and I expect it to be a very positive on all sides. Thank you, Karl. All right, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-05-08 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital’s Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning & Analysis of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends, and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 third quarter results. Western Digital’s third quarter performance exceeded expectations with core metrics at the high-end of our guidance range, demonstrating the company's resilience in a challenging market environment. We reported third quarter revenue of 2.8 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 11% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.37. Over the last several years, our team is focused on enhancing business agility and delivering a range of innovative industry leading products that address the increasing data storage demands of our customers. The groundwork we laid combined with the actions we have taken since the beginning of this fiscal year to right size and refocus our business have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am pleased that we delivered non-GAAP gross margin at the higher-end of our guidance range due to strong execution across both our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, our early actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and focus our product offerings on delivering the best value for our data center customers have resulted in gross margin upside and profitable market share gains in HDD. In Flash, our broad go to market strategy anchored on our enviable retail franchise in a strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to optimize bid placement and bolster gross margin. During the fiscal third quarter, we saw signs of demand stabilizing across various end markets. In consumer, Our flash and HD results were consistent with the expectations we shared in January. In client, demand for each major product area came in better than we expected across PC OEM, channel, mobile and gaming. In cloud, demand for capacity enterprise hard drives improved whereas the demand for flash drives was consistent with our expectations set in January. Before I jump into updates on our HDD and Flash businesses, I would like to reiterate that the strategic review process is ongoing and we will provide updates as we have them. I'll now turn to the business update starting with HDD. During the fiscal third quarter, our HDD revenue improved sequentially with growth in capacity enterprise offsetting seasonal declines in retail and client. During the quarter, our 22 terabyte CMR drive became the highest volume product among all of our 20 terabyte and above capacity points. Demonstrating our leadership position at this capacity point. In addition, we expect the complete qualification of our 26 terabyte Ultra SMR technology in the fiscal fourth quarter. These innovative products provide multi-generation benefits to our customers. Turning to Flash, total exabyte shipment came in higher than expected in consumer, mobile, PC OEM, and channel products. Despite the industry experiencing the worst downturn in over a decade, Western Digital delivered positive product gross margin, excluding underutilization charges, driven by our unique combination of premium retail brands, broad go to market channels, and low cost flash supply from our joint venture fab with Kioxia. Furthermore, we continue to see encouraging signs of price elasticity driven content growth in retail flash led by WD Black, SSD optimized for gaming, as well as mobile PC OEMs and channel within client. On the technology front, BiCS6 achieved its anticipated cost crossover during the quarter. Moreover, on March 30, Western Digital and Kioxia announced our next generation BiCS8 node, a groundbreaking technology that builds upon the success of BiCS5 and BiCS6. This new technology is based on circuit bonded to array architecture, which provides several benefits, including reduced cycle time faster yield ramp, better or lateral scaling, and industry leading IO performance when compared to products based on circuit under array architecture. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 for a broad range of applications, which will position Western Digital for success as business conditions improve. As we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, in hard drives, overall demand will be impacted by ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers and a sustained decline in client. However, we are beginning to experience improved demand at certain customers in China. In Flash, we are seeing signs of stabilization and content increase per unit. PC OEMs have emerged from inventory digest and are now shipping closer to end demand. Gaming will remain strong, while enterprise SSD for cloud applications will remain soft. We anticipate modest growth in bit shipments into the fiscal fourth quarter. Before I hand the call over to Wissam, I would like to thank the Western Digital team for the response efforts they made in addressing the network security incident we disclosed on April 2nd. Our team took proactive and precautionary measures to secure our operations and successfully executed on our business continuity plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results reflected the challenging market environment with continued pressure on revenue and profitability. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down 10% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.37. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 43% of total revenue at 1.2 billion, down 2% sequentially, driven by an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments, which was offset by a decrease in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 79 exabytes, up 31% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue declined 32%, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products, as well as price decreases in Flash. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC application. Finally, consumer represented 22% of total revenue at 0.6 billion, down 22% sequentially, and 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products, as well as price declines in retail flash. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and price declines in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. HDD revenue was 1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased [50%]] and average price per hard drive increased 10% to $109. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 23%, and average price per unit increased 9%. Flash revenue was 1.3 billion, down 21% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 10% on a blended basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses, please note that my comments would be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 10.6%, down 6.8 percentage points sequentially and 21.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $275 million of charges for manufacturing underutilization, inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was higher than anticipated at 24.3%, up 3.6 percentage points sequentially and down 3.4 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher capacity enterprise volume, as well as lower manufacturing costs and underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were less than projected at approximately $40 million or 2.7 percentage points, partially benefiting from the actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and offsetting other charges of $22 million. Flash gross margin was negative 5%, down 19.5 percentage points sequentially, and 40.6 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges associated with the reduced manufacturing volumes were approximately $160 million or 12.2 percentage points, less than expected as we focused on lowering manufacturing costs. During the quarter, we incurred $53 million of flash inventory write-down charges resulting from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were at $602 million for the quarter, down 57 million sequentially and 138 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $304 million, driven by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling 275 million. Income tax expense was $60 million. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal third quarter loss per share was $1.37, inclusive of a $9 million dividend cost associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was an out flow of 381 million and free cash flow was an outflow of 527 million. Cash, capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement was $146 million. Gross debt outstanding was 7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was 2.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x, compared to 2.1x in the fiscal second quarter. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation addback associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.  At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $5.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of 2.2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of 2.25 billion, and unused delayed draw term loan facility of 875 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. We expect HDD revenue to decrease sequentially, due to ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers. We expect Flash revenue to decrease sequentially as modest growth in bit shipments is more than offset by ASP declines. We expect Flash bit shipment growth to accelerate in the first half of fiscal year 2024. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin will be negatively impacted by underutilization charges and Flash pricing. We continue to tightly manage our cost structures through this dynamic environment and expect operating expenses to be below $600 million.  For fiscal year 2023, we project gross capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion, and cash capital expenditures to be approximately 0.8 billion. The projected cash capital expenditures represent more than a 50% reduction from our forecast as we entered fiscal year 2023 and approximately 35% reduction from fiscal year 2022. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 3% and 5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $220 million to $240 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $580 million to $600 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately 90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $60 million and $70 million. We expect loss per share of $2.20 to $1.90, assuming approximately 321 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Over the past few quarters, we have successfully ramped a series of industry-leading storage products and commercialized innovative technologies, while concurrently rightsizing our cost structure. Our proactive actions have positioned Western Digital favorably for the future as demand gradually returns to normal levels. In closing, I would like to thank our team members for their unwavering commitment in advancing innovative products and driving operational efficiency. Their exceptional efforts have allowed Western Digital to deliver in [Technical Difficulty] to the dedication and support of our people worldwide, and we remain committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all that we do. Okay. I look forward to your questions. Let's open it up.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I'd love to get a sense for where you're seeing demand stabilize versus where you still see pockets of inventory? And as part of that, I guess embedded in your revenue guide, it looks like you're kind of suggesting HDD down maybe 10% to 15%, SSD down 5% to 10%. So, I guess is that kind of the right way to think about it? And then as part of that, where do you think we're seeing stabilization and where do you think we need to work down inventory some more?
David Goeckeler: Inventory correction there is mostly behind us. Our channel business performed really well this past quarter, I think, above what our expectation was. The inventory issue is still very much in data center and it's very lumpy. We have some big cloud customers that are consuming. We have others that are really in a full inventory digestion and aren't taking anything. So that market is still where we see a lot of inventory digestion going on. And I expect that to be lumpy for the next couple of quarters. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in China. We talked about that. I think it's setting up for recovery in the second half of the year, a lot more activity around RFPs and discussions about what demand is going to look like the second half. So, that's a bit – an overview of where we see the market. I think on your numbers, you're probably down a little more than we are on HDD. I think that's probably more a single-digit kind of number on a sequential basis.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, can you kind of walk us through what you're thinking today in terms of underutilization charges beyond the June quarter?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Well, let's talk about for each business. I mean, I think in HDD and I'm sure Wissam will have a little bit to add here as well. HDD, which is the smaller part of the number, but still significant we're going to see a drop in volume next quarter. So, we'll see some underutilization there. On the Flash side, we continue to underutilize the fab. We're managing it in a very dynamic way, kind of week-to-week month-to-month to make sure we've fully understand demand and keep our inventory in a position where we want it. And so – but we will definitely see underutilization on both sides of the business next quarter.
Wissam Jabre: And just to add – C.J., sorry, just to add a bit more color, I think we – in our guide, we're estimating around [220 to 240] [ph], the range of underutilization charges. And by business, this is roughly two-thirds Flash, one-thirds HDD or one-third [SSD] [ph].
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. You mentioned that you're taking lower cost for market charges on NAND, can you talk about the methodology there? Is that – do you pool that and then take a charge overall or is it anytime any individual product falls below the market price you adjusted down? 
David Goeckeler: So, Joe with respect to our LCM charges, we do it at the finished good product level. It is not pulled.
Joe Moore: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of the underutilization charges and things like that, do you know how the covenants are going to be defined? Are you going to be able to remove those charges from the EBITDA number as defined in the covenant?
David Goeckeler: Those are typically allowed to be added back per our credit agreement to the EBITDA.
David Goeckeler: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks Joe.
Operator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thank you for taking the questions. Just to build on that last question, just to be safe. Your gross margin expectation in this current quarter, I'm guessing the commentary assumes that you're not expecting another inventory charge in the flash business? And if so why not?
Wissam Jabre: So Aaron, we typically factor into our guidance all the expectations. And when we exited Q3, like a typical quarter, we do our reserve reviews and we take the – we make sure that the balance sheet properly stated. And so based on our forecast, everything is baked into the guidance. Typically, we have a small amount in the guidance just like we did also in the past quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question is on the hard disk drive business, I can appreciate you guys seeing some cloud customers, kind of – it sounds like purchased really no product this last quarter. I'm guessing from a competitive perspective how would you characterize the current environment? Have you seen increased price aggressiveness? How do you guys think about the discussion around HAMR and your roadmap going forward, etcetera?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean, I think there's always price pressure in this market Aaron, but we've been very disciplined about the value of our products. I think you – one of the things we feel very good about is, we've been investing in our HDD roadmap, things like OptiNAND, ePMR, UltraSMR, these products are really now starting to ship in volume. We talked about the 22-terabyte CMR drive was the highest volume drive at 20 and above. So, we feel very good about where the portfolio is, about where it's going. We've got a number of very large customers qualifying SMR right now. That's clearly the next step in the data center, our UltraSMR product there, the 2016, we talked about we'll finish up calls this quarter and start deploying next quarter. So, we feel like we've got a portfolio that is aligned with what the market needs. And that's showing up in, kind of how we're able to monetize that portfolio and not have to compete on price. So, future technologies like HAMR will be there. We're still are ways away before that product is going to be a volume type product. The volume products are the 22s going and then SMR are going to be the big volume products over the next couple of years and after that we'll get to HAMR. We feel confident about that technology. It's been in development for a long time. We're in the final stages of it as an industry and I think everybody is excited that it will be the roadmap for 30 and above when we need it.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the network security breach. Can you give us an update on the recovery there? Looks like your operations are back to normal levels, but have you experienced or do you expect any more issues with productions or your ability to ship products?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we've been very transparent about that incident. When we noticed it, we let folks know, we took our – we basically disconnected ourselves from the public Internet to protect ourselves and then restore the environment. We still have capabilities inside the companies and the factories were operational throughout that. Clearly, a tremendous amount of work by the team, but we feel like we're nearly all the way back now as far as operation. We got to bring the store online in here in another week or so, but it was really, really good to see our business continuity plans, you don't want to rely on them too often, but when we had two, they were there and they kept the company moving forward.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. Thanks for that update.
Wissam Jabre: Sorry, Sidney. I just wanted to add that for fiscal Q3, we don't have any impact in the numbers to the network security.
Sidney Ho: Okay. That's great. Maybe my follow-up question is, Samsung [indiscernible] talk about their cutting production. I'm curious if your competition with the customers have changed since that announcement, and related to that, do you expect the June quarter to be the bottom of – for your margins for your Flash business? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: I would say, we have – I mean obviously we have very robust conversations with our customers all the time. I wouldn't pin the tone of conversations on to how any one particular player in the market is acting or what they're doing. We stay very focused on our business. As far as where is the bottom, I mean we expect the market to come into balance as we go through the second half of the year. I think we're clearly taking a lot of actions in our own business to closely manage it, supply and demand. Keep the utilization of the fab close to where demand is. So, we manage our inventory. Clearly, we're going through one of the most severe downturns in a while, but we think as we move through the second half of the year the market will come into balance.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. One near term and more to with inventory. Your inventories are – absolute dollar value keeps going higher. And I want to understand how the mix is changing between wafers, finished good, and other material? Is there any way you can give us a color how incremental changes are happening for different categories within inventory, and have a follow-up?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, we typically don't break that out as much on the call. This is a bit too much detail, Mehdi, for me to discuss here. The one comment I would make though, when we think of inventory, our operations team is really focused on minimizing where we can. So, we basically try to stage it in the places that makes the most sense from a demand perspective.
Mehdi Hosseini: Let me rephrase the question. How do you – how should we think about the risk of inventory write-down?
Wissam Jabre: I mean, the inventory write-down typically is, it's really based – the ones that was, for instance, I called out is based on basically the inventory value relative to where the market price is. And so, if – when prices decline by a lot, then we do have to take a closer look and see if there's any impact, but that's what I would say about that.
Mehdi Hosseini: So, would – are you assuming that the rate of price decline is moderating, so maybe that would minimize the downside risk?
Wissam Jabre: What I'm saying is, we – what I'm saying is, at the end of every quarter our balance sheet is properly stated because we do look at where the inventory value is versus where the demand is and the prices are most particularly at the finished good level. And so, where we see differences we have to adjust our inventory value, otherwise it is properly stated. I guess your question is more around trying to predict where the price is going and we typically don't necessarily do that.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you. And then the question for David, looking at longer-term more than just one quarter. I think there is some confusion or unknown factor how new type of AI would impact demand for HDD versus SSD, do you have any view how this incremental demand created. These are expensive working stations. How is it going to impact SSD versus HDD?
David Goeckeler: We're doing analysis on that, Mehdi. What I would say is, to me – I'll even go a little longer-term, bigger picture. This just reinforces the value of stored data. I think that it just seems like there's this constant ways for people can figure out how to use all the data they've stored to do very productive things with it. And I think the latest is training these AI engines. And so, we just think it's another element of the long-term value of data storage and it's just a big secular tailwind for the HDD business and the enterprise SSD business. I mean, again, you know that they're both – they both have big TAMs in the data center, and they're both growing. And we think this is another reason why people will store more data is because they can monetize it in different ways in the future.
Mehdi Hosseini: But I guess I was hoping you would shed some light as to how the HDD CAGR would change? I don't think this is going to lift the TAM for each different types of stores at the same rate. Is there any thoughts that you can share with us?
David Goeckeler: I think it will – HDD is the lion's share of storage in the cloud. So, you would expect that's where the bigger lift would be across those two technologies.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Mehdi. It’s good to talk to you as always.
Operator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first is, as you look at what you're doing on OpEx in terms of holding in cost, how do you think about the – how you're – where you're investing? And how are you making those decisions? And how should we think about potential impact to future projects at this point? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We've been very – obviously, we've been – one of the things we've been building into the business over the last several years as we've restructured the business is more agility and the ability to proactively respond to the market we're in. I think that's kind of the hallmark of the organization we're trying to build is agile and dynamic. But clearly, on top of that, Shannon, we went to a business unit structure for a reason. It's because we have two very, very focused organizations with very sophisticated leaders in them that is constantly doing the ROI analysis of where we put our OpEx, and we get the most out of it. And I think quite frankly, that's led to the portfolio we have today. I think we have the best portfolio we've ever had. And that's an effort that goes on constantly, continuously. And so, as we continue to draw down OpEx to resize the business to the realities of what the market is. We've built the capability over the last couple of years to do that in a way where we can make sure we're going to get – first of all, the OpEx we spend, we get the best ROI out of it, the best return and that we make sure that we're making – we're taking actions to the business that don't harm the long-term value of it, and we make the right decision on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month basis. So, I think this is really a capability we've built in the last three years, and I think it's serving us well right now to make sure that we're not cutting in ways that are going to impact the long-term health of the business.
Shannon Cross: Thank you. That was helpful. I'm curious – and maybe I'm trying to make lemonade out of lemons. But I'm just wondering, as you've cut capacity on the HDD side, and you've had these underutilization charges, are there things that you've learned in terms of maybe how you manufactured in the past ways to drive incremental productivity? I'm just thinking it's kind of – it's certainly a unique time to maybe take a step back and look how things are – how things have been done and what you can do in the future? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: So, I'll make a few comments. I suspect Wissam will have a few comments as well. I mean this is – there's been a lot of focus on this in the last year of how do we become more efficient, how do we automate more. Several of our factories have won World Economic Forum Lighthouse awards for automation. How do we rescale our employees? And how do we just – we've been very focused on driving a level of automation, driving productivity, and just lowering our fixed cost asset base in the HDD business. And I think our fixed – I don't think I know, our fixed costs in that business are now the lowest they've been in well over a decade. So, I think that's paying off in the way we're able to generate margin in the business at lower volume levels. And then as the volume starts to pick back up, we've got capacity to meet what the market needs, and I think we'll do that at a much lower cost basis.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. I mean the one thing I would add also, in addition to what David said, some of the activities that we drive in terms of the manufacturing side are taken back into the development organizations to think about things that come on platforms and the ability to improve on the way our products are designed for manufacturing efficiency, even increasing manufacturing efficiency going forward. And of course, with that comes a better cost structure.
Shannon Cross: Alright. Thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Shannon. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for talking my question. David, first question is on your NAND ASP decline in March quarter, seems to be better than what your competitors had. I'm just kind of curious, any puts and takes if you talk about your specific pricing versus competition in March, how to think about it in June? And along the same path, you mentioned the supply-demand balance later this year and bit shipment for flash growing. Are you baking in some, kind of a mobile recovery that's going to help you drive that? And then I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think on pricing, it's kind of the same story all the time, right? Whether it's a down market, upmarket, mid-cycle market, which is really have a diverse portfolio. We've talked about this a lot from retail to the channel business, PC OEMs, enterprise SSD gaming has become a very nice part of the portfolio and growing part of the portfolio. And it's just that – mobile, obviously, is a big part of our portfolio. And it's just been mixing across that where we get the best return, right, putting our supply and our bits in the places where we can get the best return. I do think that, that is a – that go to – that breadth of go-to-market is in markets that we can reach literally from every single consumer to the largest technology companies in the world and kind of everything in between. And just the ability to mix across that with a strong portfolio and a strong set of brands as well, SanDisk, SanDisk Professional, WD_BLACK, puts us in a good position to get the best return on our supply. Next quarter, we don't really want to comment on future pricing. It's all into the guide. We've talked about the individual markets. What I would say is, we're pricing in or we're putting in what we think is going to do on an individual market-by-market basis and then how we'll mix that next quarter.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the dividend. And then as a follow-up on the HDD side, it's kind of nice to see the 22 terabyte CMR is now bigger than 20 terabytes in terms of volume. How should we expect that to grow? And what is its impact on gross margin?
David Goeckeler: I think that's our focus – on a CMR drive, that's our focused capacity point and it's significantly ahead of other CMR drives above 20. So – or above the 20 terabyte drive. We expect that to be our premier drive for the next – until we have a different CMR product in that part of the business. So, we expect that to be a very good growth engine, and we've talked a lot about that drive of – it provides a lot of value. It provides a lot of TCO value for our customers. And we – it contributes an appropriate amount of margin from that perspective as well.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks David.
David Goeckeler : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It's [indiscernible] filling in for Wamsi today. David, I think maybe another pricing question for you. I think you talked about price elasticity. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what exactly you're seeing either in Flash or in HDD? And a related question to that is, there's some worry that maybe a lot of memory inventory might be built again this quarter from the likes of some OEMs like Apple because they want to maximize their favorable component pricing? So, do you think this could lead to a further elongation in the recovery of the market, even though in the near-term it might get a little bit tighter? So, just your thoughts on that? And what exactly are you seeing in price elasticity?
David Goeckeler: I think the elasticity in NAND is mainly what I was talking about. I mean, we're seeing PC OEM up mid-20s year-over-year on capacity. I think a really interesting number to me is the elasticity across our consumer franchise, which is tens – hundreds of millions of devices we sell a year in that channel up a third year-over-year on capacity per unit.  Gaming up more than that, and mobile up even more than that. So, I think we're seeing the market work. Even in the midst of a great downturn, you expect – well, especially in the midst of a great downturn, you expect to see elasticity start to kick in, and we are starting to see that across the portfolio. What was the second part of the question, again?
Unidentified Analyst: It was about a customer [indiscernible].
David Goeckeler: Prebuying. Yes. I think you do see – I think we are seeing instances of that. I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but we see instances of it. And I think it – I think maybe it's a sign of where the customers think we are in the cycle as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. So, for my follow-up, if I can ask a quick one to Wissam, how are you thinking about free cash flow going forward? I mean is it – what needs to happen to get to positive free cash flow? And is that possible in this calendar year? So, just your thoughts on that? I mean, how are you looking at working capital and thinking about free cash flow? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, [real close] [ph]. So, we are totally focused on free cash flow. As you've seen us since the beginning of the year, we've been very proactive on OpEx, reducing that quite a bit on CapEx, as well as taking underutilization to manage and preserve our cash and not build inventory. And so, this is very important to us. In fact, we continue to make improvements. I mean, if you look at our CapEx trend, it's gone down quite a bit. This year, we'll probably be spending approximately if not even more than 35% below last year. With respect to the next few quarters, we typically do not guide for free cash flow. But what I could say is that this is, as I said, a top priority for us and is a big focus, as you would imagine, as we navigate the dynamic environment.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for all the detail. Appreciate.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O'Malley: Hi, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my question. My first one is related to the HDD side of the business. Your competitor recently talked about a recovery that initially was expected to be in June and is now pushed out to the December quarter. Could you just frame the way that you're thinking about the recovery? Is it kind of in-line with that? You're obviously guiding the HDD business down, but any color you could give on the back half of the calendar year about when you expect that business to recover?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think, Tom, it's – I would say as we go through the second half of the year, it will get better. The issue is that these revenue levels and these unit levels, it's just very lumpy. You have very large customers that if they buy or not buy, it can impact the TAM and the available market in a very significant way. So – and that's what we're experiencing next quarter. I mean, this quarter, we saw things were a little better than we thought on capacity enterprise shipments. We'll see a sequential decline in that, and then we're expecting to go back up as we go in the second half of the year. But I expect it to be lumpy as we go through this inventory digestion because a lot like we saw in the PC OEM space, a lot of customers are just completely focused on inventory digestion, which is basically new purchases just go to zero. And customers at this scale with this, kind of business that has an impact. So, I expect to see a lumpiness over the next several quarters. I do have a level of optimism about China in the second half of the year. We're seeing better activity there. And so, we expect to see that improve in the second half of the year as well, which should also help the business.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful. And then just a follow-up is on the Flash side. You guys talked about a mix of customer behavior, right, where some are still consuming inventory and then others are more aggressively purchasing to various degrees. I don't want you to speak on specific customers, but we've heard this across the ecosystem, particularly through this earnings period here where there is a discrepancy in terms of spend.  Could you help maybe just frame where you're seeing that spend? Is there a certain type of customer that's spending more than others or is it really just random where guys came in with certain inventory levels and are working through that? Just any color there would be really helpful as we've heard that data point from multiple companies here?
David Goeckeler: I guess I would say that customers that are different segments of the market that are through their inventory digestion are now more or less shipping to end demand being lean on inventory. There are instances of people doing strategic buys in that – in some of those cases where they've got their inventory to where they want it, but now they're making their own – they have their own view of the cycle. That's a very small number, I would say. And then the other one is just – where they're at in their – the data center customers especially are just in – there's a variability of the level of inventory at each customer, and they're so big that it can impact the entire market. So – and like I said, ones that have heavy inventory are basically working that down in an aggressive way. And so, I think it's going to – like I said, I think it will be lumpy for a couple of quarters until we get through that.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. David, three months ago, you mentioned that you were cutting production in your NAND business by 30%. I'm curious if the magnitude of the cuts today are, kind of in that ZIP code, if anything has changed materially? And going forward, what would you need to see to start taking up your utilization rates in the Flash business?
David Goeckeler: Yes. We're kind of at the point where we're – I think it's – I think probably the same ZIP Code is probably a fair way to say depending on where you live, ZIP codes can be pretty big if you're in the country, I guess. But it's really about managing to where we see the demand and keeping our inventory relatively in check. We know it's going up somewhat, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away from us. So, we'll use the fab in that. I mean, we're just – we're going to have to see demand signals for our customers is just as simple as that. We have a very close relationship with a lot of them. We're in the – obviously, in the market every single day. A lot of these consumer and channel markets are more transactional, where we can see the business across a wide swath. And then, of course, we're talking to the biggest customers biggest technology companies in the world. So, we'll get a – we have a pretty good idea of where their demand is, and we'll set the fab appropriately to make sure that we keep the right inventory position and we have the product when they're ready.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then one follow-up for Wissam on the balance sheet side of things. I know you don't guide free cash flow on a quarterly basis or annual basis, but just curious how we should be thinking about inventory, whether it be dollars or days, going into the June quarter and working capital overall. Is that going to be a consumer of cash in the June quarter or do you think you can generate some cash from working capital? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Sure, Toshiya. With respect to inventory, the current projection is, I would say, flattish in terms of dollar, but in terms of days, I anticipate we should see a downtick from here. Well, we continue to, as David said, manage it on a very, very regular basis very closely. And so, that's probably the biggest in terms of the working capital. That's the number that would be moving the most. Again, we don't guide the free cash flow, so I wouldn't want to make any more comments around working capital. But I think the answer on the inventory would be a good indicator to what working capital will look.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The market share numbers are out for last year, you guys drove a strong number 2 position in client SSD, strong double-digit sort of percentage share position, right? But in enterprise, you guys drove, sort of low single-digit enterprise SSD market share last year, and it’s sort of hovered in this 4% to 7% range for a while now, like what is the team doing to try and drive its share in this fast-growing market to more of what I would call appropriate, sort of double-digit percentage share profile?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Always good to hear from you. We've talked about this quite a bit over the last year. It's about qualifying the products at the big players, qualified in the channel. We just qualified this last quarter on BiCS5 enterprise SSD with some of the biggest customers. So, the road map is moving forward as we expected. It's just a very dynamic market right now. So, it's difficult to judge share. Obviously, our goal is what we've put out there is to drive that higher. And I have every confidence we'll do that as the market stabilizes and some of these big customers get back to their normal rates of purchasing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. I have a question on the cost side, Wissam. So, it's a little tricky to figure out given all the, I guess, one-time charges. I'm just wondering, you previously talked about NAND cost declines in the mid-teens, I believe, just wondering if you're tracking to that. And then as we go to BiCS8, how should we think about the cost declines, especially – I guess, historically, we've had 30% to 40% bit demand growth. And going forward, if that dynamic changes, if it's lower than 30%, do you think we can still, kind of get to that mid-teens cost declines or do you need the 30% to get to that level?
Wissam Jabre: Sure. So, thanks for the question. In terms of Q3, we have to think of it basically with and without underutilization. When you factor in the entry underutilization charges, we wouldn't be – we wouldn't have reduced cost or cost income down by mid-teens. However, if we exclude that, then we're close to mid-teens in Q3.  Now, to your question on BiCS8. I mean this is – with the way our road map works and the timing of when BiCS8 starts ramping, it is pretty much designed in a way to allow us to continue that mid-teens reduction – cost reduction over time. I wouldn't want to comment about the exact sort of percentage and so on in terms of the crossover because I think it's a little bit premature to talk about this. But conceptually, that's what we're aiming with ramping BiCS8 slightly earlier than previously anticipated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss the trajectory of exabyte demand of your cloud customers in the next couple of quarters? And whether there's a divergence and a recovery across on-prem and public cloud? And I guess as you address that question, how do you assess whether you might be shipping below normalized replacement demand? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: I think we see the enterprise and the cloud market. They're both soft right now. So, we don't see a huge difference between the two. Again, the difference is, Karl, that you got this idiosyncratic behavior at really big customers. So, a customer that usually buys a significant amount of hard drives in a quarter, hundreds of millions of dollars goes to zero. You can pretty much assume they're buying under replacement demand. So, that's kind of where we're at. We just – again, other customers are going along more according to plan. So, the inventory level is a bit distributed across big customers. So, we look at this quite a bit to understand like where do we think the exabyte growth is and where are we setting the – our long-term production capabilities and all of that. But right now, it's just a little difficult to draw long-term conclusions and some of – a little bit behind some of your question, given just the way the market is – the lumpiness of the market.
Operator: The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi. Just a quick question. I don't know if you talked about Elliott strategies, and I think they had filed some – they had some filings, but just wondering how that process is progressing? I don't know if you can talk to it.
David Goeckeler: It's progressing. Very active. Everybody in it is under NDA, so I can't say anything about it, and we look forward to talking about it when we reach a conclusion.
Operator: Our last question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Maybe for Wissam. I might have missed it, but just wondering if there's any context you can provide about how you're thinking about the debt due in February of 2024? How you're going to handle that, go back handling that? Thanks.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, Ananda. With respect to the 1.1 billion of convert due in February 2024, the plan is to address it over the next couple of quarters.
Peter Andrew: Okay. Jason, is that the last one?
Operator: Yes, that was the last question.
David Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you through the quarter. Take care.
Peter Andrew: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-01-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded.  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 second quarter results. The Western Digital team worked diligently within a dynamic market and delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range we provided in October. We reported second quarter revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million. Our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Our ongoing efforts to control expenses, optimize working capital and deploy capital judiciously helped us manage cash flow amidst a challenging flash pricing environment and larger-than-expected ACD underutilization that pressured gross margins.  Before we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I wanted to cover two other announcements that we are making today. First, we disclosed that Western Digital has entered into agreements with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments totaling $900 million. In connection with the agreement, Reed Raymond, a partner at Apollo, will join our Board starting immediately. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to welcome Reed, a leading technology investor who will provide us with additional financial and strategic expertise, which will be critical as we continue to execute on our business strategy and complete our strategic review. Second, on January 25, we secured access to $875 million of financing through a delayed draw term loan. When combined with the actions we undertook to structurally lower our cost structure, these financings provide valuable financial optionality and flexibility to Western Digital as we continue our strategic review. Regardless of the outcome of the strategic review, our goal is to ensure the business is in a solid financial position to invest in innovation and create long-term shareholder value. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review process or making comments on market rumors. We will provide updates as we have them. Over the past three years, we have worked continuously to reinvigorate innovation and bolster business agility for both our flash and HDD organizations, which enabled the Western Digital team to stay ahead of the market. Over the same period, we paid down $2.7 billion in debt and arranged for settlement of a long-standing tax dispute. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have taken additional actions to reset the business in response to the post-pandemic environment. These actions include: first, we have further reduced our capital expenditures across Flash and HDD to moderate our supply. As a result, our projected cash capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 has declined nearly 40% from six months ago. Second, we have decreased supply bid growth across both Flash and HDD. In Flash, we reduced wafer starts by 30% in January. In HDD, during the fiscal first quarter, we consolidated production lines across our manufacturing facilities and idled certain media production lines in Asia, reducing client hard drive capacity by approximately 40%. During the fiscal second quarter, we continued to optimize our capacity enterprise manufacturing footprint to align our supply with the new demand environment. Third, we have reduced our quarterly non-GAAP operating expense by over $100 million since the close of fiscal year 2022, driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and variable compensation. We are targeting to reduce quarterly non-GAAP operating expense level to below $600 million by the time we exit the fiscal year. And lastly, in December, we successfully executed an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreement. Turning to end market demand during the fiscal second quarter. Demand for consumer-oriented products stabilized as we discussed in October. In Consumer, we experienced a seasonal uptick across both Flash and HDD. In client, channel demand for both SSD and HDD have improved. However, commercial PCs are now being impacted by tightening budgets and spending across corporations, which is negatively affecting client SSD shipments. In cloud, we experienced a decline in nearline shipments as our customers were undergoing inventory digestion and ongoing subdued China demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. During the fiscal second quarter, our HDD revenue declined significantly as cloud inventory digestion intensified, while demand for retail and client HDD improved.  We continue to successfully execute on our product road map as we completed qualifications and commenced shipments of our latest generation 22-terabyte CMR hard drives at multiple cloud and major OEM customers last quarter. We are aggressively ramping this 22 terabyte CMR product this quarter and expect this drive along with its SMR variants to be our growth engine going forward. Qualifications of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drives are also progressing well. Our major customers remain committed to adopting SMR drives as the 20% capacity gain that UltraSMR drives over CMR offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. We expect sequential growth in revenue and margin into our fiscal third quarter and continued recovery as we move through calendar year 2023. Turning to Flash. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading retail franchise combined with strong seasonal demand, bit shipments increased 20% sequentially, exceeding our forecast.  While we continue to experience pricing pressure in the market, our premium brands, including SanDisk, SanDisk Professional and WD_BLACK continued to deliver strong share and profitability to support the business. Our premium WD_BLACK client SSD, which is optimized for gaming continues to be well received in the marketplace. It achieved a record exabyte shipments, unit shipments and average capacity per drive resulting in exabyte shipment increase of 73% sequentially and 41% year-over-year for this product. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented 70% of our flash revenue in the December quarter, while BiCS6 will reach cost crossover in the fiscal third quarter. Our next-generation 3D NAND node BiCS8 has entered productization phase. BiCS8 incorporates several groundbreaking 3D NAND architectural innovations to deliver a major leap in performance and cost-effective solutions to a broad range of exciting products, demonstrating the benefits of Western Digital's strong partnership with Kioxia and our innovation leadership in 3D NAND architecture. As we look into the fiscal third quarter, in hard drives, overall demand in cloud has stabilized, and we expect modest improvement in near line to offset a seasonal decline in client and consumer hard drives. We expect stronger improvements in the second half of this calendar year, led by the aggressive ramp of our 22 and 26 terabyte hard drives. In flash, we expect enterprise SSD product demand for the fiscal third quarter to be sharply reduced as certain large cloud customers have entered a digestion period. In addition, a reduction in commercial PC demand is expected to impact client SSD shipments in the near term. Driven by the lower customer demand forecast in enterprise and client SSDs, we anticipate bit shipments to decline in the fiscal third quarter and return to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Western Digital lowered wafer starts in January, and we remain flexible in adjusting the magnitude and duration to restore our flash supply and demand balance. As noted, for calendar year 2023, we expect reduced capital investment and lower utilization in response to the new demand environment. Our initial estimate is for flash demand bit growth to be in the low 20% range with production bit growth to be well below that of demand.  With that, let me turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the third quarter.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, down 17% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 39% of revenue at $1.2 billion, down 33% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Sequentially, the declines in capacity enterprise drives sold to our cloud customers and smart videos were partly offset by an increase in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 61 exabytes, down sequentially, driven by inventory digestion. The year-over-year decline was also primarily due to inventory digestion in hard drives. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 11% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was driven by pricing pressure across our Flash products, which was partly offset by an increase in hard drive shipments. The year-over-year decline was also due to pricing pressure in Flash as well as lower client SSD shipments for PC applications. Finally, consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by a seasonal uptick in both retail hard drives and Flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and pricing pressure in Flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $1.5 billion down 28% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 35% and average price per hard drive decreased 21% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 33%, and average price per unit increased 2%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 20% on a blended basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 20% sequentially and remained approximately flat year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 17.4%, down 9.3 percentage points sequentially and 16.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 7.8 percentage points sequentially and 9.9 percentage points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decline was due to underutilization related charges of approximately $100 million. Our Flash gross margin was 14.5%, down 10 percentage points sequentially and 21.6 percentage points year-over-year. We are continuing to reduce our costs with operating expenses at $659 million for the quarter, down $30 million sequentially. Operating loss was $119 million. Taxes were a benefit of $48 million. Taxes are influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was a loss of $0.42. operating cash flow for the second quarter was $35 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $240 million. Cash capital expenditure which includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was $275 million.  Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.3 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.1 times compared to 1.5 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.8 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. As David mentioned, during the fiscal second quarter, we executed an amendment to the credit agreement that temporarily increased the covenant leverage ratio for the next seven quarters. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a revolver capacity of $2.25 billion for total liquidity of $4.1 billion. Today, we announced multiple agreements to further enhance our liquidity position by $1.8 billion as follows.  On January 25, we closed the delayed draw term loan agreement with our lenders in the amount of $875 million. In addition, as David mentioned, Western Digital entered into an agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for a convertible preferred investment of $900 million.  Together, these actions significantly increase our ability to access liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility and optionality as we manage through this challenging downturn and execute on our strategic review. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook and the financial impact associated with the actions we are taking to rightsize our cost structure.  In HDD, we expect revenue to increase modestly in the fiscal third quarter as growth in nearline shipments outpaces decline in consumer. In Flash, we expect both shipments and ASP to decrease sequentially. We expect bit growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to approximately $2.3 billion compared to our prior forecast of $3.2 billion entering this fiscal year. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure to $900 million which is about 40% below our forecast six months ago. The primary drivers of our lower capital expenditures are the delay of the BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investment levels in both client and capacity enterprise hard drive manufacturing.  We have reduced our quarterly operating expenses by over $100 million compared to six months ago. We are targeting to exit this fiscal year with quarterly operating expenses below $600 million. These actions will allow us to weather this cycle while also enabling us to continue advancing our innovative product road map going forward. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in Flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with Flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts.  We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect tax expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million for the fiscal third quarter and approximately $240 million to $260 million for the fiscal year. We expect loss per share of $1.70 to $1.40 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 319 million shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Before we open up for questions, I wanted to reiterate our view of the long-term opportunities for both Flash and HDD storage. Importantly, our efforts have enabled us to regain architectural leadership in both Flash and HDD, and we are preparing these technologies to address the meaningful long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With our diverse portfolio, broad go-to-market engine, an enviable retail franchise and a lower cost structure, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. Okay. Peter, let's open up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously, we're kind of in a perfect storm here. But curious, as you think about maintaining your technological competitiveness in the NAND side, while at the same time, significantly slowing down CapEx for both you as well as what we've heard from Kioxia for BiCS6. I guess, how do you balance those two things? How do you set the stage into a recovery and maintaining that leadership? And how much longer can you squeeze the requisite kind of 15% cost down out of BiCS5.
David Goeckeler: C.J., thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So yes, that's a balancing act. There's no doubt. I mean one of the things we talked about in the script and we feel really good about is BiCS8, I think BiCS8 has reached productization. We'll have more to say about BiCS8. Siva will do -- I think we'll do a webinar during the quarter on all the technological innovation there. There's been an enormous amount of R&D going into that. So, we feel very good about where we are from a technology road map. I'm actually in my hand right here I'm holding a BiCS8 USB, one of the first ones. And so, we're putting enough capital in the system to move BiCS6 along. I mean, BiCS6 will be a shorter node for us. It won't go into all products. We'll be making choices about what we take it into or where we need BiCS6, BiCS5 will serve us well for the rest of the portfolio, and then we'll move right into BiCS8, which quite frankly, is ahead of schedule as far as production, and we feel very good about it. So, we'll balance all of that and have enough capital to accelerate, have enough BiCS6 there that we need it and then accelerate BiCS8 when we see the growth come back. As far as the cost downs, look, I mean, in the second half of the year, cost downs are going to be very difficult because we are far along in BiCS5 and BiCS6 is not ramping that much. We'll return to those as we start to ramp BiCS8.  But we'll still have some, but not to the level, especially with the underutilization of fabs. So, all of those mixed in, we're going to -- we will have gotten most of our cost downs in the first half of the year, and then we'll see them come back as we ramp up BiCS6 and especially BiCS8.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. If I could follow up, Wissam, can you confirm that for the March quarter is just $150 million incremental underutilization charges? And then how are you thinking about that rolling off through calendar '23. Thank you so much.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. C.J., so the -- for the March quarter, we're projecting $250 million in total. That's between both Flash and HDD. We expect the probably, I would say, 3/4 of those to be in the Flash -- on the flash side and 1/4 in the HDD business. As we roll into the fourth quarter, I expect HDD to become minimal. But Flash will depend on how long we continue with the underutilization. The way to think of it is typically we -- as we under or as sort of we reduce the wafer starts, given the cycle time, we expect approximately 60% to 70% of the impact to come in the first, let's say, 90 days and then the remaining impact would be in the following quarter. So, the way to think of it is the March quarter would have around 60% to 70% of the impact from the underutilization for -- that we've taken -- the actions we've taken so far. Now that said, it could be that, depending on how the demand picture evolves, we haven't yet decided how long the underutilization is going to be, and we'll manage this in a very dynamic way as we continue to look at market inputs and so on. My comments were around assuming, let's say, a one-quarter event.
Operator: And our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking my question. I'll try to slip in two as well here real quick. First of all, on the 30% reduction of the wafer starts starting in early January. I'm just curious in the context of what you had outlined, you still -- it sounds like I think that NAND Flash bit demand growth is somewhere in the 20% plus range. With that 30% reduction, how has your bit production changed as you look at calendar '23, how much -- what's your assumption as far as your own bit supply growth as we move forward?
David Goeckeler: So first of all, let me talk about the kind of how we're thinking about it. It is a very dynamic situation. I think when we were looking at our CQ1, we've seen some demand drops. We've come off a very strong quarter of bit growth. We just delivered 20% sequential bit growth. That's why we didn't cut wafers earlier. When we look at our fiscal Q3, we're seeing some drop in both client and enterprise. The enterprise SSD side of it is more a digestion issue. So, to make sure we manage our inventory and we don't get things to build up. And so that's why we're -- we've decided to cut wafer starts in the first quarter.  Again, as Wissam said, that's a -- it's literally a decision we can make every week about how do we load wafers into the fab. Right now, that's a one quarter decision to make sure we keep our supply and demand balanced as best we can. I see Wissam looking up -- do you have a number on the overall bit growth for the year.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. I think the -- from a supply perspective, I would say, it will be in the lower -- I would say, it's probably given the CapEx situation, we're looking at this to be in the single-digit growth from a supply perspective.
Aaron Rakers: That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, on the hard disk drive side, I mean, looking at 61 exabyte capacity shift, that's down 40%, 45% sequential. What gives you the confidence that, that's just a transitory digestion thing? And maybe there isn't anything going on competitively? Just any kind of visibility you want to share in that business?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think we signaled this a little bit last quarter. We knew there was going to be some variability in demand across the industry and across customers. Quite frankly, when you're at these revenue levels, which are the lowest we've seen in the long time, orders from big customers make a very big difference.  So, if you go back for the last couple of quarters, the way different big cloud customers, the way either LTAs were restructured, the way big orders came in one way or another, you're seeing some pretty large share shifts quarter-over-quarter. But when you look at it on a sex month basis, you look at it on a 12-month basis, you see pretty consistent share. I think we've gained a little bit. But again, we're managing for profitability. We think share is going to be over a multi-quarter period, pretty stable, and that's actually the way it's working out, you're just seeing some pretty big swings here quarter-over-quarter. So, we feel really good about the competitive situation. The 22 terabyte drive shipped significant volume this quarter. We expect to ramp that throughout the year. We've got big customers very committed to SMR. Our UltraSMR technology gives us a unique position of an additional 20% gain over CMR. And that is in qualification across a number of very large customers. So, we feel like as we ramp throughout calendar year '23, we ramp into a stronger and stronger portfolio as we move through the year.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore : Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics of the underutilization charge. Is that sort of the cost of just higher cost per bit because you're running underutilized? Or are you -- I mean it sounds like you're pulling some of that forward in time, but maybe not all of it. Can you just talk about what exactly that charge will represent and how that's going to play out this quarter and next?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Sure, Joe. I should have clarified when I talked about the underutilization that we don't necessarily have a similar approach to the accounting for underutilization as some of our peers. For us, the underutilization charges are taken as a period expense. And so, any portion of the factory that's not being utilized is basically expensed within the quarter. And so, it does not flow through the inventory and back to the P&L, if that helps.
Joe Moore : Okay. It does. I guess, how are you guys thinking about the signals of like when that goes back to full utilization? I mean do you wait for pricing to stabilize? Or is there something you can see beforehand that will tell you and it's time to kind of keep to move the fab back to full.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Well, we're always talking to our customers, right? So, we have a very good sense of where they're at and what the demand signals are going to be. I mean as we talked about, we expect volumes to increase going into our fiscal fourth quarter. So, as we get closer to that and we understand what that looks like we'll make an incremental decision on when and how to ramp back up the fab.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Jason on for Tim from UBS. I have a couple of questions. So, my first question is on your -- on the NAND segment. Sorry if I misunderstood, but I believe you said single-digit bit growth for NAND in calendar year '23. So, I was just curious which end markets are driving this demand weakness this year. Also, I was just curious whether we should expect any potential risk for NAND inventory write-downs in March quarter or June quarter. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So, Jason, my comment was around the supply side. I would say, single digit, let's call it, high single-digit percentage growth. I didn't necessarily make any comments on the demand side. On the demand side, it'll probably be in the low 20% range in calendar '23 versus calendar '22.  As for the second part of your question, which is related to inventory. Look, we go through the process at the end of every quarter as part of our quarter close. We look at the various demand signals versus the inventory on hand and the costs, et cetera. And we're comfortable with where we ended at the end of calendar Q4.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And my second question is, apart from your comment on the utilization charges, do you guys also see any potential additional risk or purchase order cancellation fees for any type of pay agreements you have with your suppliers if it remains weak in the near term? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: I mean we typically don't forecast these things and we manage the business in a dynamic way. So, I don't expect anything major there.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Again, going back to Wissam's prior comment, that's part of our normal quarterly close process. And if there were any adjustments that were needed to be made, we would have made them at that time. But of course, you got to remeasure it and take a look at it every quarter.
Operator: And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. To first one, David, you mentioned nearline HDD could improve. I'm kind of curious how to think about pricing trends for nearline HDD in the March and June quarter? And also think about the nearline exabyte growth in the first half of this year in calendar '23 overall. And then I had a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think the pricing environment has been pretty good throughout this whole cycle. I mean any time you're seeing this kind of underutilization, you're going to see a little bit of pressure on pricing, which is not surprising, I would say we're seeing a little bit more. I mean I think as we look at exabyte growth is -- I think it's pretty clear to say it will be stronger in the second half than the first half. I mean we're going to now ramp back off of this very low in calendar Q4, and we expect growth as we move throughout the calendar year. As we said, we're anticipating modest revenue growth, maybe low to mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter here going into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, we expect margin improvement is, of course, the volume comes back and the underutilization charges drop, and we'll see that continue as we go throughout the calendar year. So -- but we are coming off of very low levels. I think that exabyte growth in the full calendar year will probably be below 20%, something around that. But again, we got to see how it plays out. We got -- we still got big customers going through inventory digestion, some are coming out of it. We'll know more as we work our way through the calendar quarter. And we also have a very dynamic situation in China. The China market has been very subdued for quite a long time now. I would say there are some signs of things getting better. We'll see after we get past the new year, how that progresses. But that could be that -- depending on how that comes back, will have an impact as well, of course.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just kind of curious, you mentioned the cloud inventory digestion. And you also mentioned that for HDD in March, the cloud business stabilized. So curious on the NAND side or even HDD side, when do you expect this digestion to bottom? And then when you think things start improving from a demand standpoint or maybe your own inventory standpoint. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. That's a very difficult question given how dynamic the market is. I mean I think we're coming off of a very strong quarter of bit growth, 20% sequential bit growth in our FQ2 was a good result. Obviously, it's a very challenging pricing environment. Going into our fiscal third quarter, we see a drop in both bits and pricing. So that's a pretty significant impact on the business. And then current forecast is going into our fiscal Q4, we see the volume pick back up. So that's a little bit a little bit of how we see the dynamics. The pricing environment will change as supply and demand come more into balance. And we're doing everything we can to manage our supply situation, demand balance so that we keep our inventory situation under control, very important in this kind of cycle. And we'll continue to be very dynamic of how we manage it. It literally changes week over week. And again, one of the things I'm very happy about what we've built in the organization over the last several years is a tremendous amount of agility in the organization to react. It's important that we react faster than the market is moving. Otherwise, we just get carried along with the market. And I think we're doing a good job with that to get the best result we can out of a difficult market and prepare ourselves from a technology and portfolio position that when things get more in balance and we get to the inevitable upturn that we're very, very well positioned, and we feel good about that from Flash technology. I talked about BiCS8. Again, we'll talk more about that throughout the quarter. I think you're going to be impressed about the innovation that's in that. I certainly was and also about where we're at in the product portfolio.
Operator: And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you. If I could just follow up on your comment on underutilization charges will be minimal in HDDs in fiscal 4Q. What's giving you the confidence there that this inventory digestion and particularly in the high cap price will largely be done? I know you're coming off low levels, but it also seems like some of the broader cloud customers are starting to tick down as well in terms of their own demand. So, any color you can share on what you're seeing in the market that's giving you the confidence that those underutilization charges will go away in HDDs by fiscal 4Q. And I have a follow-up.
Wissam Jabre: Well, let me start with the answer, Wamsi. When we look at our inventory exiting the fourth quarter, our inventory appears to be in a better position than our peers. And so obviously, when we consider the utilization and where the demand is and the improvement in demand over time on the HDD side, that's really what drove my comment. And so, based on what we see today, this is how we anticipate things to unfold.
Wamsi Mohan: Ok, thanks Wissam. And Dave, you noted in your prepared remarks a lot of different things that you're doing all the things that are kind of under your control, right, negotiating covenants, cutting costs, lowering CapEx, OpEx. And despite all of these, you are sort of doing these converts. So maybe you can just talk about why this incremental liquidity is needed as your view on the market changed materially or your share assumptions changed materially? Or is this more of a strategic investment and just optionality? Just -- maybe any color you can share around that would be helpful.
David Goeckeler: Yes. It's a number of things. So first of all, it is to give us the flexibility to manage through the depths of the downturn. It's important that we look at -- we have a blend of different kind of financing, both debt and equity. We can't just take all debt. We've got to watch our debt to equity our EBITDA to debt ratios and make sure we manage it all as one package. And I think so that's part of it. A big part of it is kind of facilitating the execution of our strategic review. These. You'll see in the 8-Ks that are filed. These agreements are very complicated and they're very well thought through to give us the ability to execute a range of outcomes and make sure that we can be in a good position as we move to that stage of the process of not putting a time line on that, but these are set up in a way that give us a lot of optionality and flexibility to facilitate that outcome. And then third thing it brings additional capability to our company. Reed Raymond is a very sophisticated technology investor that will join our Board. Elliott will have the right to join our Board under an amended letter agreement with them when they clear some issues at their choice.  So, it brings a lot of capability to us as well. So, we feel good about people investing in the business about the opportunity to do this, and it puts us in a very strong position to continue to execute the business, invest in innovation as well as set ourselves up for the next phase of our strategic review.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I have a follow-up to the last question and then an additional question. I just want to -- should we assume that you're not going to initially draw down the term loan that you have and that's kind of an insurance policy? And how should we -- I'm just trying to figure out interest expense on that. And then I have a follow-up.
Wissam Jabre: Yes, Shannon. So, the one thing to keep in mind is the -- we still have the IRS settlement payment that's expected to be in the fourth quarter. And so, when the time comes for that, we will make a decision based on what's the most efficient way to pay. If we don't need to draw down on our new facility, then we won't do that because obviously, the additional investment also gives us flexibility and optionality from a liquidity perspective.
Shannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then I'm curious, what changes are you looking at to get down to OpEx at about $600 million a quarter just as you look across your cost basis? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So, when you look at where we ended the December quarter, we were down versus also the September quarter, which was also down versus the previous quarter. So, in other words, from the beginning of the fiscal year until now, we've taken down approximately $100 million. And we guided to be $600 million to $620 million. We continue to take similar actions going through the typical focusing on exiting or reducing all sorts of discretionary expenses. But more importantly, we're basically focusing on maintaining the critical R&D investments so that we continue to invest in our technology and drive the long-term growth. So more of a similar type of actions as we've taken so far. And that should get us close to the $600 million and below that by the end of the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thomas O'Malley: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the preferred equity convert. We've seen different companies handle them from a dilution perspective where sometimes even out of the money, you'll see them come into the non-GAAP share count. Can you just talk about what you're expecting from dilution there and how you're handling that and the guidance given I really don't see shares getting moved around at all? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: So, Tom, maybe I'll start with the latter part of your question. as we're guiding for a share loss for this quarter, including the dilution of the preferred -- the convert would be anti-dilutive. And so that's why you don't see them reflected in the share count. However, as we swing to a profit, I would expect us to include them as part of our fully diluted share count. So, they'll have some limited dilution impact.
Thomas O'Malley: Helpful. And then just on the recovery side into the fourth quarter on some of the bit shipments or the [indiscernible] can you just -- are you just thinking that it will inflect higher? Or are you expecting a material step-up because you outperformed your peers in the December quarter with the growth you saw there. You're obviously expecting a step down in March. But just talk about the cadence. Is it an extreme step down in March with a small step up? Any kind of color on how you're looking at that forecast given you're giving some color there.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think one of the things we're seeing is one of our big enterprise SSD customers go through a digestion phase in our FQ3 and I think they'll get through that in a quarter and be back to buying. So that should be -- that will get back to a good guy instead of a bad guy as far as the volume. And then we'll -- this is a very seasonally weak quarter for consumers. So, we'll see some step-up there. Client is a little bit TBD is now commercial and enterprise is a little weaker. The consumer side has stabilized. So, I don't want to put too much of qualification on it. But again, we feel good about our ability to have a very diverse portfolio, very diverse go to market engine. We've talked about this from the channel to consumer to the big OEMs to the web players. And I think, quite frankly, we saw last quarter that go to market engine performed really well. And when we get past a few seasonality things and a few things that are idiosyncratic with big customers, we'll see it kick back in and perform well.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.
David Goeckeler: Hi, Jim.
Jim Suva: Thank so much, David. It sounds like with the charge of $250 million now, and you mentioned NAND underutilization starts to kind of go away in Q4. That kind of you're seeing a bottom or the worst of the utilization charges kind of in the March quarter. Is that fair to say? I know you still have to do some adjustments for NAND and wafers based upon how the market goes. But is that fair to say kind of the worst of it and the digestion and equilibrium are kind of hitting in the March quarter? 
Wissam Jabre: So, Jim, thanks for the question. My comment around underutilization going away was more related to the HDD side of the business. On the flash side or on the NAND side, I would say it is a dynamic situation. We will continue to assess as we see the demand signal coming. And so, the example I gave earlier was on the assumption that we don't -- that we have only one quarter of underutilization. I wanted to make sure that's well described, so that -- for modeling purposes. But yes, the comment around underutilization disappearing was mostly related to the hard drive side. And look, on the NAND side, also when we exited Q4, we -- our inventory position was better than some of our peers. And we're taking this action to continue to manage our inventory given where the demand picture is today. but that's an evolving situation, and we will be -- we can -- as David said, this is a decision that we can take on a weekly basis if we need to change the approach.
Jim Suva: Thanks, Wissam and David for the details. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you. I was wondering -- I wanted to talk about NAND for a second. Does the capital infusion from the convertible stock and draw on your revolver change your approach to ramping BiCS6 and BiCS8. I asked because 90 days ago, you indicated you'd be pushing out to BiCS transition to reduce your CapEx for fiscal '23. But today, you're also indicating BiCS6 will reach cost crossover with BiCS5 in March, and you're also currently in production of BiCS8. And so, I guess, specifically, when should we expect BiCS8 should reach volume crossover to your NAND business? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I don't think we're that far along to say -- to issue that kind of guidance, I guess, I would call that. But I think what we're saying is BiCS8 is well along in its technology evolution and it's reached production phase like I said -- I wish we had -- on video, I can show you the BiCS8 product I'm holding in my hands and playing with. But yes, I would say the investment doesn't change the way we're thinking about our supply situation. What we're trying to do is match our supply situation to our demand and make sure we can manage our inventory and it doesn't get out of control as we go through this process. We're trying to be very dynamic.  And obviously, when you're slowing down the fab. And one of the ways to do that is to slow down the nodal transition. It brings in this whole question of how long we're going to stay on BiCS6, how fast do we transition to BiCS8. And we're working through all of that. Again, that's a bit dynamic. A lot of it depends on what BiCS8 looks like and how it's being productized. And I think one of the things we're seeing here today is it has reached the productization stage ahead of schedule. And so, we'll have more to say about what that fab mix looks like as we go forward. It's clear we're going to have BiCS6 will be a shorter node. It won't go into every single product if it will go into the products that it needs and then we'll move other products straight to BiCS8.
Karl Ackerman: I appreciate that. If I may because you are discussing an improvement in HDDs beginning in March, could you discuss whether you need to take further action to rightsized your own inventory of components? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: The quick answer to this, Karl, is we don't see the need to do that. And so, this is why we don't project it. We continue to manage the inventory situation on a dynamic basis. But as of the end of the quarter, we were comfortable on where we are. And from where I stand today, we don't see the need to do that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Bryant: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on that last question about the inventories. Can you expand on the strategy from here? Because I'm looking at your inventory days and they're up from 102 a year ago to 133 days. And you mentioned there's still some demand question. So, I'm trying to understand why start ramping back HDDs next quarter versus taking an inventory write-down versus other strategies to sort of get your inventories in better alignment and generate some better cash flows? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: So, let me maybe just clarify on the HDD side, to be clear, when we look at the inventory movement in the December quarter that just ended, we did reduce the HDD inventory quite a bit. In fact, the increase came from the Flash side. So, when we look at the numbers, I think quarter-to-quarter at the company level, we saw around $90 million reduction in inventories. And those were more than $200 million of reduction was in the HDD side. That was partly offset by some of the growth in Flash. And so, we don't think the inventory situation on the hard drive side is bad. We obviously will continue to monitor as we do on a regular basis. We also are, as part of the $250 million underutilization that we talked about for the March quarter, there are some continued underutilization on the hard drive side, which would allow us to continue to manage inventory very tightly and maintain that discipline on the supply side until, obviously, the demand growth accelerates.  And that's what my comment was about the next quarter, not necessary, in other words, the June quarter, not necessarily seeing as much of hard drive underutilization charges. I hope this clarifies.
Steven Bryant: Yes. No, that definitely helps filling some of the blanks. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, Steven.
Operator: And our last question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: A couple of quick ones. On the gross margin side, if I think about fiscal third quarter, if hard drive underutilization charges goes down quarter-over-quarter and revenue goes up modestly, is it fair to assume that gross margins for hard drive goes up. And if that's the case, does that mean NAND gross margin could go below zero in the quarter. Obviously, there's a onetime charge involved.
Wissam Jabre: So, Sidney, this is a fair way of looking at the transition from Q2 to Q3 with the improved utilization or, let's say, smaller -- lesser underutilization on the hard drive side, we expect to see some improvement in the gross margin quarter-to-quarter. And unfortunately, with the high underutilization charge related to the 30% supply cut on the Flash side, we're anticipating the gross margin there to be slightly negative. And so that sums it up.
Sidney Ho: Great. And then my quick follow-up here is just maybe you have covered this already. But how would you characterize the inventory level in the channel and the customers for both hard drive and Flash. It sounds like hard drive is in decent shape. But curious, more curious on the flash side.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I would say it's -- actually, the channel has been pretty good on the client -- on SSDs this past quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in the channel. I think the channel performance has been -- was actually one of the bright spots last quarter. So, I don't think we see anything too unusual there.
Sidney Ho: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Sidney. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Take care. 
Wissam Jabre: Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-10-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Western Digital First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Andrew. Please go ahead.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends, and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 first quarter results. I am pleased to see the Western Digital team work together to deliver revenue at the upper half of the guidance range in the midst of an incredibly dynamic and challenging macroeconomic environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $307 million. Our operating income performance was above the midpoint implied by our guidance and demonstrated our ability to actively respond and navigate this environment. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and included an approximately $0.30 impact due to higher than forecasted tax rate. Overall, the actions we have taken over the past few years are enabling us to manage through business cycle troughs more effectively and position the company to thrive as market conditions improve. These efforts have reinvigorated the Western Digital innovation engine and strengthened our product portfolio. In particular, we are leading the transition to SMR-based hard drives alongside our cloud customers, showcasing our product leadership. In flash, we have nearly tripled our bit shipments in the NVMe enterprise SSD product category as compared to the last down cycle, adding another large and growing end market in which we can allocate our flash bits. Our industry-leading innovation, diversified portfolio and broad go-to-market strategy across cloud, client and consumer end markets allow us to enjoy strong relationships with our customers and meet the full range of storage needs. The breadth of markets we address also offers us unique visibility into end market demand signals, which allowed us to recognize potential challenges to our business as they unfolded. We have proactively and effectively managed our business through weakening consumer demand by optimizing product mix and rightsizing our hard drive manufacturing footprint. As part of these efforts to manage through this part of the cycle, we are reducing our capital investments and operating expenses as we move to align our cash flow and cost structure with market conditions. Wissam will go over our efforts in more detail. As we closely monitor the macro environment, we are encouraged to see retail flash and channel demand leveling out and orders from PC customers stabilizing, a sign that consumer-led inventory correction is abating. We believe the long-term growth in flash demand, combined with reduced flash industry supply will restore supply and demand balance in the next couple of quarters. Before I jump into updates on our HD and Flash businesses, I want to provide a short update on our strategic review process. The executive committee of our Board, which I lead, continues its process, which I previously announced includes the participation of Elliott Management under a non-disclosure agreement. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today. We will provide updates as we have them. Now turning to our HDD business. During the first quarter, our HDD revenue declined modestly as we had forecasted in August. Sequentially, total HDD and nearline exabyte shipments were both flat. Continued momentum with U.S. cloud customers and accelerated adoption of SMR hard drives were offset by softness in other capacity enterprise product channels and consumer HDD demand. Shipment of capacity enterprise drives based on SMR technologies exceeded 25% of this category, one quarter ahead of our expectations. We now expect SMR to represent over 40% of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipment exiting fiscal year 2023. SMR adoption drove a 19% sequential and 21% year-over-year increase in average capacity to 17 terabytes per capacity enterprise drive, and our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments increased more than 150% sequentially. We are deep into the process of qualifying our latest generation of hard drives, including our 26 terabyte UltraSMR hard drives at multiple U.S. cloud and OEM customers. Interest in SMR from other hyperscalers worldwide is increasing as the 20% capacity gain offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. Looking ahead, our U.S. cloud customers have started sharply reducing their hard drive inventory alongside other components for their data center build-outs. This, along with continued subdued demand across markets in China, will impact near-term demand over the next few quarters. Despite these near-term corrections, it is clear from our conversations with these customers that HDD products will be the foundational storage for their continued cloud build-out in the years to come. Our product leadership and innovation engine remain as strong as ever and we are confident that Western Digital's hard drive business will thrive over the long-term as demand improves and new products continue to ramp. Turning to flash. Revenue was slightly ahead of our expectations. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading brands, including WD Black, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional that are recognized globally for their cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. I'm pleased to say that we exceeded our bit shipment forecast this quarter. Our client SSD products for PC OEM, retail and mobile drove the upside in bit shipments. Average capacity per client SSD increased 24% sequentially and 54% year-over-year, driven by doubling of standard storage capacity for PCs sold by multiple OEMs. This is another reminder of the insatiable demand for data storage and the resilience of flash demand as price elasticity drives increased consumption per device. On the technology front, BiCS5 accelerated to over two thirds of our flash revenue in the September quarter, up from about half in the previous quarter. BiCS6 yield and development of subsequent 3D NAND flash are both progressing well. For the December quarter, we expect flash shipments to increase sequentially, led by seasonal strength in retail and mobile. With the abrupt change in market conditions, we are acting decisively to adjust our supply trajectory to align with demand. We are pushing out BiCS6 transition to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 which may offer us a potential opportunity to leapfrog to a future BiCS technology node as demand normalizes. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our first quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter.
Wissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, revenue was in line, thanks to our team's agility and resilience in managing through this dynamic environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 17% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and, as David mentioned, included an approximately $0.30 impact due to the higher than forecasted tax rate. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 49% of revenue at $1.8 billion, down 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, continued momentum in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers and an increase in smart video hard drive demand partly offset the decline in all other hard drive product channels and flash. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments were flat at 112 exabytes, driven by our success in leading the industry transition to SMR hard drives. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline across both hard drive and flash products. Clients represented 33% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 25% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was attributed to flash driven by inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower pricing. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduced flash pricing. Lastly, consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.7 billion, down 15% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue decline was due to flash pricing and lower retail HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $2 billion, down 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, total HDD exabyte shipments increased by 1% and average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $125. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 12% and average price per unit increased by 23%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 28% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 22% on a blended basis and 17% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 10% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 26.7%, down 5.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 28.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down 2.4 percentage points year-over-year. Our flash gross margin was 24.5%, down 11.4 percentage points sequentially and 12.5 percentage points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $689 million, down $71 million sequentially and below our guidance range due to lower variable expenses and tighter expense management, including reduction of discretionary spending. Operating income was $307 million, representing a 56% decrease from the prior quarter and a 68% decrease year-over-year. As David mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered operating income above the midpoint implied by our guidance in a challenging market backdrop. Our tax expense was $168 million, resulting in a tax rate of 72% higher than previously forecasted. Tax expense is influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was $0.20 compared to $1.78 in the prior quarter and $2.49 in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $6 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $215 million. Cash capital expenditures, which includes the purchase of property, plant, equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $221 million. Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.1 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.7x compared to 2x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I would like to discuss the business outlook for the balance of this fiscal year and the actions we are taking to align our execution plan with the changes in business environment. In flash, we expect shipments to increase sequentially in the fiscal second quarter and the balance of the fiscal year 2023 as the market stabilizes. In HDD, we expect our revenue to recover as our U.S. cloud customers reduced their inventories over the next two quarters. On the manufacturing front, we have sharply reduced client hard drive production capacity by approximately 40%. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to $2.7 billion. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure by 20% versus our prior expectation. The main drivers of our lower capital expenditures are primarily the push out of BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investments in hard drive manufacturing. As for our operating expenses, we proactively reduced our spending by approximately $80 million in the first fiscal quarter relative to the midpoint of the guidance range. We are also taking further action to lower our ongoing operating expenses range to $650 million to $700 million as we navigate this dynamic environment. We believe these actions we are taking will allow us to continue to invest in innovation as a top priority for our company going forward. For the fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 20% and 22%. We expect operating expenses to be between $650 million and $670 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $80 million. We expect the tax benefit between $70 million and $90 million. We expect loss per share of $0.25 to earnings per share of $0.05 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me briefly wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. While near-term market conditions are challenging, digital transformation continues to drive long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With products and solutions that play in every part of the technology ecosystem, Western Digital can meet customers' needs across the spectrum and unlock the possibilities of data. For example, while we are successfully managing through the consumer-led downturn, which is showing signs of stabilization, we are ramping multiple new products into data centers worldwide. As we remain focused on innovation and execution, I am optimistic that Western Digital will emerge stronger as we continue to ramp multiple new products into data centers worldwide and market conditions improve. With our top-tier team innovative and diversified portfolio, broad customer base and differentiated go-to-market engine, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities stemming from the rapid global adoption of the cloud and the expansive and growing ecosystem it supports. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work during this quarter and for solidifying our leadership in storage. In the face of an extremely challenging macro environment, our team worked together to deliver solid financial performance for Western Digital. I’m proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in calendar 2023 and beyond. All right, Peter. With that, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go into the Flash business and kind of parse out kind of how you're thinking about the gross margin trajectory into the December quarter guidance? And specifically, within that, your JV partner, Kioxia announced a couple of weeks ago that they were going to cut production by as much as 30%. I'm curious your gross margin expectations. Have you taken any actions to take out production? And with that, any underutilization charges that are baked into your expectations into the December quarter? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Aaron, good morning. And thanks for the question. We have not taken any major underutilization actions in the fab. We always reserve that right in the future, depending on market conditions. So when we look at our – the way to think about Q4, and I'll invite calendar Q4, Wissam, obviously, make some comments. I mean we're still under a – pricing is still under pressure. I think that's fairly clear what's going on in the market. And then we've got a sequential increase, slight increase in bit shipments. So think that's one way to think about how we're thinking about the quarter. Wissam, anything to add?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. The only thing – I mean, I think the only thing I would add, David, is yes, pricing is pretty much what's going to be the main driver of gross margin in the calendar Q4.
Aaron Rakers: And then as a quick follow-up on the hard disk drive, the nearline, it sounds like you and your competitors are going through some digestion at some of your CSP partners. What's the expectation for the December quarter? It sounds like you expect – is the expectation is that shipments start to improve going into the March quarter at this point? And then I'll see the floor. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, we're going to – you've got it. We're going to see a sharp decline in shipments in calendar Q4 and that's going to lead to some pretty significant absorption charges or underutilization charges. And then will grow back out of that as we move into – as we move through 2023.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-up to the prior first question around NAND. I was hoping you could speak maybe more broadly around your NAND bit allocation strategy. You spoke to no underutilization charges today. I think your NAND gross margins, obviously moving lower. And in the last cycle, I think in 2019, we troughed at 19%, so curious, how are you thinking about what business you'll take, what you won't take and how that will impact, whether desire to build inventory and/or choose to cut utilization at some point.
David Goeckeler: Good morning. So I think this is – the strategy we've been executing over the last couple of years and what we've been talking about, I think, is really paying off for us now at this part of the cycle. We've worked very hard to drive the portfolio abroad and deep portfolio across consumer, across mobile. We obviously still stay qualified at all the vendors, the client SSD portfolio is an anchor of the portfolio, gaming. And now we've added enterprise SSD into the mix. So we've always talked about – we want to have a broad portfolio to be qualified everywhere we can. And then be able to mix based on what gets us to the best return. And so I think at this part of the cycle, we're able to do that. And it also gives us quite a few homes for our supply. So that allows us in a tough quarter, have sequential bit growth. Obviously, pricing is market-based pricing. So we participate in the market and it allows us to basically just change the mix to get the best return we can. So again, I think the portfolio strategy we've been pursuing and we've been talking about getting qualified at the hyperscalers on enterprise SSD, and that is – that gives us another really important home for our supply. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think when you look across the portfolio, we have five or six categories, depending on the quarter, if you look at it for the whole fiscal year, we'll have six different categories where we have a double-digit mix of bits going into those different parts of the market. So I think it gives us a lot of optionality and the ability to generate the best return we can.
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. I guess, a follow-up on your technology road map. You talked about theoretically potentially skipping a node. And historically, players in the market have not done very well when they pursue that strategy. So I guess, can you kind of walk through what gives you the confidence that, that's something that would make sense for you guys, just given the historical precedents?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think the way we think about it right now, BiCS6 is – we're taking the actions around capital investment to slow down our bit supply in the market to try and get the market balance. I think everybody is doing that. There's really an enormous number of actions to try and get the market back in balance. We feel good about those. We'll take effect next year as we move through the year. What it means for us is BiCS6 will be a shorter node. At this point, the follow-on node BiCS8 is progressing very, very well. And as we move through the year, we'll be able to make a judgment about how long we're going to stay on which node. There's a number of issues around qualifications of products and all those kinds of things. So we'll make thoughtful decisions about that when we get closer to that point as we move through 2023. But we feel very good about where both nodes are and how they're progressing and that will give us the – give us, again, more optionality about how we think about what products we put in the market to get us the best financial return and obviously, the best solution for our customers.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Sounds like you guys are pretty optimistic that this improves. But I guess in the event that it doesn't, if earnings stay at this level for a few quarters or get worse, it looks like you might be challenged on the leverage ratio. We've talked to a bunch of people in credit, and it sounds like that's a relatively easy amendment to make that there's no strain to it, if you do it quickly. So just wondering how are you thinking about that? Are you – and then just sort of broader, more philosophically, it feels like it's going to be a tough economic year next year, there could be a lot of challenges. But with Chinese supply out of the mix, the next NAND cycle should be pretty exciting. So I feel like as you think about more negative scenarios, how do you think about weathering the storm and making sure that the kind of $15 of earnings power you did a few years ago is something we might see in the future?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. Good morning, Joe, thanks for the question. So with respect to the first part of your question, look, we're – we entered this down cycle in a very much stronger financial position than the previous one. If you recall, we reduced our debt by $2.7 billion. We've improved the earnings power of the business. We strengthened our portfolio. And also, if you look at our liquidity at the end of Q1, we had around $4.3 billion between a little bit more than $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the $2.25 billion revolver that's undrawn. So we have ample liquidity to operate within the – in the next few quarters. And from where we are now, we're very comfortable in terms of the continued profitability of the business.
David Goeckeler: Joe, and just to add to that, I mean, we're thinking about how you are. I mean, look, we've got a – we've got to get through this phase of the cycle. I think there's been a lot of discussion about everything from reduced utilization to pushing out CapEx. To your point, there are some regulations that are going to impact supply in the market in 2023. So we're optimistic about the next cycle about getting there. The market is all the – we're reacting strongly to get supply and demand back in balance. But we – as Wissam said, we've invested in our balance sheet – we've invested in innovation in our portfolio to build the resiliency and the agility in the business to manage through this.
Joe Moore: Okay, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on the NAND business as well. So David, based on the CapEx decisions you've made over the past couple of months, how should we think about your bit supply growth in, say, calendar 2023. Obviously, you've got bids on your balance sheet. But on a manufacturing basis, given the decisions you've made, how should we think about bit supply growth. And it seems like you're not cutting production like many of your other peers. I guess, my question is, why not? Is that a function of the contaminant issue earlier in the year and you're looking to regain some ground? Or is there something else? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: No, it's – on the second part of your question, it's not because of that at all. It's because we have a lot of homes for our supply, and we're able to get, we think, a good economic return for that. So from – just purely from an economic point of view, it makes sense for us to continue to build the supply. We're definitely going to slow down our bit supply. I think you can think like low to mid-20s for supply next year is kind of the way we're thinking about it.
Toshiya Hari: Okay, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to your initial comments around consumer stabilization. I know you alluded to some points around retail and PC orders. And I was hoping that you can maybe double click a little bit on what you're seeing both in retail and PC orders, specifically. And also perhaps touch on your expectation of inventory levels exiting the December quarter. Thank you so much.
David Goeckeler: So let me take the first part, and I'll ask Wissam to comment on inventory. If we go back and we look at kind of the progression of what's happened this year. Back in March, we – roughly the March time frame, we saw the consumer market come under pressure. We talked a lot about that. In let's call it, the June time frame, we saw the PC OEMs really start adjusting their inventory very aggressively. We talked about that last quarter. And we've seen that play out during the quarter now in a number of different fronts. And then just within the last month or two, we've started to see the big data center operators do the same thing, really sharply adjust their inventory. And obviously, that's factored into our guide. So we've seen this kind of rolling change as it goes through one market to the next. If you look at the other side of it, where are they at in that process, consumer market, we're seeing relatively predictable behavior, it's not like it's at a great point, but it's not falling the way it was, our ability to predict where it's going to be week-over-week and month-over-month have increased. And so we've got more confidence we understand where that market is at and how it's going to play out going forward. In the PC market and see Q4, we're actually going to see some sequential growth in units of client SSD, not a huge amount, but it's sequential growth. Again, we talked about a very, very sharp inventory correction. So we're starting to see – we're getting to the point there where the inventory correction last quarter was quite severe. I mean, when customers going down to less than 10% of their usual demand. Now we see things coming back and stabilizing a little bit. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that things are back up and back up and to the right, but they're stabilizing a bit, and we're starting to see some signs that we're getting more predictable behavior and then that we can then grow out at this point. Obviously, the data center, the big U.S. hyperscalers were just kind of going into that. And we'll have more to say as we – it's going to be a couple of quarters, but we'll have more to say as we go through the quarter of what we're seeing and then what we see going into next quarter. Inventory?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. And on the second part of the question, Wamsi. In Q1, we saw approximately a couple of hundred million dollars of growth in inventory at the end of the quarter. Our days of inventory were at 128. We're expecting to see a similar type of trends in the calendar Q4, roughly speaking, let's say, $100 million to $200 million growth and a bit of an increase in our days of inventory.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, I had a question, and then I had a clarification. So the question is on NAND cost. And the question really is sort of what the push out of BiCS6 does to your longer term? And when I say longer term, I mean like inside of calendar 2023 and into 2024, like what that does to your NAND cost curve? You've been bringing costs down mid-teens. I know it's going to be less than that next year. But what is the push out due to your cost curve? And then I wanted to clarify on the HDD margin assumption for December, can you sort of disaggregate a little bit what you think HDD margins will be for December like what's implied? It seems like gross margin is down to smidge that's being implied in your guidance? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes. On NAND cost, when we went through the CapEx exercise, we obviously kept a very close eye on still being able to drive cost declines. It's a very important element of the whole model of what we're doing here. So we're still comfortable with you modeling 15% year-over-year cost declines. I mean, clearly, there'll be some variability from quarter-to-quarter, but we still target that 15% year-over-year. It's a big part – I've talked about this a lot in the past. It's an actual input into the process, into the design process, not an output. And so we really designed to meet that, and it's a strong part of what we're – what the whole business is about. HDD margins will be under pressure next quarter. We will have – as I said before, we'll have some significant underutilization costs that will go into the financials – the other side of that is pricing in nearline and capacity enterprise has been stable benign about what we expect. But we're clearly going to have to – we're going to slow down production significantly, and that will hit us in the margin line next quarter. And then we'll grow out of that as volume comes back. And as we go through 2023, we also feel very – we feel very good that we're going to be ramping into the 22-terabyte drive, which is deep in qualification at a lot of different places around the world. And also the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drive is in qualification as well. And we talked a lot about SMR in the prepared remarks, that is a technology we believe very strongly. That's the next phase of the data center is SMR. And it was – just last quarter, we talked about ending the year with 25% of our exabytes in that market being SMR, we achieved that a quarter early. And now we expect to exit the fiscal year with over 40% of our exabytes being shipped on SMR. So I feel really good about where the portfolio is. And as we grow out of this sharp inventory correction through 2023, we'll be going into strength in the product road map.
Operator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just wondering, can you talk a bit about the pricing environment, both in NAND and drives. And how both – you expect the prices to move from an absolute basis and then also from a mixed basis, the 22, 26, et cetera comes out over time. I’m just wondering how we should sort of think about that. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Pricing in HTD has been something we’ve been very much focused on. We feel very, very positive about the innovation we’re bringing to market. I mean, that’s where all – everything about pricing starts with innovation. You got to bring a great product to market. You got to continue to drive a better value proposition for our customers. And we believe strongly we’re doing that. These new drives have very good TCO benefits for our – the largest data center operators in the world. So pricing in nearline has been, I think benign is the word I’ve used for many quarters now, and I would continue to use that word. And we’re going to be focused on value-based pricing as we ramp into 22 and 26. So that’s the way we’re thinking about it. Again, it’s all about driving a better TCO value proposition through innovation, and then we get to share that benefit of that with our customers. In NAND pricing has clearly been under pressure. I think that’s very well documented. As I said before that look at our pricing last quarter, like for like for like minus 17%, blended minus 22%, we’re clearly mixing this – the mix hurts the pricing a bit, but it also allows us to move a lot of supply. And we think it’s the right – we think it’s the right decision for the business. We expect pricing to be under pressure in calendar Q4 as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick one on SMR. Can you talk a little bit about how to think about SMR in terms of your revenue mix? And also how many customers you have? And are you seeing any nearline HDD share shifts because of the SMR position? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We don’t talk about specific customers. But what I can say is there’s multiple, very large customers committed to SMR, some of the largest data center operators in the world. And I think the whole industry is especially UltraSMR. I mean, SMR has been around a long time, right? SMR has been shipped and client drives for a long time, but it actually requires some work on the host side for the data center operators. So when we were able to introduce UltraSMR and get plus 20% on a CMR drive versus the industry standard of plus 10% that really changed the equation a bit. And when you can get 20% capacity uplift, it’s worth the investment on the host site. And we’re seeing that – we’re seeing that move across a lot of operators be very interested in that. So we don’t break out specific customers. I said on an exabyte basis, we expect it to be over 40% exiting the fiscal year. I think you can assume on a revenue basis, it’ll be slightly more than that. But I think that’s how we think about it.
Operator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I also have one question, two parts. Your wafer purchase based on cost plus and given continued weakness in NAND prices, how is that going to impact your margin? There was a reference earlier of a minimum margin of 19%, and I just want to make sure that we understand that there is that minimum gross margin given the fact that you actually purchase wafer from the JV. And on the HDD side, as you think about the dynamics, if we’re actually seeing the bottoming into next year, how are you planning for your capacity and what kind of exabyte growth are you forecasting for your HDD manufacturing capacity that you have online? And in other words, how are you thinking about your HDD capacity? What kind of assumption for shipment you have? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: All right, let me – I’ll make some comments here and then I’m sure Wissam will probably have something to add as well. So first of all, let’s clarify the comment on gross margin. There is no minimum gross margin. I think the comment was that in the last down cycle, the company’s gross margin bottomed at 19% in flash. I will note that that number did not include the underutilization charges. And when you include the underutilization charges, Wissam, I know we calculated this number.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. We’re in the sort of let’s say between the – it’s in the low teens.
David Goeckeler: Low teens, okay. So I think that was just a – Mehdi, I just think that was a benchmark that one of the previous questioners was using. So you’re right about how we get the – how the JV economics work. But again, our – the way we think about the portfolio is if we can get the – if we can – if we have a home for the bits, that’s number of – that’s the first thing like, do we have a place where we can – do we have customers that value our innovation in our portfolio and we have a place to put the supply and then we look at pricing and then we look at that equation and does it make economic sense to do that and we drive the portfolio. We’re actually given where we are in the cycle, we’re pleased with the gross margin we’re able to drive in the business at this point. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. Exabyte growth, I mean, clearly we’re going to slow down ACD exabyte growth. I think this – that the industry is going through a pretty large digestion cycle. Part of the CapEx pushout that we saw them talked about, the lion share of that is on the flash side of the business. But we’re also moving out ACD CapEx as well to slow down our exabyte growth there. We have a lot of conviction that the market’s still going to grow in that high 20, 30 plus range on exabyte growth, but we’re going to have to grow back into that as we go through this inventory correction.
Operator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the inventories 6% sequential growth and I know you guys expect more sequential growth in inventories this quarter. Is the build more flash or HDD driven? I’m talking about the September quarter. And then given the sharp pull back in clouds, you guys are cutting utilizations in HDD this quarter. But are you guys also holding back shipments of HDD in the December quarter? And then on the NAND side, despite the sequential growth for bits and flash, are you guys holding back some shipments in the December quarter?
Wissam Jabre: So let me take the question. So with respect to inventory in the September quarter the majority of the inventory growth was in NAND. On the HDD side, we were mostly flattish. As we look into the December quarter, we’re expecting to continue to see more NAND inventory growth and there will be some HDD inventory growth, but not as much as we are anticipating to see NAND growth there. And the HDD growth will be basically just driven by the weakness we’re seeing in the market. But also we will – we’re carefully managing our utilization. They will be under absorption costs. We’re also trying to carefully manage our utilization going forward. And in terms of the – the part of the question with respect to holding shipments no, we’re not planning to hold shipments.
Operator: The next question comes from Tom O’Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O’Malley: Hey, thanks for taking my question, guys. You guys have seen a pretty long stretchier of seeing HDD ASPs on the rise. Obviously with a lot of moving parts with the weakness that you’re seeing, could you guys comment on what you expect HDD ASPs as a whole? You report the number every quarter to do sequentially. Is it falling because of mix or is there any puts and takes that we need to be considering when we look at the December guide? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. The transition is primarily driven by mix. That’s a key driver for HDD.
Peter Andrew: Yes. So Tom, if you look at calendar Q4, you should expect ASP for HDDs to be down, mainly driven by mix as the hyperscale guys go through the digestion phase.
Tom O’Malley: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you. You mentioned Q4 will be burdened or December quarter will be burdened with underutilization charges. Is that kind of the brunt of it, the worst or the most amount to be absorbed there, and then we start to improve going after? Or does it continue? And you mentioned CapEx, you’re slowing that down. Could you quantify or give us some CapEx guidance about where we should kind of anticipate for CapEx and for modeling cash flow around CapEx? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So on the comment with respect to underutilization, yes, from where we stand today, this seems to be where we see probably underutilization at its lowest. And we would start getting ourselves out of that as demand improves. With respect to CapEx, we are aiming to reduce our cash CapEx for the fiscal year by 20%. Ideally we want to do more. The way to think of it is in our cash CapEx the 20% is roughly split around the 30% reduction with respect – and these are relative to our previous expectations. So 30% lower than previously expected on the NAND side. And on the HTD side, it’s a reduction of 10% to 15% relative to the previous expectations.
Operator: The next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the free cash flow expectation. What is your expectation for the December quarter and for fiscal 2023 and perhaps kind of trajectory of how things go? And maybe I’ll throw this one in too. When you look at the inventory still going up next quarter, are you concerned about inventory write-downs, especially given name gross margin? I think it was 25% probably going down for a couple more quarters. Thanks.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So Sidney, for free cash flow, we’re projecting a negative free cash flow in the December quarter and for the fiscal year. Keep in mind that we have the IRS settlement payment that is still projected to be in the fiscal 2023. And this was estimated at $600 million to $700 million. With respect to inventory, look, we did see a small impact in terms of write-down in the September quarter. Ultimately, it all depends on how the net pricing develops in the next few quarters. So it’s difficult to predict at this time, but it will depend on where the net pricing progresses.
Operator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question.
David Goeckeler: Good morning.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, good morning. Yeah, just interested in hearing what you’re seeing and what your thoughts are with regards to nearline demand from your OEM customers that might go to the on-premise spending.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I would say, those are under pressure as well. I mean, I think across the whole data center business, we see pressure on that part of the market, both from the OEM side and the hyperscalers. I would say the hyperscaler is a little more severe correction, but we’re seeing pressure on both sides of the data center business.
Operator: The next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss the run rate level of OpEx for the next few quarters. And as you address that question, how much of the $70 million improvement this quarter is from the 40% reduction in hard drive capacity versus changes in accounting for R&D in NAND? As well as, could you touch on your ability to redeploy heads in media production into cloud products where demand should grow very well on a structural basis going forward? Thank you.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So with respect to the run rate of OpEx when you look at – maybe I’ll talk a little bit about where we ended in Q1, because this is a bit relevant on how we think about it going forward. So in Q1 we saw an approximately $70 million to $80 million actually drop from the prior quarter. So we ended it around $689 million. We took action on variable expenses and non-discretionary spend. Basically we are tightening the – totally the expenses management. As we look forward for the next few quarters, the run rate is expected to be $650 million to $700 million. And we’re still contemplating few other actions that may help us keep things even tighter. So that’s the run rate. On the part of the question related to the client capacity restructuring, the OpEx does not reflect that. This mostly – the impact of that is mostly on the cost of goods sold. And with the reduction of approximately 40% of our capacity, we expect to see on an annual basis, roughly $45 million to $50 million benefit. So that’s roughly speaking a little bit more than $10 million, let’s call it around, $10 million to $12 million a quarter. In terms of the last part of the question on the heads and media, some of this capacity is fungible. And we can – part of our capital investment was to continue to invest in our heads and media to ensure we have the capacity to drive the – or supply the growth expected in the future. But as we talked about that, also we are managing our capital expenditures over the next few quarters to manage our cash.
David Goeckeler: I think you’ve got the headset right, which is in the transition from client to cloud, we move all the heads and media over to cloud. We’ve been in that transition for a long time. We’re very, very deep in that. I would say we’re in the last stages of that transition. So simple thing with client drives have a lot more discs and heads in them and we use all that capacity.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.
Mark Miller: Thank you for the question. You saw a decline in cash in the current quarter and you’re talking about negative free cash flow. Where do you think cash will be at the end of December quarter in the year?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So, I won’t necessarily guide to a cash number, but we’re expecting a negative free cash flow quarter in the calendar Q4. From a liquidity perspective, look, we ended the Q1 at $4.3 billion with around $2 billion of cash. And we still have $2.25 billion of revolver. And so from a liquidity perspective we’re comfortable in the ability for us to continue to operate comfortably.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Goeckeler for any closing remark.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thanks everyone for joining us. Look, we’ll be talking to all of you throughout the quarter. We appreciate your participation in the call. It’s obviously a very dynamic environment we’re all facing out there. Feel really good about the way we’ve been navigating this. Hopefully we’ve given you some good color about how we’re thinking about the business going forward. Again, have a great day everyone. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-08-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results. I'm pleased that the Western Digital team executed well and delivered solid results in light of the ongoing macro and geopolitical dynamics. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 32% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78, all within the guidance ranges we provided in April. Fiscal year 2022 revenue totaled $18.8 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.22. This compares to revenue of $16.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 in fiscal year 2021. We grew revenue 11% and EPS increased 81%, demonstrating progress in unlocking the earnings potential of our business. In addition to strong financial performance, fiscal year 2022 was a hallmark year for Western Digital from an innovation, product development and execution perspective. In particular, we regained innovation leadership with the introduction of multiple products and technologies for the cloud. In May, we announced a 26-terabyte drive, leveraging our OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies as well as ePMR. Impressively, this means we've nearly doubled drive capacity relative to when I joined Western Digital just over two years ago. In Flash, we expanded adoption of our NVMe enterprise SSD from one cloud titan to three as well as qualification at several enterprise OEM suppliers. From an organization perspective, we have bolstered the company's executive management team, further strengthening our ability to drive operational excellence, innovation and disciplined financial management. On top of all of these achievements, we reduced debt by $1.7 billion and attained an investment-grade corporate rating, placing Western Digital on a solid financial foundation. Before I jump into additional detail on the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our strategic review. As you know, two months ago, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing long-term value for our shareholders. The Executive Committee of the Board, which I lead, continues to oversee the review and Elliott Management is participating alongside us under a non-disclosure agreement, along with other interested parties. We're evaluating a range of alternatives, including options for separating our market-leading Flash and HDD franchises. We are moving expeditiously, but this work will take time. We will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today giving -- given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process. We will provide updates in the future as appropriate. Now I'll provide updates on our HDD and Flash businesses. During the fiscal fourth quarter, strong demand from our cloud customers for our latest generation energy-assisted drives drove near-record near-line shipments of 111 exabytes. Total HDD revenue declined sequentially due primarily to consumer and client HDD demand. We commenced commercial shipment of a number of products incorporating our OptiNAND technology. In addition to shipments of our 20- terabyte and 22-terabyte CMR drives, qualifications of our 26-terabyte SMR drive are underway, as we noted at our product launch event in May. This SMR-enabled drive enables 20% higher capacity than our CMR variants, offering significantly better TCO for our cloud customers and further highlighting the performance-driven benefits of the innovation that Western Digital is packing into a hard drive. Finally, we are ramping a second cloud customer with SMR technology this quarter and remain on track to lead the industry's transition to SMR-based drives for the cloud. We are very confident in our multiyear product roadmap for capacity enterprise drives, which combine ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR and triple-stage actuators to deliver a cutting-edge portfolio of drives in commercial volumes at a wide variety of capacity points. We also continue to invest in HAMR and the commercialization of this technology alongside our other HDD technologies that are leading the industry. The breadth and depth of this portfolio strongly positions us to be the provider of choice for the largest and most complex data centers in the world. Building on the expertise cultivated over decades of bringing to market industry-leading technologies, we are committed to leveraging our innovations to continue driving business results in capacity enterprise into the future. Turning to Flash. Revenue grew sequentially on an improving product mix and increased flash supply. Growth in Flash during the quarter came primarily from enterprise SSD, with revenue more than doubling sequentially. Gaming is another key growth market for us, where we continue to demonstrate the strength of our client SSD franchise with exabyte shipment growing nearly 70% year-over-year. We have a leading position in gaming with our WD_BLACK brand being recognized globally for innovation, performance and quality. The latest example of this is our WD_BLACK SN-850 NVMe SSD product certified for Sony PS5 game consoles, which enables players to expand the high-speed storage capacity of their PS5 console and allows them to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games directly from the drive. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented about half of our Flash revenue in the June quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter. We are preparing to ramp BiCS6 late this calendar year and into 2023. Based on circuit under array architecture, BiCS6 enables many exciting high-performance products for 5G phones, SSDs and QLC flash. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In the cloud end market, we experienced strength in the fiscal fourth quarter as supply constraints at Western Digital and our end customers started to ease. Overall, demand from our cloud customers has been consistently strong and we expect this strength in cloud to carry into the second half of calendar year 2022. We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive cloud growth and believe we are on track to generate about half of our revenue from this market by fiscal year 2025. Outside of cloud, our expectations for calendar year 2022 demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. As the fiscal fourth quarter progressed, we saw consumer spending soften, impacting both retail Flash and HDD demand. This weakness has migrated to the consumer PC end market as we enter the second half of the calendar year. In client, the market generally expect PC shipments to decline approximately 10% in calendar year 2022. We are seeing our PC OEM customers aggressively rightsize their inventory to reflect current demand conditions, which will impact our business in this market in the second half of the calendar year. After going through that correction, we expect a more normal flow of business going forward as we believe PCs will continue to fulfill broader use cases as the foundation of the increasingly common hybrid enterprise, driving unit demand above pre-pandemic levels in richer SSD content. All of these PC market dynamics are accelerating the final phase of the shift of client devices from HDD to flash technology. Consequently, the client HDD market is now declining at an accelerated rate relative to the period before the onset of the pandemic. To reflect this reality, we are now taking aggressive action to restructure our HDD manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic. In mobile, expectations for smartphone units have come down in recent months, led primarily by reduced demand in China. Industry analysts expect the smartphone industry unit volume to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year in calendar 2022. While we are well-positioned in supplying flash memory for 5G smartphones, we are also seeing our largest customers aggressively resetting their inventories for these products. We expect the inventory correction to be primarily impact our fiscal first quarter and return to market demand for the remainder of the fiscal year. In consumer, we have a premium brand and a great franchise in the marketplace. In particular, we have developed an enviable position and excellent relationships with major brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers across the globe, including Best Buy and Target in the US, MSH Group in Europe, JD.com in China and Officeworks in Australia. As a result of these strong relationships, our impressive scale, product breadth and trusted brand, we lead most consumer storage product categories. While macroeconomic factors and COVID measures have impacted consumer demand in the near term, our customers' loyalty and preference for the performance and quality of our solutions are key differentiators, which will position Western Digital well, for the upcoming back-to-school and holiday seasons. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I want to leave you with a few takeaways. First, at the Investor Day, we laid out the case, where the world of ever-increasing intelligent devices powered by the cloud is creating an astonishing amount of data, of which only a small percentage is stored. Our conviction remains strong and our view on near double-digit revenue growth remains intact. Over the past several years, the storage market has entered an era of accelerated growth, led by the strength of the cloud market, which drove HDD revenue growth for Western Digital and the industry. In Flash, capital investments for incremental NAND bit growth are becoming more expensive, resulting in a more disciplined investment across the industry. At Western Digital, our long-standing and growing relationships with hyperscale and OEM customers across the world, coupled with our leadership in commercializing innovations for capacity enterprise hard drives and momentum with NVMe enterprise SSD for data center, has made us a trusted partner. This combination of rapid demand growth in storage, technology leadership and product momentum offer Western Digital opportunities for financial outperformance. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results and provide an outlook for the fiscal first quarter.
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, reflecting the resilience and agility of our business model, against such a dynamic macro environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78, within the guidance range we provided in April. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue was $18.8 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 4.3 percentage points and non-GAAP operating margin increased 5.7 percentage points, as we proactively managed our expenses, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $8.22, up 81% from last year. Turning to our end markets. For the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 46% of total revenue at $2.1 billion, up 18% sequentially and 5% from a year ago. Within Cloud, Western Digital's continued success in leading the industry transition to energy-assisted hard drives drove the growth. The continued ramp of our 18-terabyte and 20-terabyte drives drove a 7% year-over-year increase in nearline HDD revenue. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments increased 9% to 111 exabytes. In Flash, enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled sequentially and was up 38% year-over-year. The client end market represented 36% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, down 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, client HDD led the revenue decline, while Flash revenue was roughly flat. Consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, down 9% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue decline due to lower HDD retail shipments. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline in retail products across HDD and Flash. For the full fiscal year 2022, Cloud revenue increased 40% year-over-year, led by a 38% increase in nearline HDD. Flash product revenue for enterprise SSD applications more than doubled year-over-year. Client revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as growth in Flash was offset by a 30% decrease in client HDD. Client HDD for PCs and Notebooks represents just mid-single-digit percentage of total HDD revenue exiting the fiscal year. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 6% for the year, all attributed to a decline in retail HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported Flash revenue of $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were up 2% on a blended basis and up slightly on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. HDD revenue of $2.1 billion was flat sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per HDD increased by 19% to $120 as our mix continues to transition towards the cloud. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 10% and average price per unit increased by 24%. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. We continue to exert disciplined financial management to drive better results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.3%, up 60 basis points sequentially and down 60 basis points year-over-year. Our Flash gross margin was 35.9%, up 30 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, growth in enterprise SSD for data center applications led the improvement in gross margin. Our HDD gross margin was 28.2%, up 50 basis points sequentially and down 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $760 million were below our guidance range as we continue to prudently manage our expenses. Operating income was $702 million, representing an 8% increase from the prior quarter and a 15% decrease year-over-year. Our tax rate was 11% for both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. Earnings per share was $1.78, compared to $1.65 in the prior quarter, and $2.16 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $295 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $97 million. Operating cash flow was impacted by revenue linearity. The ramp back to normal production output at the flash joint venture, timing of component deliveries to our factories and corporate-related control measures in China contributed to a back-end loaded quarter. Cash, capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment; and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $392 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity. Gross CapEx and cash CapEx for the fiscal year 2022 were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, below our expectation, as we actively managed our capital investments. We made a $150 million scheduled and discretionary debt repayment. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5 times compared to 2.4 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This amount is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. I'll now provide our view of both HDD and Flash businesses for the fiscal first quarter as well as comments on several key items for fiscal year 2023. For the fiscal first quarter, we expect Flash to lead the sequential revenue decline as our customer's right-size their inventory. We expect a relatively modest decline in overall HDD revenue, primarily driven by client and consumer, with gross margin relatively flat. As we look towards fiscal year 2023, we expect cash capital expenditures to be in line with our target model, within the range of 8% to 10% of total revenue. Total gross capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3.2 billion. Regarding Flash CapEx, we remain excited about our technology road map despite what is clearly a volatile period in the memory industry. As we have discussed on prior calls, BiCS6 is more capital intensive technology node that will require an increase in capital expenditures. Our CapEx outlook for fiscal year 2023 reflects our commitment to technology leadership and will accelerate our path to leapfrog from BiCS6 to BiCS+ in the next several years. I am also pleased to share that the Flash JV Fab 7 manufacturing facility at Yokkaichi plant has been approved to receive a subsidy of up to JPY92.9 billion from the Japanese government, further demonstrating the strategic importance of what is the world's largest NAND manufacturing facility. Given the macro environment, we continue to actively manage our capital expenditures and supply. We are in discussion with our joint venture partner to adjust capital investments and align our production growth with demand. In HDD, we will continue to focus our capital spending primarily in heads and media in order to meet the future growth in cloud demand. Offsetting these investments, we are taking aggressive actions to restructure our client HDD manufacturing footprint. We strive to optimize free cash flow generation in response to the macroeconomic dynamics. For our fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 27.5% and 29.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 30% in the first quarter and for fiscal year 2023. This increase is due to the tax law changes that became effective for our fiscal year 2023, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D expenses that were previously eligible for immediate deduction from taxable income. These changes are expected to result in an immediate increase in our tax rate of approximately 12 percentage points, which will then decrease gradually over time. We expect earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.65 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. In summary, we continue to believe that we have built the right foundation for long-term growth. We have reignited our innovation, established discipline in spending and investment and remain consistent in deleveraging our balance sheet. The innovation engine that drives TCO benefits and value to our customers, the multiple channels to deliver our products to market and the large and growing storage markets put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the proliferation of intelligent devices and rapidly accelerating data creation. While segments of our end markets are now going through an aggressive inventory adjustment as supply chain impacts of the pandemic start to ease and the macro economy softens, secular demand for storage continues to be strong and underpins the digital transformation that continues across all industries. I also want to thank our employees for their hard work during the fiscal year. Despite ongoing geopolitical and macro challenges, our team worked together to deliver strong financial performance for Western Digital. I am proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in the next fiscal year. All right. Peter, with that, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call.  And today's first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first off, just want to clarify here. In terms of what's driving the weakness, is it safe to say that it's entirely consumer client and that on the hyperscale and enterprise side you're not seeing any changes? And as part of that, as you think about this inventory correction on the consumer client side, how long do you think the duration will last? Is this a one-quarter phenomenon? Too early to tell? Would love to hear your thoughts there.
David Goeckeler: Hi C.J., good morning. Yes, I would say, youâve pretty much got it right. The one thing I would add to that on the Cloud side is, we are seeing some inventory digestion in China cloud. The US hyperscalers continue to chug along. But especially in the PC OEMs is where we saw it first, a very sharp inventory correction really in the current quarter, taking down their demand significantly to reset their inventory for what is the reality for the number of unit sales. So right now, we think that is a relatively short period of time. Is it one quarter, two quarter, we'll see that as we go through the quarter, but it's definitely very, very sharp in the quarter we're in. And then in the smartphone market, we're seeing it as well. As a matter of fact, it's even developing within the quarter. Just a couple of weeks ago, we had one of our biggest customers take down their forecast in the quarter by over $150 million. So -- and it's all like the message, very strong message we're getting directly from our customers, this is just resetting inventory. So that one, we expect to be a one-quarter phenomena. I think in a larger market, we'll see over the next couple of quarters. I will say that in the consumer and channel space, given our broad reach and where we operate around the world in the consumer business, we are starting to see some stabilization of those markets. Our channel business, if you look at sell-through for the first 4 weeks of the quarter, has been on plan. And even some regions like Europe, we're starting to see some strength. And I would say consumer is pretty much in the same place, starting to stabilize, not great growth yet, but that part of the market looks better than it did, let's say, two months ago. And it's really the OEMs that are really in a rapid and significant correction of inventory as well as, as I said, some of the cloud business in China.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And just a follow-up question on the NAND side of the house. You talked about rising cap intensity at BiCS6 and what's next. But at the same time, it sounds like you're talking about tempering investments at the JV. So could you walk through how you're thinking about forward CapEx given the changes you're seeing in the end markets?
David Goeckeler: Yeah, I'll make a few comments and Wissam can comment as well. But we've always known that BiCS6 was going to be a more capital intensive node. I mean, again, we're coming off of a BiCS5, which is the most capital efficient node in the history of the -- our road map, so that's not surprising. And we're driving through that transition. We feel very good about the node. It's just it's a more capital intensive note. Now I will note, as we talked extensively about our Investor Day, our capital intensity in general per bit is the best in the industry, and that's something we really strive for in our road map. So when we're talking about a more capital intensive node, remember, that's a relative issue. We're still in the best position as far as capital per additional bit, and that's a very, very big focus of ours. Now the more macro question is, we're obviously having conversations across the JV about resetting our bit growth in general, independent of node, given the reality of what the demand environment is. Overall, bit demand is coming down. We're in an oversupply environment, itâs demand driven oversupply, it's not a supply driven oversupply. But we'll reset. We're looking at our CapEx. And we'll make adjustments given what the current situation is. Wissam?
Wissam Jabre: Yeah. If I can add, C.J. The -- we're targeting our cash CapEx per our target model, which is 8% to 10% of revenue. But, of course, as the macro conditions develop, if we need to adjust to that, we will manage dynamically.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks guys. Good morning. So I've got a couple of questions, if I can as well. I just -- I wanted to unpack a little bit more the implied Flash revenue expectation you're making this quarter. With hard disk drive revenue being flat roughly sequentially, it looks like you're talking about a high 20% or 30% sequential decline in the NAND revenue this quarter, the Flash revenue. With that in mind, I mean, how are you guys thinking about bit shift versus what is your assumption around pricing baked into that expectation? I'm just trying to understand, is this more pricing versus bit shipped? And is this really kind of -- do you think that this guide represents a bottom here?
David Goeckeler: Yeah. I think the way to think about it, as I said earlier, it's kind of a demand driven situation where we're just seeing are biggest customer, and really not all of our customers across the PC space, just resetting inventory and really dropping their demand in the quarter, so they can reset their inventory. So that leads to pricing pressure and volume pressure, so it's both of them. And so as we work through the quarter and they get their inventory to where they need it to, then I think we'll see some of the volume come back as we work through this. From some of our customers, I have more confidence that this is a one-quarter change. But other ones, I think it may take a little longer than that. So we'll see -- we'll have more information as we work through the quarter and we'll be talking about that through the quarter in the appropriate forums. As I said before, I will point out, I mean, this is a very dynamic market. I mean this is -- some of this has happened in the quarter. So it's very difficult to bound this, but we think we're very -- we're confident in the guide, don't get me wrong. But I'm happy we guided when we did because the -- it's a very, very dynamic environment out there. But I think our customers are aggressively managing their inventory. And my sense is they'll get through it in a pretty expeditious fashion. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we've got kind of the supply chain is loosening up. We're getting more components. I think our customers are getting more components. Maybe that's giving them more confidence in how they manage their own inventory. And at the same time, we're going into a softer economy. So everybody is in a big reset and it's especially impacting the Flash business, to your point. The HDD business still get consistent strong growth out of the hyperscalers in the US, and feel very, very good about the portfolio position there and what we're going to drive throughout the fiscal year.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And as a quick follow-up, just thinking about the Flash business a little bit more. These last couple of quarters, and appreciating that mix is a factor, but these last couple of quarters, it looks like you've seen a little bit of a slowing of your ability to drive cost down in the Flash business. As we think about BiCS6, how are you thinking about the relative cost down structure of BiCS6 relative to BiCS5? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yeah. I mean the -- as we've talked about cost downs, we target 15%. We always know there's going to be some quarters below, some above. Hopefully, there's more on the favorable side, and I think that's been the history, but we've hit a couple of quarters where that's not the case. But if you look at our fiscal year, we delivered right at the 15%, I think, even a tick over. Is that right, Wissam?
Wissam Jabre: Yes, that's correct, David. And one of the things to keep in mind, Aaron, is we did have the fab contamination in the third fiscal quarter. And so this is why -- this is partly why we haven't seen necessarily the same cadence of cost reduction in the last couple of quarters of the fiscal 2022.
David Goeckeler: So Aaron, we feel really good about the BiCS6 transition and what that's going to bring. And I think you'll see in the upcoming quarters, the costs will get back to where we expect it to be. We explicitly drive our road map around this number. We explicitly drive the nodal transition and the road map development around making sure we can deliver the 15% year-over-year and we are very pleased that we just delivered it again in the last fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could address, I mean, I didn't hear a specific answer to volume versus prices in NAND in Q3, but I guess what is your inventory balance going to look like at the end of Q3? And I know in the past, you guys have been willing to take fab utilization adjustments to keep that number under control. Have you thought about that in this environment?
David Goeckeler: Yeah. I'll make a few comments. I'll let Wissam make a few comments. And we don't guide to that level of specificity, but they're both roughly down about the same.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. That's where the numbers shape up, roughly among the same.
Joe Moore: And your inventory balance?
Wissam Jabre: Well, given that this is mostly demand driven, we expect inventory to be -- to grow a bit this quarter as the supply is higher than the -- where the demand is. However, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are in discussions with our JV partners to take appropriate action if -- to the extent we can to limit that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please, go ahead.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow-up on the HDD side, taking it on the positive end, Dave, maybe if you could give a little color on your confidence level on the sustainability of the US hyperscalers' spending trends. What gives you the confidence that this will at least carry through the second half of this year and maybe into the early parts of 2023?
David Goeckeler: Yes, a couple of things. One is the message we get from them -- obviously, we have a very, very close relationship and talk on a daily basis. And so the message we get in planning for the second half continues to be a strong and consistent message. We've got a great portfolio around 22 and 26 and SMR. I think one of the big highlights of last quarter on the HDD side is we got a second hyperscaler that fully qualified SMR. And with our position with UltraSMR getting 20% more out of a drive puts us in a great position for that transition. So it continues to be a very, very consistent message from them about how they plan to consume the product in the second half and going into next year. And like I said, from the portfolio point of view, we've got lots of new qualifications underway on 22 terabytes CMR, 26 terabyte SMR. And as we go through the fiscal year, you'll see all of those products start to ramp and be adopted at volume.
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question, in terms of following up from your Analyst Day where you did put a big focus on the NAND flash moving to the SSD market for the Cloud segment itself as well. Do you see this shift beginning with BiCS6, or is this more of a BiCS+ type of endeavor where it will be future generations where you see the biggest shift towards SSD NAND?
David Goeckeler: No. I mean, the shift is happening now. I mean, we just delivered a quarter of 105% sequential growth on our enterprise SSD portfolio. Now that's a particularly strong result. But we're very confident that as we work through the next couple of years, we're going to drive our share of enterprise SSD from the 8% to 16%. We've got a very good plan for that. It's a great market to participate in. Like I said, we broke through with the qualifications and the success has been strong. Now it will be lumpy, not every quarter is going to be up. But the trajectory over the three-year time span is we have a lot of confidence, we're going to drive that to the 16% share in FY 2025.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, before we go to our next question, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question in the interest of time. Today's next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. You're basically shipping well below demand levels, given the inventory correction when you look at the September quarter. Can you maybe help quantify that and help us think through if the digestion that you're calling for is completed, let's say, in September, what's roughly the right base we should be thinking of to drive any sequential growth off of that in -- for the December quarter?
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean, for -- in the PC market, we think the market is -- there was consensus earlier in the year of maybe 325 million units. We think that's going to land more around 305 million units. So, that gives you a sense of the correction that's happening aggressively right now. And we saw -- I think we talked about smartphone demand being down single-digits, mid-single-digits on a unit percentage. So I think, Wamsi, we're just going through this very sharp step-down right now where everybody resets their inventory, especially as they have -- I personally think, as they have more confidence, that the inventory -- the supply chain is loosening up. It's not completely loosened up, there's still tight areas. But in general, we're able to get more upsides on products that -- components that even a couple of quarters ago were very tight. So, I think everybody is kind of resetting for that world and they're resetting going into a softer consumer environment. So, I think that gives you a little bit to bracket how we're thinking about it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. So, looking at your Flash margins, they are still at a pretty decent level in the June quarter, but obviously that will come down in the September quarter. But with margins coming down into, let's say, the next few quarters given where the pricing is heading, do you think your margins will get back to that last trough in 2019 when it was below 20%? Obviously, pricing is out of your control, but are there things in your control that you will make the mix trough be better than the last one? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean I think that we've done a tremendous amount of work on the portfolio in the last couple of years, and I think that's is going to show up. And the way we think about through-cycle margin, we talked a lot about this at the -- our Investor Day, we're managing for through-cycle margin. We want to drive the higher lows and higher highs. And we think we're set up well to do that given the qualifications across enterprise SSD. Our very strong position in gaming, that's been a great market for us and a growth area just over the last year and a half. So, yes, I think it's -- I think we go into this situation with a lot better portfolio and a lot better diversity, a lot more places to put our supply, and we think that's going to lead to a better result.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a multipart question on your HDD business, primarily around utilization rates and CapEx and the restructuring plan that you talked about. In terms of utilization rates, your nearest competitor talked about making some adjustments in the near term. Is that something that you guys are thinking about or doing in HDD? And on the CapEx side, what's contemplated in your fiscal 2023 outlook, again, as it pertains to your hard drive business? And then on the restructuring, I was hoping you could expand on what exactly you're doing, how much capacity is coming online over the next -- in the medium to long-term? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Toshiya. So, let me just add a little context and, Wissam, give a little more detail on CapEx and how we're thinking about this. So, as we talked about that the client HDD market has been interesting over the last couple of years. We went into the pandemic and we saw a big surge in demand for client hard drives. Just in general, we saw a big surge in demand for PCs. That has turned around dramatically. And what we're seeing right now is that business is down over 50% year-over-year. So we're seeing â it's returning to pre-pandemic trajectory, and even going down faster than that now as far as the transition to flash happens. That's a good transition for us, because we have such a great portfolio in client SSD. So we've been playing that transition for years. But it really calls for us to reset our â how much client HDD capacity we have in the system, and that's what we're aggressively undertaking right now.
Wissam Jabre: Yes. So on that, Toshiya, on the restructuring, we're basically, as David said, we're taking â we're reducing our manufacturing footprint on the client side. And the expectation is this should benefit us from a couple of areas, a little bit on the CapEx side, but also in terms of the cost of goods sold. And so if there's any underutilization that was associated with that or would have been associated with that part of the manufacturing capacity, it's being basically managed out. And so that should help us be able to â as we sort of said, in terms of the gross margin transition for the HDD business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we're expecting it to be more or less flat. And so based on that, we should probably see even further improvements in the following quarters.
David Goeckeler : On CapEx.
Wissam Jabre: And on CapEx, we typically don't break out the CapEx between HDD and Flash. But as I said, we do plan to stay within our target model of the 8% to 10% of revenue. And if you recall at Investor Day, I did say that the â we typically â we would like to get to a point where for the HDD business we target 4% to 6%, maybe higher than this, in the near term simply because we are investing in the capacity enterprise side of the â of the manufacturing of the house. The one thing though to keep in mind is, we are keeping a close eye to the supply-demand situation, and we do not plan to be investing or building overcapacity short term to be able to maintain that supply-demand balance.
David Goeckeler: So Toshiya, just a few more comments on this so we fully paint the picture. So you're really starting to see this, what we talked about at our Analyst Day. In heads and media, we still have to invest. I mean there's â we need â these big drives have a lot of heads in them, so we're still investing in heads. Media, we transition to capacity enterprise. But we just have the manufacturing ability to produce millions and millions of client drives that we don't need anymore. So that's the part we're resetting, and to get that cost out of the system.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O'Malley: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to look at the overall business. Obviously, you've talked about the moving parts into September. But could you talk about when you think you might see the total top line start to recover? I know, there's a lot of moving parts. I know, there's not a ton of visibility right now. But obviously, from a net income pro forma earnings perspective, do you guys see yourselves making losses in the coming quarters? And just if you do, can you talk about the depth in which you're kind of planning for that based on recessionary scenario? Just any color on where you might see this bottom from a total company perspective? Thank you. 
David Goeckeler: So first off, we don't see losses, no. So, look, you hit on it. It's just very dynamic right now. Let me paint the picture and Wissam can say, maybe a little bit about the out quarters. We're seeing â I would say, if we went back several quarters, we started talking about it very early this year. The consumer started softening really in Europe when the war broke out, in China with the lockdowns and that progressed throughout the first half of the year. The consumer business is something that usually is soft. It's seasonally the weakest part of the year. April and May, calendar Q2 is an interesting quarter for that business because it always starts off in April and May and comes on strong in June, that really didn't happen. It stayed soft. And then we started to see the spread into consumer -- consumers purchasing PCs and now smartphones. And so, now we're seeing the OEMs and the PC and the smartphone business, as we talked about, very aggressively reset their inventory levels. At the same time, we're starting to see the consumer in our channel business, stabilize. So, we're starting to see the early signs of the consumer business stabilizing, the channel business, stabilizing. If I look at sell-through for the first part of the quarter, it was to plan. Sell-in, it's still a little bit behind because nobody wants to build inventory right now. But sell-through has stabilized. And in some regions, like I said, in Europe, we're even seeing Q-over-Q growth in the channel. So it all depends on how we get -- how fast we get through the inventory correction on the OEM side. And then just to cap that off, in the cloud, we continue to see very consistent demand from the US hyperscalers and we see some digestion in China cloud. And we expect that digestion in China cloud to work its way through this quarter. In general, China has been, I think the word I would say, has been quiet across all the markets. There's not a lot of visibility. We'll see how that comes back throughout the quarter. But that gives you a little bit of kind of the evolution of how we've seen this and kind of how we see it going forward, as I said. Although the PC and the OEMs are going through â PC and smartphone OEMs are going through very, very sharp correction, we are seeing other parts of the market start to stabilize. So, I don't know, Wissam, you want to add that up? We don't really forecast the out quarters, but anything to say about that?
Wissam Jabre: Yes. I mean we don't forecast the out quarters. We don't see losses. The one â the couple of points I would add to that, David, is we obviously are â with this down cycle, we're starting from a much, much stronger financial position. We've done a lot over the last couple of years to strengthen our financial position. We also launched a very exciting set of products last quarter. So, we have really a very strong portfolio. We have good additions to the leadership team. And so, we're in a much better position to manage through this.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I also had a two-part question is on HDD gross margin. And you're still running a couple of hundred basis points lower than your peer. And I'm wondering if you can sort of unpack that. Is this related to the client capacity that you're trying to take out? And then on the NAND side, you answered a prior question saying that -- I think you're implying that the decline is roughly equal between bits and pricing. And I just want to clarify, is that what you meant to say? Because if that's the case, then bits are certainly -- well, I mean, both bits and pricing are down more than your peers. So I'm just wondering if you can sort of handicap why your NAND business is performing worse than your peers. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: So on HDD, I think -- I think the gap in gross margin is now 100 basis points. But first of all, I feel good about the quarter we had on gross margin. We expected -- we expected -- well, let's put it this way. We're able to get the gross margins up in HDD a little faster than we thought. When we talked about last quarter, we thought they would start going up sequentially going into the second half, and we were able to pull some of that back into calendar Q2, our fiscal Q4. That was due to a number of things. One is pricing continues to be pretty benign to even up a little bit, which is something we've been -- I think the industry has been striving for, again, given all the innovation we're bringing to market. And then we were able to work some on the cost side as well. Us versus our competitors, remember, everybody has a different mix. And they -- there are some markets, especially the performance enterprise markets that Western Digital exited a number of years ago, and that's a declining but margin-rich part of the HDD market that we don't participate in. But in general, from a margin perspective, on HDD, I get back to innovation, the portfolio, the 22-terabyte drive, the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drives, those are in a unique position in the industry. And we have a plan as we move through FY 2023. Those will become bigger and bigger and, in fact, the predominant part of the portfolio and what we're shipping as we move through the year. So I think that sets us up in a very strong position to have a really good TCO conversation with our customers as we continue to drive innovation. Second part of your question was in Flash. Again, this is a very dynamic market. Things have changed even in the last week and half to two weeks. So I think that we're at a different point of when we're forecasting and we are rolling in everything we have heard from our customers. As I said, we have customers that have very, very significant amounts of demand that are changing within the quarter. So we put a guide around that. Obviously, we'll work to make that better, but that's the reality of where the business is today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. David, I just wanted to follow up to the last comment. You highlighted earlier in the call that you remain comfortable with near-line cloud demand, especially in North America. And then you just said that demand is very volatile. What gives you confidence that the North American cloud service providers go through inventory digestion later this year and into next year? Is there anything that you can share with us? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: I think it's just our deep relationship with them and the conversation we have. We also have multi-quarter agreements with a lot of these customers, which gives us more visibility into what their plans are. We're, obviously, in deep conversations with them about our next generation products, which is very exciting. We're able to bring a market-leading capacity points to them across CMR and SMR. So, again, 22-terabyte CMR is a unique product in the industry. And then we have 26-terabyte SMR, which is, again, a unique product in the industry. Nobody else can go to those capacity points. And so, we feel very good about where the portfolio is. Those are being adopted and qualified across our customer base. I think the strength of where we're at in the TCO equation we bring to our customers, as well as the visibility that we see and given the relationship gives us confidence as we move through the second half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you spending time with us here early on a Friday morning. Thanks for all the great questions, and we'll look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-04-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. We delivered excellent performance in the quarter, with revenue of $4.4 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.7%, both of which are at the higher end of our updated guidance ranges we provided in early March. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which exceeded our revised guidance. I am proud of the team's execution as we navigated dynamic geopolitical and macroeconomic environment as well as ongoing supply challenges. On top of that, we successfully managed through a fab contamination event that is now fully resolved. Overall, the Western Digital team did an amazing job of meeting our customers' growing and evolving storage needs. This has all been made possible by the operational and technological improvements we have made over the last couple of years that enable us to unlock the true earnings power of the Western Digital model. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the business outlook for calendar year 2022. We believe the secular demand for storage in our new product ramps in HDD and Flash, combined with the seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year, will drive growth across our end markets. With 40% of the world's data stored on Western Digital products, our innovation powers the global technology ecosystem from consumer devices to the edge to the heart of the cloud. Our vision is to create breakthrough innovation inspired by the convergence of human potential and digital transformation that enables the world to actualize its aspirations. At Western Digital, we have established an admirable position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to develop a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a unique position to capitalize on the promising growth opportunities ahead of us. I'll now turn to an update on our HDD and Flash businesses. Our HDD revenue was as forecast and in line with typical March quarter seasonality led by growth in capacity enterprise drives. Robust demand in the cloud end market for 18- and 20-terabyte drives generated a nearly 40% increase in nearline revenue from the same period last year. Of note, our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments approached high single-digit percentage of total capacity enterprise shipments. During the quarter, qualification of OptiNAND-based hard drives progressed as planned across multiple cloud and OEM customers. Combining OptiNAND with our SMR leadership uniquely positions Western Digital in the marketplace. Putting it all together, we have positioned our innovations in OptiNAND and SMR to drive business results in our capacity enterprise business for the rest of this calendar year and into the future. Our largest cloud customers are aligned with this strategy and are accelerating adoption of SMR products within data centers later this year. We are laser-focused on bringing new cutting-edge features and functions to our products for cloud storage. We will provide more details around these exciting innovations at our Investor Day on May 10. Turning to Flash. Our overall business was impacted by our ability to ship product due to the fab excursion. In light of this event, coupled with the supply chain challenges facing all companies across the industry, I would like to thank our customers and the Western Digital teams for working together diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. From a product perspective, client SSD demand improved in the quarter as our PC OEM customers successfully worked through their own supply chain issues. Gaming is another growth market for us, where we continue to have success with exabyte shipment nearly doubling year-over-year. We have a leading position in the marketplace with our brands, including WD_BLACK, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional, recognized globally for cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. An example of this is our WD_BLACK SN770 SSD product, which leverages our cutting-edge BiCS5 technology, an in-house DRAM-less controller architecture. This SSD product is one of the fastest and best drives available in the market. We have received excellent reviews from tech journalists, which is a great testament to the company's strength in both our BiCS technology leadership and our ability to develop innovative solutions, enabling our customers to unlock the potential of their PCs. Qualifications of BiCS5-based products for client and consumer end markets were largely completed, and we are making great progress in qualifying our next-generation BiCS5 enterprise SSD products. We expect these products to drive revenue growth and mix improvements into the future. Lastly, BiCS5 represented nearly half of the Flash revenue, up from 41% in the previous quarter. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In cloud, we see continued strength in calendar year 2022. The increase in cloud capital investment for data center build-outs is expected to propel growth for our HDD and Flash products in this growing end market. In client, PC end demand growth has been solid for the last 2 years, and we are starting to see some normalization in the PC market. We expect PC unit demand to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, with the return-to-site trend driving a mix shift towards commercial and enterprise PCs with richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, we have a strong position in 5G phones and we see demand for the latest 5G flagship phones remaining solid, with NAND content doubling from prior generation smartphones. In other emerging applications, demand from gaming and VR/AR devices remains robust. Industry analysts expect VR headset sales to grow at a 47% CAGR over the next couple of years. In consumer, we are experiencing short-term demand weakness outside the U.S. tied to the geopolitical events in Europe, as well as COVID-related lockdowns in China. However, we are confident in the strength of the business as we are entering a seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year with a number of new innovative products. We feel good about the overall demand in calendar year 2022. We are continuing to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors I mentioned earlier. While these transitory issues are affecting both revenue and gross margin in the near term, we expect them to subside over time. We are confident that the growth and profitability opportunities in front of us have not changed. In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and unrelenting spirit of our employees that goes into creating our game-changing products. In particular, I want to thank our employees in China for their efforts to work through all the supply chain and logistics challenges during the lockdowns. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I wanted to make a quick announcement that Western Digital and the IRS have reached a tentative agreement to resolve a long-running tax matter, covering the fiscal years 2008 through 2015. With offsetting tax benefits, we expect the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million. While this settlement will result in a previously unforecasted cash payment in fiscal year 2023, it does highlight the work that I and the rest of the Western Digital team have undertaken in the last 2 years to instill strong financial discipline and provide greater financial flexibility upon which we are building a foundation for future growth for the company. Wissam will go into more detail in a minute. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal third quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Wissam?
Wissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal third quarter were better than our revised expectations. Despite the incredibly dynamic macro environment that David discussed, our results reflected the resilience of our business and our ability to continually deliver solid financial performance. In addition, we completed a debt restructuring with our lenders in the March quarter, marking continued success in paying down debt and providing increased financial flexibility and stability. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, down 9% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.65, above the revised guidance range of $1.30 to $1.60 we provided in early March. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of the challenging environment. Turning to our end markets. Cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.8 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 25% from a year ago. Within cloud, Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point and ramp of 20-terabyte drives drove a nearly 40% year-over-year increase in nearline revenue. This growth was partially offset by lower enterprise SSD and smart video hard drive revenues. The client end market represented 40% of total revenue at $1.7 billion, down 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to typical seasonality in both Flash for mobile and client hard drives. On a year-over-year basis, growth in Flash was offset by a decline in hard drive. Lastly, Consumer represented 20% of revenue at $0.9 billion, down 17% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline was primarily due to lower retail Flash shipments. The year-over-year decrease was roughly evenly split between hard drive and Flash products. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported Flash revenue of $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. On a blended basis, Flash ASPs were down 1% sequentially. On a like-for-like basis, Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and increased 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recognized the majority of the bit supply impact caused by the fab contamination. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $101. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments and average price per hard drive increased by 20% and 22%, respectively. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. In the March quarter, total fab contamination charges of $203 million were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Gross margin for the third quarter was 31.7%, down 190 basis points sequentially and up 400 basis points year-over-year, including approximately $59 million in COVID-related expenses. Our Flash gross margin was 35.6%, down 50 basis points sequentially and up 560 basis points year-over-year. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.7%, down 290 basis points sequentially and up 270 basis points year-over-year. Hard drive gross margin included COVID-related impact of approximately $51 million or 240 basis points. Operating expenses of $740 million were below our guidance range as we tightly managed our expenses. Operating income was $650 million, representing a 26% decrease from the prior quarter and a 58% increase year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.65, up from $1.02 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $398 million, and free cash flow was $148 million. Cash and capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, represented a cash outflow of $250 million. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity and expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $2.9 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be around $1.3 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. In the fiscal third quarter, we made a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.25 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.51 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.4x compared to 2.6x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before discussing our outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on the settlement with the IRS that David mentioned. As previously disclosed in our quarterly SEC filings, the company has been in a significant long-running situation with the IRS regarding taxes owed for fiscal years 2008 through 2015. As you can see in our GAAP statements, we took a tax charge in the fiscal third quarter, primarily based on our latest assessment of the situation. In the last few days, we reached a tentative agreement to settle the transfer pricing issues in dispute. The actual amount to Western Digital will have to pay and exact timing of the payments have not been determined yet. However, we currently expect to make a cash payment in the range of $600 million to $700 million some time in the first half of fiscal 2023. Please note that this is the cash out number. We currently expect that the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million after accounting for certain offsetting tax benefits expected to be recouped over the next 3 years. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will make a GAAP-only adjustment to the reserve associated with this settlement. You will find additional details in our 10-Q, which we plan to file next week. I'll now provide our view of both hard drive and flash businesses for the fiscal fourth quarter. As we indicated on our last earnings call, we continue to expect hard drive revenue to increase driven by growth in nearline hard drives. We also expect Flash revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth fiscal quarter as our flash supply improves.  For our fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion with sequential revenue growth for both hard drive and flash businesses; we expect gross margin to be between 31% and 33%; we expect operating expenses to be between $770 million and $790 million; interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million; our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the fourth quarter; we expect earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.90 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook for the calendar year as customer demand across our end markets continues to be generally strong. Despite the supply chain challenges and macroeconomic factors we discussed earlier, it is evident that we have the right foundation for long-term growth, the right technology portfolio in place to meet evolving customer needs and the broad routes to market necessary to scale our business. Over the last couple of years, we have planned and executed significant changes to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are witnessing the positive impacts of those changes. Before I wrap up, I want to remind everyone, we have an Investor Day coming up on May 10, and I look forward to seeing you all there. Let's start the Q&A.
Operator: . Our first question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse : I guess the question relates to your June quarter outlook. I would love to hear how you're thinking about any kind of ongoing implications to both the NAND contamination issue, what kind of impact that might have on your bit availability. And then secondly, in terms of the China lockdown, the impact on your HDD media side and whether that's pushing out any shipments beyond the June quarter.
David Goeckeler : Hey, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, on the flash side, so first of all, as we said, the flash contamination issue is behind us in the fab. We expect bit growth next quarter. We won't be all the way back, but we'll -- we expect to accelerate from where we were this quarter.  As far as the situation in Penang and China, we did have that facility shut down for a couple of weeks. At the end of last quarter, we've mostly recovered that as far as the -- as being able to meet demand for this quarter. I would say that as a general statement, it's -- I think it's very difficult for everybody to meet what true demand is right now in the market. So between component shortages and the situation in China, it makes it really tough. But I think we were able to navigate through the situation quite well, quite -- frankly, the team there did a fantastic job and has kind of recovered. There were some incremental costs as we saw in the HDD margin line that we didn't expect. But all in all, I think we navigated through the situation fairly well. For the coming quarter, yes, we're still dealing with the situations in China, but we think we'll be able to navigate through, although it is very, very dynamic. But we factored in all the risks into the guide, and we're comfortable with where the number's at. Wissam, anything to add?
Wissam Jabre: Not much, David. I think you've covered it well. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers : I'll stick to 1 as well. I -- just kind of thinking about the gross margin guidance into this next quarter, I think it was 31% to 33%. I was curious if you could help kind of unpack the variables. Maybe give us some color on how you're thinking about the flash gross margin relative to the hard disk drive gross margin. And I guess within hard disk drives, how much COVID-related expenses, are you still embedding? Just any other variables you can help us appreciate on both those 2 segments.
David Goeckeler : So I'll take -- I'll start on it, and Wissam can add. So on the drive business, last quarter, we talked about the 200 basis point to 300 basis point impact that we were expecting. I think we took a little that in this quarter than we had expected. Some of that was some cost we didn't expect, like I just talked about in Shenzhen. I think I said Penang earlier, but Shenzhen. And -- so in that business, looking forward, I think we see it as pretty much -- we've pretty much hit the bottom. We basically see it flat going forward. In the flash business, we expect some acceleration of gross margin given the supply-demand balance situation. So Wissam, anything to add to that?
Wissam Jabre : Yes David, just maybe to follow-on on the comments or Aaron's question with respect to COVID, where we see the COVID costs going into next quarter are expected to be a little bit less than what we've experienced in the fiscal third quarter. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Just following up on the contamination issue. Is the 7 exabyte number that you guys talked about still the right kind of number to think about the lost production? And how does that split across the March and June quarters?
David Goeckeler: Joe, yes, that's still the right number. I mean the team will always work in kind of an evolving situation to see what they can do with the material that we had to take out. But I don't think it will be super material to the numbers. So 7 is a good place to work from. And we haven't split it up over the quarters, but the majority of it we took in the previous quarter.
Joe Moore : Okay. And your joint venture partner, I don't want to speak for them, but like just in terms of assessing the industry situation, would have lost proportionally the same amount?
David Goeckeler : Yes. I'm not going to speak for them. But we have joint manufacturing facilities, for sure. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Peter Andrew : Patrick, are you there? Why don't we skip over and try to get Patrick back in.
Operator: Okay. Our next question will go to Tom O'Malley with Barclays.
Tom O'Malley : You're seeing a really -- you're seeing a really strong trend in the HDD pricing side. Is that entirely related to the mix more towards nearline? Or are you seeing any underlying trends in other parts of the business as well? Anything helpful there would be really good.
David Goeckeler : I'll put a much larger frame on it, Tom. I think what's happening, and we see it show up in a number of ways, and there's a lot of COVID implications and costs in it, too. But I just -- I think we're just seeing the industry change from a world where there was always capacity enterprise drives available. Hard drives were available. It was about putting as many as you could in places where you could fill up factories and get good absorption and not have to pay incremental cost for that. That's kind of decline of the client era and the rise of the cloud era. We're pretty much through that, we're in the last legs of it. And I just think you're seeing a lot of industry dynamics change. You're seeing long-term agreements come in much something that last year was kind of a new concept that we were working through. Now it's becoming much more mainstream with our big customers just to give us visibility to making investments in this business. Essentially, we don't have a lot of capacity anymore to shift from client to enterprise and the cloud, and we're having to invest in that, and that's causing the whole industry to shift the way it thinks about this technology and my point of view. I think it starts with we're still driving a strong TCO model for our customers. That's where it all starts. Every generation of technology, we're able to bring down the TCO for our customers. In the past, I think as we did that, the reward for our side of it was more volume, to soak up that capacity. Well, that's not the case anymore. Now we have to invest in new volume, so the industry has to change. So we're bringing a lot of TCO value. And I think you're seeing the industry move to providing more visibility, thinking about value-based pricing more -- and how do we move that value equation in a way that we can continue to drive the TCO down and drive a better pricing environment. So that's the big picture. And then, of course, there's a lot of costs in the system right now and inflation input costs are going up, and we're working through pricing if we can mitigate parts of that. That's happening as well.
Tom O'Malley : Helpful. And if I could just sneak just another quick one in. On the flash side, obviously, you had a lot of disruptions during the quarter. It looks like the implied cost was relatively flat. When you're looking into the out quarter, you're obviously saying gross margins are up. You should see some pricing tailwinds given the industry. But Wissam, maybe any sort of color on the cost versus pricing impact in the quarter. I know you don't like to get specific, but obviously, given the situation, anything would be helpful here to kind of move on the moving pieces.
Wissam Jabre : Yes, of course. Yes, Tom. So we do expect that our long term -- to continue to reach our long-term target of cost reduction, which is 15% year-on-year. The -- we did see a bit of a headwind in the current quarter, but it's really impacted by a few factors that we expect will anticipate in the next couple of quarters. So we saw, for instance, we continue to ramp our BiCS5 technology, as well as just like everybody, we're seeing some inflationary pressure as well as the start-up of our Yokkaichi Fab7. But we still expect for this fiscal year '22 to be at least 15% year-on-year in terms of cost reduction. And as I started with, we do expect to continue to meet that target going forward.
Operator: Our next question will go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Jason on for Tim. So, could you please provide any color on the trajectory of your HDD gross margins through the second half of this year? I'm asking because we're expecting some benefit that we'll get for the -- on the stronger -- likely stronger pricing environment in the end of the first half.
David Goeckeler : Yes. We do expect -- as we talked about last quarter, we're pretty much in the same place, which is we expected the decline we saw this quarter -- we actually expected gross margin to be a little lower next quarter. Now we think that will be flat. And then we expect that to improve in the second half for a number of reasons: Mix, input costs that are changing a bit and also some pricing benefit. So yes, we expect next quarter to be the low and then we expect to improve from there. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho : I apologize before. Dave, maybe if you could give a little bit of color. You gave some very encouraging commentary regarding the data center and cloud spending into the second half of the year. One, are these because of the long-term agreements you're signing with customers? And maybe secondly, along with that question, how do you see the customer base in terms of this transition from 18 to 20? Is it a new set of customers? Or are your 18 customers quickly transitioning over to 20 terabytes?
David Goeckeler : Yes. So let me unpack that a little bit and thanks, Patrick. So -- the -- it's largely the same customers that will move from 18 to 20. I mean I think, as I said earlier, the TCO equation improves as you go -- as you keep driving forward. So it's a very part of what we do. I mean this is -- I talk about innovation a lot around here, and the innovation we've driven around ePMR and now OptiNAND and SMR, those are all things that we layer into our products and allow our customers every time they move a generation forward, they get better TCO equation. So there's reasons to keep moving forward. So that's kind of the way that works a little bit. By the way, we'll come back and talk about SMR a little bit more. We're continuing to see more momentum towards SMR. That is the future of the cloud HDD business, is SMR. All the big players are now moving down that path, which is a technology we've been investing in for quite some time. On your other question on -- look, the LTAs don't drive the spending and the LTAs help smooth out the spending. I think the whole idea with the LTA is to give -- we have a strong relationship with our big customers and to give better visibility 2, 3 quarters out. I've talked about this a lot in the past, the business used to -- if I think back a year ago or 2 years ago when I came into the business, the business was just transacted quarter-to-quarter and even within the quarter. And clearly, given the investments we need to make to continue to drive investments in heads and media to fund -- to fuel the exabyte growth, we're going to need more visibility than that. And so the LTAs have been adopted. And we strike those with our big customers on multi-quarter timeframes, and then we stick to them. And that's been very good as far as smoothing out any ups and downs in builds on their side. And so, as far as the second half environment, our big cloud customers continue to tell us and signal a strong demand environment in the second half of the year. So we'll be excited about driving to them with -- starting with 18 and then transitioning to 20 as we move through the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: It’s  for Krish. For HDDs, when do you expect the crossover between 20 terabytes and 18 terabytes? And can you please tell us if you did see slowdown in the VIA market for HDDs over the last quarter?
David Goeckeler : Yes. I would imagine the 20 crossover will be in the second half of the year. I mean we're deep into the 18s right now. I mean, 18 is probably 80% of the portfolio of shipping. So it's the sweet spot of the market. As we move through the year, we'll start to ramp 20. So towards the end of the year, early next year -- we can circle back on a specific date, but that's the way we're thinking about it. The surveillance market, smart video market, that's been soft all year. So we continue to see that with the lockdowns in China. We expect that once that ends, there'll be some snapback and some recovery of pushed out demand there. But right now, given the COVID situation, I think that, that market is not going to change until the COVID situation changes.
Unidentified Analyst: And if I can squeeze one in. Is surveillance margin accretive?
David Goeckeler : Is it -- margin. I don't think we break out of that level. I don't know, Wissam, do you have a comment on that, or Peter?
Wissam Jabre : Yes. Actually, David, we don't break out down to that level of detail.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho : A couple of short ones on the flash side. How are you thinking about your full year bit shipment growth for calendar '22? I know you don't want to go quarter-by-quarter, but for the full year. And then the follow-up question is gross margin for flash, and you talked about maybe up a little bit for next quarter. Are you actually expecting much price increase? How much is mix a factor? And maybe talk about -- Wissam you talked about the Yokkaichi start-up costs. Can you kind of quantify what that number is?
David Goeckeler : I will let Wissam handle the gross margin question. The bit growth -- look, our bit growth will be down this year. We're not going to put a fund number out there right now. But given the fab excursion, we'll be down this year. And then we'll make it up over the next year or so, a year plus. It will take a while to fully come back to our fair share of bits. Our strategy has been very consistent for a long time. We invest to maintain share. And you see us doing that, including recent fab announcements with Kioxia. Wissam, do you want to talk about gross margin a little bit in flash?
Wissam Jabre : Of course, David. So Sidney, thanks for the question. The -- when we think of the flash business, I think to address maybe the part of the question around the Yokkaichi start-up cost, they're not very significant and actually, they're much lower than the K1 fab start-up, we're talking about really a brownfield expansion here versus a greenfield expansion. To the part of your question with respect to our flash gross margin that's sort of embedded in the guidance. Of course, mix always plays a part in any gross margin, whether it's actual or projected. So -- but as I said earlier, we're still expecting to meet that 15%-plus year-on-year cost reduction for flash in the fiscal year 2022. I hope this helps.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. And just as a follow-up to the previous question, how should I think about the impact of FX exchange rate on the flash gross margin?
Wissam Jabre : So maybe I'll -- thanks, Mehdi, for the question. Then maybe I'll just talk about the FX in general. So our approach is we do -- we use a layered hedging approach, which means it's -- there's much more coverage in hedge on the shorter term versus the longer term. And so that smoothens out the impact of FX over time.  And the way also to think of it as any incurred cost within the quarter typically will not really impact the P&L until approximately 90 to 120 days later, given the manufacturing cycle times and lead time for delivery of product. And so the -- whatever we're seeing at least in the past short term in terms of currency fluctuations, will not be that impactful to the numbers. What we saw in -- what we're sort of expecting -- actually, what we saw in this quarter and what we're anticipating for the fiscal fourth quarter is less than 1% impact on all of our cost of goods sold. Not on -- that basically talks about all of the costs of goods sold, maybe not only the flash portion.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Can I not answer a question? Is FX more like a clarification?
David Goeckeler : So far, Mehdi.
Mehdi Hosseini : Just back to David, given your LTAs and you sound confident that the cloud demand is going to sustain into the second half. How should we think about nearline exabyte growth prospect in calendar year '22 versus '21?
David Goeckeler : Exabyte growth in '22 versus '21, I can get you -- let me look this up real quick. If I have a pie -- look, I mean, Mehdi, if I look at it -- looking at over -- we keep coming back to 35% growth in the -- in exabytes in the cloud. That's been a pretty consistent number. I'd have to go back and put it in -- I tend to look at it more in fiscal years and calendar years, but I can follow up with you on a calendar year number.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And I look forward to meeting you at the Analyst Day.
David Goeckeler : I look forward to it. It's going to be fun.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.
Nik Todorov : David, you talked about SMR quite a bit on this call. Maybe can you unpack how should we think about the impact on SMR on mix, pricing and margins, and HDD. Maybe can you touch on what kind of workloads are the cloud guys looking to deploy some more initially?
David Goeckeler : Well, I'll defer the workloads until our Investor Day. We'll go into a little more detail there. But look, I think big picture, we see this last quarter, I think -- well, I know I said we had 2 big cloud titans that we're working on SMR and we expected significant shipments towards the end of the year. Within the quarter, we had another one and another one come to us about adopting SMR. So I think that -- I think that it's very clear to me that the capacity gains that can be achieved with SMR, we've been investing in this technology for a long time and this idea that you can get an extra 10% or more. And again, we'll talk about that next week -- or in a couple of weeks as well. It's very attractive, especially given the size of the drives now and how big they are, you're talking big numbers, multiple terabytes that are being added through the changes.  Now, the thing that gives me a lot of conviction on this is because it requires the -- on the host side, you have to do some software work. And nobody wants to do software work if they can avoid it or if the return is not good enough. And the fact that the big players are coming in, they're saying, look, we're going to invest in this, and we're going to pull SMR into our data centers, tells me that this is the next leg of growth in this industry. So again, we'll get to our Investor Day to talk about what it means on the portfolio, but I get back to just another way that allows us using innovation to drive a better TCO equation for our customers. And when we can drive better TCO, then we can leverage that into a conversation about value-based pricing. And that's exactly what we're doing, and that's -- it's exactly where the industry is going. And like I said, LTAs are a part of that, about getting more predictability. But the fact that we can continue to drive down the cost of storage, continue to drive a better TCO with every generation of products, to do that through innovation, that gives us opportunity to create margin and create value.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nam Kim with Arete Research.
Nam Kim : How should we think about some of your hyperscaler moving into their own enterprise SSD build? Do you expect such DIY enterprise SSD to impact your business negatively or just have a limited impact? Any color would be great.
David Goeckeler : I think various of our customers have DIY projects. I think that's fine. They still -- first of all, I don't know if anybody does 100% fab, because everybody wants diversity in their supply chain. But even DIY provides us opportunity to provide, well NAND, so not just the full enterprise SSD. But like I said, even anybody that's doing DIY is also going to be buying enterprise SSDs as well for part of their footprint. And the numbers here are getting so large that whichever way you play or both. It gives us the opportunity to play in both of those franchises, quite frankly, with our big customers, providing enterprise SSDs and then providing NAND into their projects. So I think it's a reflection of how important enterprise SSDs are to the future of a very modern cloud data center. It's extraordinarily important technology, and we're very happy to be involved with the biggest customers and qualified at the biggest customers with our technology.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva : Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you all next month. But before that, it's great to see that the contamination issue is kind of behind us, of course, working through that. With that being said, the cost of all that, is that solely borne by Western Digital? Or does your supplier kind of remunerate you for that, or make up for it in future pricing or some type of insurance? And most critically, what are you doing? Have you put in something to make sure such thing doesn't happen again?
David Goeckeler : Yes, I'll give some input when we so can maybe provide more details if we have them. But look, we -- the issue is fully behind us. The team has done a fantastic job of root causing it down to the very, very bones of what the issues are, and then putting in place -- obviously putting in place screens and other things to make sure it doesn't happen again. Or if it does happen again to make sure we catch it proactively. As far as the costs are split by us and our JV partner and as far as the ability to recoup any of those, I mean, I think we'll look at that. Once we get fully passed anything, we'll look and see if there's anything that will happen there. Anything to add to that, Wissam?
Wissam Jabre: I think -- no, David, I think you've covered it well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox.
Steven Fox : I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the hard disk drive pricing. So as you mentioned, your ASPs were up 4% in the quarter. But can you talk a little bit about the like-for-like pricing currently and for the rest of the year, how you're approaching it maybe differently by the different segments. And whether it's being impacted by the sort of extended lead times you've talked about in terms of where you're maybe putting more bits than maybe you were a year ago. 
David Goeckeler : I think, like I said, we're working on -- I want to repeat the same thing. Again, pricing starts with value. We have to deliver value, and we're constantly innovating to deliver more value. But we're clearly working on pricing to see -- to defray some of the input costs and all the logistics costs has impacted. So that's going on across the portfolio. And then we're having conversations with our customers about the value we're providing with these next generation of drives about what that value is and how do we move to a value-based pricing model. I don't know if there's a whole lot more to say about it than that. I don't know, Wissam, anything from your perspective?
Wissam Jabre : No, not on this, David. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.
Christian Schwab : I just have a quick question on disk drive gross margins. Given the positive impacts of mix and decreased input costs and  value pricing, if we have a China COVID shutdown end, is there any reason why the disk drive business can't be operating at  plus growth exiting calendar year?
David Goeckeler : I'm sorry, you broke up when you said the number.
Christian Schwab : Is there any reason you could -- you wouldn't be exiting the calendar year with gross margins at 30% plus again?
David Goeckeler : Yes. I mean, so I think we broke those numbers out. Wissam, I think he's got the details, he had it in his remarks. But I mean, if you just took all the COVID cost of business right now, I think we'd be about 30%, right, Wissam?
Wissam Jabre : Yes. So that's very true, David. I mean the -- we did have in the quarter around 240 basis points related to the COVID costs. We've talked about slightly impacted, of course, by COVID lockdowns. We continue to see some inflationary cost pressures short term with supply chain disruptions. The -- I mean, to your question, I wouldn't necessarily want to talk about where the margins are going to be in Q4. But would it say that we do expect the margins to be better from here in the second half of the calendar year '22.
David Goeckeler : Yes. It was -- I mean we're not going to commit to your number, but just as a general point, I mean, look, there's just been a lot of a lot of additional costs on the business. We've talked about it for many quarters now, logistics costs and now increased input costs that have really hit us this past quarter. And you would think as the world comes out of the pandemic, I think which is the major crux to your point, as this starts to unwind and logistics gets back to a steady state, and some of the input costs get more reasonable, we stop paying expedite fees for certain components and things like that because there's just a more smooth flowing supplier ecosystem. It will unburden a lot of costs on the business. And again, I think this is masking somewhat, although not completely, a major fundamental structural change that's going on in the business, which I've talked about a lot, which is the HDD market is a growth market, and it's a growth market where we're going to need to invest capital to build additional heads and media capacity. And when that happens, I think the economic equation changes, and we get -- the key thing in that kind of world is can you still innovate and can you still bring new things to the product that makes it more valuable to your customer? And I think that is what we've really been focused on, from ePMR to OptiNAND to SMR, we're just really focused on innovation, bring a better value proposition that will be able to build a better product for our customers, and we'll get into that value-based pricing thing. So if we get both of those going and we can get the cost out because of the pandemic, I think we'll -- we feel very good about the business.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark Company.
Mark Miller : I'm just wondering in terms of mix, NAND mix, how is that progressing in terms of mobile versus the other segment you ship into? Are you seeing increasingly more shipments in the mobile? And where do you expect that's going?
David Goeckeler : There's a couple of dynamics to this. I think over the -- looking -- the past couple of quarters, we had a higher shift -- higher mix towards mobile as we were ramping BiCS5. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've gotten past our qualifications of BiCS5 in the consumer market, and in our client SSD market. So we see an acceleration of mix into those on BiCS5. And then there's a lot of hard work going on to qualify our enterprise SSDs on BiCS5. And as that happens throughout this year, then you'll see an acceleration of that market as well into BiCS5. The reality is we have demand on enterprise SSD. We can't meet because it's on BiCS4 right now. So as we get that into BiCS5, you'll see the mix change, and you'll see the enterprise SSD mix accelerate through the second half of the year, which will provide a tailwind to business. This -- we'll talk about this a little bit more at Investor Day as well to put one more plug in to see all of you on the 10th.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities.
Kevin Cassidy : Yes, looking forward to May 10 and May 9. I just wondered if you could give us a little more details on the Fab7 ramp. What what's -- you've mentioned brownfield as production. And can I just understand a little better what that means? Is it -- you start off with only 20,000 wafers a month or, any numbers like that you can give us? 
David Goeckeler : So first of all, let me clarify the brownfield. I think what the point Wissam was making there was that K2 expenses will not be at the level of K1 because K1 was a greenfield and K2 is a brownfield. So -- the same situation with Y7, which ramping in Yokkaichi, obviously a brownfield launch there as well. Wissam may have some information about how the expenses roll out. As far as how the wafer scale, we'll start ramping that, I think, on our newer nodes, but we'll have more to say about that when we start getting the tools in there and all of that. I don't know, Wissam, anything to add?
Wissam Jabre : Yes. The -- just maybe to clarify thanks, to clarify the -- my comment on brownfield versus greenfield was exactly just to really highlight that the costs aren't as high as we've seen in K1. They weren't really -- they're not very significant. But of course, it's a bit of a headwind to the gross margin.
Operator: Thank you. Speakers, I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Goeckeler for any closing remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. As we've said a couple of times, we look forward to seeing -- hopefully, we'll see you on May 9 as was pointed out for some new product launches. We'll have some exciting new technology coming out then. And then on the 10th -- May 10, May 9 and 10, on the 10th, we'll have our Investor Day, which we've been looking forward to for quite some time. So we will see you there. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-01-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital’s Fiscal Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, we will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, trends and financial outlook based on management’s current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2022 results. We delivered strong results for the fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $4.8 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 33.6%, both of which are within the guidance range we provided last quarter. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, which was ahead of our expectations. I am proud of the team as this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding guidance amid a continuously increasingly challenged supply chain. Before I go over the detailed results and business trends, I want to offer some important key takeaways coming out of calendar year 2021. First, we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio. We delivered on our goals of qualifying our enterprise SSD products at 3 cloud titans and 2 OEMs, commercializing energy-assisted hard drives as well as commencing shipments of 20-terabyte hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. These products address the large and fast growing opportunities within the cloud for storage. Second, demand for Western Digital storage solutions across cloud, client and consumer end markets remains consistently strong. We are optimistic about our outlook for calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate solid demand across the end markets we serve. I will share more about that demand and other macro factors later. Third, we are continuing to navigate an increasingly complex supply chain, which is impacting both our customers’ ability to ship products as well as our ability to build products. In order to meet our end customers’ demand, we are incurring additional costs that will weigh primarily on our hard drive gross margins through the first half of calendar year 2022. These issues are transitory in nature, affecting both revenue and gross margin and we expect them to subside as the supply chain normalizes. We remain confident that the long-term growth and profitability opportunity in front of us has not changed. Lastly, we received an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch in December, which represents Western Digital’s second investment grade corporate rating. This marks an important milestone as we have worked hard over the last 18 months to strengthen our financial position, providing us with greater financial flexibility in the future. As we approach our targeted debt levels, we look forward to reengaging in a capital return program in fiscal year 2023. Turning to our results, this past quarter, demand remained strong across our end markets and our customers and the Western Digital teams continue to work diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. In particular, cloud revenue for the fiscal second quarter increased by 89% from the same period last year. We continue to anticipate strength in storage demand, which is bolstered by our ability to continue to bring innovative new products to market to meet the needs of the digital economy. The potential of what can be accomplished through the creation of content and the ability to access digital information easily has never been greater. With our technology, we are enabling businesses, creators and innovators to think bigger and push their limits even further. Western Digital has built a great position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to innovate and develop a balanced portfolio, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a strong position to capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead of us. I will now recap our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, overall cloud end-market product demand remained high, with revenue increasing 50% year-over-year led by capacity enterprise hard drives. Although we were up strongly year-over-year, capacity enterprise hard drives declined sequentially after two quarters of strong shipments, partly due to some of our customers’ supply chain challenges. As both Western Digital earned customers continue to face supply chain challenges, we will experience some near-term visibility issues. However, our overall demand signals continue to be very good as we move through the calendar year and we will be in a stronger position once these headwinds subside. During the fiscal second quarter, we commenced volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. We are very excited about OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the control plane to further increase areal density. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in customer interest in adopting SMR technology and expect multiple cloud titans to deploy SMR drives in high volume later in this calendar year. In Flash, revenue grew in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal strength in mobile and consumer. Within mobile, shipments of our BiCS5 products into leading 5G smartphones increased over 60% sequentially and 50% year-over-year, led by strong content growth. BiCS5 shipments represented over 40% of total revenue and BiCS5 production crossover took place during the quarter as expected. The successful ramp of BiCS5 helped accelerate our overall year-over-year bit shipment growth to 37% in the quarter. Our WD_BLACK premium SSD product line optimized for the best gaming experience continues to gain momentum, with revenue increasing about 50% sequentially and doubling in calendar year 2021. Along with flash products for gaming consoles, revenue has grown from 0 to over 10% of our flash portfolio over the last 2 years. As consumers demand more ways to access, generate and store content, whether via gaming or the now emerging Metaverse, our strong and growing flash portfolio will be integral to enable all of these applications. In line with the guidance we provided last quarter, our client SSD business declined sequentially due to supply chain disruptions at some of our PC customers and pricing pressure in the more transactional markets. So far, within the current quarter, we are starting to see pricing in the more transactional markets stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise SSD products are qualified at 3 cloud titans and 2 major storage OEMs, marking significant progress compared to 1 cloud titan a year ago. As you know, this has been one of my top priorities. Building upon the early success of ramping BiCS5 into mobile and gaming consoles, we are further strengthening our product portfolio as we move through calendar year 2022. In client SSD, the bedrock of Western Digital’s flash portfolio, we have launched and are ramping BiCS5-based products in the fiscal third quarter, with BiCS5 enterprise SSD products later in the year. For our next-generation 3D flash, we began initial commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our 162-layer BiCS6. Furthermore, we qualified and commenced revenue shipment of client SSDs based on QLC and BiCS5 technology in the fiscal second quarter. While still early in its evolution, we are starting to pave the way for the industry’s adoption of QLC in the future and our next-generation BiCS6 node will play an important role in that evolution. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. The accelerated digital transformation in the last 2 years has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. We anticipate these trends will continue to drive data storage growth across each end market we serve: cloud, client and consumer. Our customers remain optimistic about demand trends in calendar 2022, driven by capital investment for the cloud build-out, continued recovery in enterprise spending, growth in smart video applications, increased adoption in 5G phones, consumer gaming and emerging trends such as VR/AR devices. In cloud, our customers have announced a 36% year-over-year increase in capital investment for the cloud build-out. This coupled with an increase in enterprise spending and continued growth in smart video applications, is expected to drive growth for our flash and HDD products into this growing end market. In client, PC end demand has remained strong. Our customers are driving more consistent demand than the past several quarters and we see continued stabilization in 2022. PC unit shipment forecasts continue to be robust and significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we anticipate an eventual return to site to drive a mix shift towards commercial PCs, which tend to offer richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, the latest 5G phones have doubled NAND content from prior generation smartphones. We expect mobile device content to benefit as ongoing 5G adoption and new 5G-enabled applications are expected to drive the storage demand in both endpoints in the cloud. In consumer, the highlight of this end market is our WD_BLACK SSD line of products optimized for gaming enthusiasts. Revenue more than doubled in calendar year 2021. The consumer recognition of the strength and value of WD_BLACK, along with the SanDisk and SanDisk Professional brands, drove a 34% year-over-year growth in average capacity per unit in consumer flash. While end customer demand in calendar 2022 looks promising, supply chain challenges are increasing. This both limits our ability to source components to meet customer demand and increases component costs. These costs are on top of the ongoing elevated logistics and health and safety COVID costs. While we believe these incremental costs are transitory and will subside as the supply chain conditions normalize, they will impact our results through the first half of this calendar year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for calendar year 2022. Bob?
Bob Eulau: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were better than our expectations, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that we have met or exceeded guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Please note that this figure includes $70 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I will provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of ongoing supply chain issues and COVID-related challenges. In addition to this solid financial performance, we hit a major milestone this quarter in receiving an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch. This marks the company’s second investment grade corporate rating. We are pleased to see that our work to build a stronger financial foundation is being recognized and is providing us with greater financial flexibility for the future. Additionally, we closed a public debt offering last December and amended our loan agreement with lenders in January, bringing the maturity of over 85% of our debt balance to 2026 and beyond. For more details, please refer to our earnings presentation. Turning to our end markets, cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.9 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 89% from a year ago. Supply chain disruptions impacted cloud hard drive deployments at certain customers, which led to a sequential decline in exabyte shipments in the fiscal second quarter. However, healthy overall demand for capacity enterprise drives, along with Western Digital’s leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point, drove a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in exabyte shipments. The client end market represented 38% of total revenue at $1.9 billion flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. The continued ramp of 5G phones helped offset decline in both client SSD and client hard drive revenue, enabling total client revenue to stay flat. Client hard drives represent less than 15% of our HDD revenue. Lastly, consumer represented 22% of revenue at $1.1 billion, up 9% sequentially and flat year-over-year. With a strong holiday season, retail flash led the sequential growth in consumer. On a year-over-year basis, growth in consumer flash was offset by a decline in consumer HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment, we reported flash revenue of $2.6 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 6% sequentially due to a seasonal increase in shipments to mobile and retail. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially. Flash bit shipments increased by 13% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments decreased by 14%, while the average price per hard drive decreased by 5% to $97. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 27%. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 33.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. As noted earlier, the COVID-related impact was $10 million higher than we anticipated at $70 million. Our flash gross margin was 36.1%, down 0.9 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $10 million or approximately 0.4 percentage points. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $60 million or approximately 2.7 percentage points. Operating expenses of $741 million were below our guidance range due to prudent cost control and lower variable compensation expense. Operating income was $882 million, representing a 7% decrease from the prior quarter and 157% increase year-over-year, highlighting our ability to drive profitable growth. Earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $666 million, and free cash flow was $407 million. Despite a slight increase in inventory due to supply chain disruption, we maintained strong cash flow generation in the quarter. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, with a cash outflow of $259 million. We remain prudent in investing in manufacturing capacity and continue to expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $3 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be around $1.5 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we fully repaid our Term Loan B in the amount of $943 million last October. In addition, last December, we closed a public offering of $1 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $1.3 billion on our Term Loan A, bringing our gross debt outstanding to $7.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. On top of that, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to revise the terms of our loan agreement to reflect our improved credit ratings and to extend the maturity of our term loan and revolving credit facility from 2023 to 2027. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5x. This compares to 3.0x in the third fiscal quarter of 2020, when we announced the plan to focus on debt repayment to achieve greater financial flexibility. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Considering the transitory supply chain challenges we discussed earlier, I would like to provide a bit more color on our view of both hard drive and Flash businesses in calendar 2022. Within our hard drive segment, we expect hard drive revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the third fiscal quarter. While the supply chain disruptions at some of our customers are expected to remain, the larger issue of late has been our ability to source components to meet customer demand. We expect revenue to return to sequential growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While overall hard drive pricing is expected to remain relatively stable, we expect gross margins to decline 2 to 3 percentage points from the fiscal second quarter through the fiscal fourth quarter due primarily to component cost inflation. Within our Flash segment, we expect Flash revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the fiscal third quarter driven by ASP. We expect Flash revenue to return to growth in the second half of calendar year 2022. Furthermore, we anticipate downward pressure on gross margins for the first half of this calendar year as cost reductions revert towards our long-term target of 15%. In regard to our fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.65 billion with a sequential revenue decline for both Flash and hard drive businesses. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect operating expenses to be between $750 million and $770 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the third quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.80 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 318 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I’ll now turn the call back over to Dave.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Bob. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook in calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. Despite the transitory issues we discussed earlier, it is clearer than ever that we have the right foundation for long-term growth and the right technology portfolio in place to ensure that we are successful in scaling our business. Over the last couple of years, we have made significant changes necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I’m excited that we are starting to see the fruits of those changes. Before I finish today, I’d like to take a moment to comment on the CFO transition we announced earlier this afternoon. As you may have seen, we announced that Wissam Jabre will be joining Western Digital as Chief Financial Officer effective the week of February 7. Wissam was most recently Chief Financial Officer at Dialog Semiconductor. In addition to his deep financial and semiconductor expertise, Wissam also has technical expertise, and importantly, shares Western Digital’s values of collaboration and innovation. You can read more about his background in the press release issued today. I’d like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of the entire Board and management team to Bob for his dedication and hard work at the service of Western Digital. During my tenure as CEO, I’ve greatly benefited from his friendship and expertise. He’s been an essential part of our leadership team, guiding key aspects of our strategy. Among many other contributions, Bob drove a capital allocation strategy that has led to significant repayment of our debt, marked this quarter by Western Digital’s second investment-grade corporate rating. Bob’s insight was also instrumental in helping us navigate COVID uncertainty and execute other strategic changes at the company to position us for growth and value creation. Next quarter, you’ll have an opportunity to hear from Wissam. I know he’s looking forward to it. With that, Peter, let’s begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to dive into, obviously, the hard disk drive results. I mean, by my math, it looks like your capacity shift in nearline declined by about high teens or even 20% sequential. Can you help dissect the impact of your larger cloud customers having their own supply constraints relative to the comment of your own component availability? And then on top of that, gross margin in this next quarter, I know you alluded to, but how much COVID costs are you factoring into the gross margin expectation with 2 to 3 percentage points decline? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Okay. I’ll take a crack at it. Aaron thanks for the question and thanks for joining us, as always. So I don’t think it was quite down quite as much as you said. I think we’re kind of like mid-teens. A big piece of that is, we talked about it last quarter, we have one very, very large customer that’s going through some challenges of their own. And now we have issues with our own supply chain. So I would say in the last quarter, it was primarily on the customer side. And as we went through the quarter, it started to creep in on our own components. And as we move into the next quarter, it’s much more of a component issue as the rest of the market normalizes out or the customer normalizes out. On the COVID costs, you saw they are going up, and I’ll let Bob comment through this in more detail. But the health and safety and logistics costs continue to go up. We’ve seen that over the last couple of quarters, and now we’re seeing component costs that are almost approaching that same level of spend as far as increases. So I thought I’d give you some idea of sizing it. But Bob, you want to...
Bob Eulau: Yes. I can add a little more detail. I think that the COVID costs we’ve been reporting, which are the logistics costs and the costs in the factory associated with keeping our employees safe, probably peaked in the second fiscal quarter at the $70 million. I think it will come down some in the third quarter, and hopefully, continue to come down from there. The logistics costs, as you know, have been elevated for probably at least six quarters now. The thing that’s different as we look at the next quarter or two are the component costs, and we’re seeing a lot of inflationary pressures on the component costs. We think those are transitory, a lot of expedite fees, a lot of expenses associated with trying to get the parts in so we can get the products built and delivered. So I think that’s really what’s different as we look forward the next quarter or two.
David Goeckeler: The other thing, Aaron, I’ll just wrap up by saying, I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we’re expecting right about on seasonality for our hard drive business. I would say earlier – midway through last quarter, we were hoping to do better than that because we saw the demand there. But there is a significant amount of unmet demand that we just can’t meet given the component constraints. But even with all that included, we believe we’re back on a more seasonal number.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, thank you.
David Goeckeler: Sure, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess to follow-up on Aaron’s question, can you speak to when you expect these constraints to no longer be a headwind? And as part of the higher component costs, is there a point in time where you can – where contracts can be renegotiated and you can increase those higher input costs in terms of your pricing?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So there is – first of all, thanks for the question and thanks for joining us again. There is a lot to unpack in that question. Let me take a bit of a crack at it. So the component constraints are not necessarily new. We’ve been dealing with them for a long time. I think early in the pandemic, we were able to qualify additional component suppliers, diversify. And then as things went on, we would always remix and do what we could to get the most out of the components we could get. It’s just gotten to the point now where it’s getting even more constrained. And quite frankly, a little bit more surprises that orders that we thought were going to show up get either delayed or canceled. So we continue to work through that. So to your point, there is a number of dynamics about why it gets better. One, we stay very close to our suppliers, and we will obviously work many quarters into the future. And we can see as we get through the first half of the year, things get better. We also – the technology moves forward. And in some cases, we just move on to different nodes in the semiconductor business that have more availability on them. So we know as the portfolio shifts, things are going to free up. And then to your point, the longer it goes, we can negotiate longer contracts and kind of look at the relationship with all of our suppliers to get back to a position where we have more predictability both on the supply side and on the pricing side of it.
C.J. Muse: That’s very helpful. And as my follow-up on the NAND side of things, I think you’ve historically talked about the transactional market kind of as a leading indicator. And so curious, as you look into March, how are you thinking about pricing? And I know you don’t guide pricing, but curious, is there a larger headwind like-for-like or on a blended basis as you sit here today and consider the likely mix?
David Goeckeler: I would say pricing is – look, I mean, I said it in the script. Pricing has stabilized in the more transactional markets. I think there was a little bit – I think the narrative in the industry given some of the shutdowns that are going on, would it flow through immediately? We haven’t seen that. But we did see a stabilization. Also it’s worth noting that majority of the portfolio is priced before we go into the quarter, and that happened before any of the events of the shutdowns in China. So that’s not going to show up for another quarter or two. But I would say we’re seeing more stabilization. Our view, I think, has been that we will see better pricing in the second half, and that’s pretty much the way it’s playing out. Depending on kind of the impacts of some of the shutdowns, that may move forward a little bit. But I think mainly the impacts of what we’ve seen – impact on NAND pricing is going to be more second half favorable, including some of the stuff we’re seeing now on even the tool vendors, the component issues hitting them. So we’re watching that very closely. I would say right now, we’ve got a more stable environment over the last 2, 3 weeks.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Just following up on the NAND question, you guys have been going through this BiCS5 transition, and I know part of that has sort of – as you’re waiting for controllers and qualifications that you end up in those more transactional markets. Where are you from a mix standpoint? Is that still a negative impact in the March quarter? And do you see that at some point reversing as you start to get traction in other markets with BiCS5?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Joe, thanks for the question. So definitely, as we go through the year, the mix gets better on BiCS5. It starts out in more transactional markets. Consumer, it’s moved into mobile, it’s into gaming. This quarter, we will start to ramp client and then more of that as we go through the year. And then in the second half of the year, we will ramp BiCS5 into enterprise SSD. And that’s really where the whole enterprise SSD story comes together. We’ve got – this year, we went through all the qualifications. That’s BiCS4 material right now, which is in shorter supply. And then as we ramp that into BiCS5 throughout the year, the mix gets better as we go throughout the year. So it’s a really important point and one of the reasons why when we talk about the setup for 2022, as we go forward, the portfolio gets stronger.
Joe Moore: Great. And then in NAND, I don’t know if you mentioned because I’ve been on multiple calls, but have you had constraints from SSD controllers as well as HDD and power management, anything else that’s constraining on the NAND side of the business?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I would say the NAND – the business we’re leaving on the table in the NAND business is higher than in the drive business. It’s significant in the drive business, in the order of $100 million to $150 million in the third quarter there. But in the Flash business, it’s basically twice that. So yes, it’s controllers, it’s power ICs, it’s a number of different parts on enterprise SSDs and embedded as well.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Sure. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. It’s great to see crossover of BiCS5 this quarter. But may you discuss the timing of ramping BiCS6? I ask given your plans to reduce cash CapEx and expectations for a moderation in NAND cost declines. And I have a follow-up, please.
David Goeckeler: So we expect – so first of all, let me talk about how we think about ramping different nodes. I mean the main thing we’re looking at is the cost side of it. So the cost numbers, good again this quarter. We expect that to revert closer to the $15 million that we always talk about modeling. It’s been above it, I think, for nine quarters in a row now. But still, the nodes are producing, and we’re getting the cost we need as we go forward. We – BiCS4 was a great node for us on yields, record yields. We expect BiCS5 to be – that BiCS5 is the most capital-efficient node the team has ever built. And so at this point, we expect BiCS6 to be in FY ‘23 type of ramp. We’ve got lots of runway on BiCS5.
Karl Ackerman: I appreciate that. For my follow-up, there have been some investor concerns that channel inventory has been increasing for non-enterprise hard drives and retail areas of the NAND market. I’m curious whether that’s the case for you. It doesn’t appear that way given the constraints you are seeing from a component perspective. But if you could just discuss the level of visibility and the amount of channel inventory you see or the leanness of that, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I don’t think it’s anything noteworthy that’s particularly out of the norm across the portfolio. We talked a little bit about some stuff last quarter that’s normalized. So there is really nothing to call out. I don’t know Bob, is there anything to come to mind from your perspective?
Bob Eulau: No. I think we’re within normal ranges in every region.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Karl.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. I want to go back to the supply chain dynamics for HDD. And now, that – two follow-ups here, now that you’re actually impacted by component shortages, is that – if you were willing to pay a higher premium, would you actually be able to procure the components you needed? Is that just holding going on in the supply chain or just the parts are not available, no matter how much a premium you’re willing to pay? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Well, I think there is a premium to get them. And so we have good contracts with our suppliers. So – but there are premiums to get the pieces. But like I said, there is just more variability on timing, especially in the fact that orders that have been placed many, many, many quarters in advance, then we get push-outs. I think your question is, are we just not paying for them? Are they available? And I think it’s a mix. I mean we’re definitely – we definitely have to pay more to get what we need, and there are some pieces that are just getting delayed and – especially later in the planning cycle where it’s more difficult to mitigate the impacts.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. And a follow-up to that, when I look at your December quarter, you were impacted by one particular customer, and now it’s a supply chain issue. Does that mean that we should expect a step-function in your HDD shipment, especially into the September quarter, or is the recovery in recouping these loss shipment and revenue is going to be more gradual?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Well, look, let’s talk about it. I mean I think we are back on seasonality as we go into Q1. We obviously have a margin impact. We expect the revenue – Q3 to be the bottom on the revenue in that business. I think the margin will probably hit the bottom in the next quarter, but we will see some sequential growth. What I can say is when we look at calendar Q2, calendar Q3 through the end of the year, the demand signals from our customers are very strong. So, assuming we get the parts and like I said, especially in the drive business, as the portfolio transitions, we move on to different nodes that are freer as far as getting the controllers. That’s why we have more confidence in the second half of the year.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And Bob, good – best of luck in your next endeavor.
Bob Eulau: Alright. Thanks, Mehdi.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Mehdi.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I have got two as well. Dave, I guess you have been focused on, I guess shifting your ACD business from a more kind of transactional business to one that’s more perhaps a little bit more strategic and longer term in terms of how you engage with your customers. Any progress on the LTA front over the past couple of quarters?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think the business is definitely changing. I mean we have talked about this for a couple of years. And let me just frame it up as a kind of where we were when we walked into 2021 and where are we when we walk into 2022. And so as we go into ‘22, we are clearly – we clearly have strong customer demand. I mean in the first quarter, we have more demand than we can meet. We have customers asking us for upsides. And we get good demand signals as we move through the year. The LTA percentage to your point, are multi-quarter agreements. I am starting to say a little more precise. On the drive business, when we walked into ‘21, we had – we knew were maybe a low to mid-single percent of our exabytes were going to go through agreements. And as we walk into ‘22, that’s more like a third of the portfolio. So, you have seen a dramatic – we have seen a dramatic difference in what we understand about how much our customers are going to take, especially the biggest of the big customers, what their demand is going to look like, what are they committing to. That obviously helps us plan, that helps us work on pricing. So, it’s a very, very different situation. From a portfolio point of view, we walked into calendar year ‘21 when we were talking about commercializing energy-assist. We walk into ‘22 not only having commercialized energy-assist and got the areal density gains from it, we have also launched OptiNAND. We got back on our front foot with 18 and ramped that. Now we are ramping 20. Something we talked about in the script, which has evolved over the year is we are seeing much more interest now from the big customers in SMR. That’s something we have been investing in for many years. We have always thought it’s been good technology. OptiNAND helps deliver a better SMR drive and better areal density. And we expect by the end of the year, we are going to have multiple cloud titans deploying SMR at scale. On the flash side of the business, we talked about BiCS5 and kind of where we are there and how that portfolio gets stronger throughout the year. And then I think as we go through ‘22, we are just in a better financial situation than we were before. To the – and as we talked about on the call, getting back to a shareholder return policy, which we are all very much looking forward to as we move into FY ‘23. So, maybe a little broader than your question, sorry, but we – LTAs in the drive business have become a meaningful increase in the percent of our exabytes and where they are going to be placed throughout the year.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. That’s super helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, Dave, you mentioned at the very end of your response on the shareholder return aspect of the business, it’s next fiscal year, which is great. What’s sort of the internal debate when you think about dividend versus share repurchases? And just given the evolving macro backdrop and sort of the rate backdrop, any change in how you think about and how you approach capital allocation at a high level? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think we will have more to say about that as we get a little bit closer. I mean one of the things we are going to do is talk to our shareholders and get their input on that question, and then we will have more to say about it. So, I don’t know if it’s an internal debate just yet, but we are just really looking forward to getting to that point. We have spent 18 months now paying down well over $2 billion worth of debt. We have the ability – we have made a lot of changes in our execution in the portfolio to generate more cash, and we are looking forward to returning that to our shareholders.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks a lot. This is Jason Park on for Tim Arcuri. So, just I have one question. My question is on HDD. So, we just wanted to ask how your 20 terabyte is ramping throughout this calendar year. As you guys know, your competitor provided some color on this last night, saying there is 20 terabyte will be one of the fastest ramp ever. So, if you guys could provide any details on how your 18 terabyte and 20 terabyte ramp is going this year, that would be helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. 20 is – I guess what I would say is 20 terabyte is ramping. It’s not going to ramp. It is ramping. I mean if I look at units shipped in the last quarter, we are up to a high-single digit percent already of units that are going out at 20 terabyte. And like I said, we see high interest because we have some very, very large customers going to SMR. And so you are going to get more bang for your buck there with the gains you get on SMR. And OptiNAND is a technology that makes that even more efficient. So, we feel really good about where 20 terabyte is. We feel good about where the technology is. And we think it’s going to be a very successful ramp. I will just leave it at that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi Dave and Bob. Just a question here, on your March quarter flash guide, I think you talked about price might be a little bit – pricing will be a little bit softer. Wondering, mix should be more positive for you guys, right, because mobile probably comes in and you have a better mix of, it might be retail and enterprise, etcetera. So, I was wondering why margins wouldn’t be more stable in the flash side in the March quarter. And also, I think you mentioned component cost inflation. I was wondering if this is actual component costs or logistics costs, or what exactly the component cost inflation was? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: So, on the second one, it’s actual component cost. Like what the suppliers mix of cost is a different thing. I mean obviously, wafers are going up. But for us, it’s just the cost of the component itself. On your mix question, yes, mix gets better as we go forward because we go more into BiCS5 and more parts of the portfolio. I guess what I will say is the component impact on the portfolio – I mean one of the places the component impact on flash is hitting the portfolio is on enterprise HDD, which is…
Peter Andrew: Enterprise SSD.
David Goeckeler: Enterprise SSD. Thank you, Peter. Enterprise SSD. So anyway, the component impact on the portfolio is a – component shortage impact on the portfolio is part of the equation there as well.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tom O’Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O’Malley: Hi. Good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my question. I just had two on the HDD business. One, I think, David, you have talked about seasonality or a more seasonal march. You have obviously seen some marches over the past 2 years that I would classify as less seasonal. Could you remind us what seasonality traditionally looks like in that business? And then the second one is you talked about gross margins over the next two quarters, going down 200 basis points to 300 basis points in the HDD business. Could you give us any color on the cadence there? Do you see a sharp fall off in March and a flattening in June, or is it a step-function for both quarters? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: First question…
Bob Eulau: Was on seasonality.
David Goeckeler: Right, seasonality, about 4%, right?
Bob Eulau: For the company overall, yes, usually down about 4% in the March quarter.
David Goeckeler: And then, Bob, do you want to comment on gross margin, what it looks like in…
Peter Andrew: HDD.
David Goeckeler: In HDD fiscal Q3, fiscal Q4?
Bob Eulau: Yes. Well, as I mentioned, we have two big headwinds right now. The one we have had for a while, which are the COVID costs, and we hope they peaked in the December quarter. We think they peaked in the December quarter at about $70 million, and it will come down some from there. The logistics costs have been persistent for quite a while. So, I think it really comes down to when we see more passenger traffic coming out of Asia, which will be able to get the cargo rates down. So, that’s one headwind we continue to have. And then on the component costs, I mean it’s – we are really expecting those to persist through the fourth quarter. And we expect them to get better as we go through the year, as Dave mentioned, as some of the controllers get on different nodes and we are able to see more supply available. But I think through the fourth quarter, we will continue to have a challenge.
Tom O’Malley: Thanks for the color.
Bob Eulau: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Probably a question for Bob, but when you talk about those COVID costs kind of peaking, I think you said December quarter peaking. Can they come off pretty quickly if the COVID pandemic ends up for spring and summer kind of going away and critical mass of people overcome it? Just kind of curious about how quick they can go away, or is that too optimistic to think that they could go away, hopefully as fast as warmer temperatures come around?
Bob Eulau: Yes. I mean I think that – as I mentioned, the real driver is there is very little passenger traffic coming out of Asia right now. And so there is a lot of cargo on those flights in normal times. So, obviously, we are seeing good indications. A lot of the countries are starting to open up and say they are going to open up in the spring. Then you have to see the passenger travel come back and then obviously, you have to negotiate with the carriers and see the rates come down. So, I don’t know it’s going to be super quick, but I think that it will come down over the course of the year.
Jim Suva: Great. Thanks so much.
Bob Eulau: Sure.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Jim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Hi. Just a basic one from me. I understand how different nodes on the controller side can help, and some things are out of your control in terms of freight costs, as you just mentioned. But I am just struggling to – with the idea that in a couple of quarters, you feel that some of these supply chain issues will be more manageable. Is there anything else you guys are doing to control your own destiny that makes it sort of a little bit different in terms of your outlook, say, out into September, December? And Bob, congratulations, and I always appreciate working with you. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes. So, I think we are doing everything we can. I mean we are – I mean we always look to diversify our supply chain, especially in this kind of environment. We are staying very close to our suppliers to understand exactly they understand what we need, and we understand what they can provide. Like I said, there has been more variability in that lately. We are redoubling our efforts there to get close to it. And I think when we look – we plan many, many quarters in the future. And so when we look at where we are at, if we can get the surprises out of there, which we think will get better as more of the nodes in the fab start to free up, we will be able to be in a better position. And like I said, there are some big issues. When you roll the portfolio forward, you change the bomb of the product, and that gives you a different set of components that you are using. So, when you look at that planning is what gives us confidence on the second half.
Steven Fox: That’s really helpful. Thank you very much.
Bob Eulau: And thanks, Steve. Appreciate your comments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon guys and appreciate you guys taking the question. And Bob, yes, really enjoyed working with you as well.
Bob Eulau: Thank you.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. I guess my question is sticking with 20 terabytes. Guys, do the component constraints, do those impede the velocity of the ramp through the year? And I believe in the past, you had talked about maybe reaching kind of 20 TB crossover sometime midyear and is that still the case? Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: Yes. The component situation is better on 20, I mean is maybe a better way of saying what I said earlier. But – so I mean, at this point, there is no impeding of that roadmap, right, and that ramp. Where we are running into problems is controllers on 18s because that’s where 75% to 80% of the portfolio is right now, and that’s the sweet spot of what customers are deploying. So, I think as we move through the year and we move into 20, I mean we will get things to free up. We will get closer to our suppliers and get more capacity on the current products as well. But as we move forward, we also have some other dynamics that help us.
Ananda Baruah: That’s super helpful. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just a follow-up to one of the previous questions on, I guess the cost side of things. Obviously, some of the costs are transitory when it comes to supply chain. But it’s no secret that the semiconductor pricing, IC pricing, has gone up, perhaps on a permanent basis. So, I am just curious, Dave, as you kind of talk to your customers, what sort of conversations are you having with your customers? And I am trying to understand your ability to pass through some of these permanent cost increases as we go through the next few quarters.
David Goeckeler: Yes. So, we work – I mean I think this goes back to the conversation we had earlier on multi-quarter agreements. I mean we have been working with our customers quite a bit on what their future looks like and what they are planning. That gives us more certainty in the process. And quite frankly, that’s helped to stabilize pricing in this environment. I mean – the first order of business is to be as close to our customers and mitigate these costs through staying aligned with them. If it gets to the point where there is – we think they are going to be long-term, then of course, well, the economics of the industry will have to reset to drive the continued investment to drive the exabyte growth. So, it’s a little bit of how we are thinking about it right now. It’s – we see them subsiding as the supply chain loosens up and we drive the technology forward. If our calculation is off on that, then we will look at all the other levers we have in the business.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. And Bob, thank you for all your help, and good luck.
Bob Eulau: Thank you. Appreciate it, Srini.
Operator: And our final question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Nik Todorov: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me and thanks for taking the question. We talked about the LTAs on the HDD side. I wonder what is the appetite from customers for doing LTAs on the NAND side, particularly on the enterprise SSD business and maybe on the client SSD side, as supply is obviously impacting?
David Goeckeler: I would say – I mean, definitely LTAs are the routine way the NAND market works with OEMs and anybody that’s buying on a consistent basis. So, that’s been a part of the market for a long time. I think it’s – we are borrowing some of those ideas and moving over to the drive business. Again, I talked about earlier why I am more confident in ‘22 as we walk into the year and as we go forward. On the NAND side, the percentage of the portfolio under LTAs has gone up as well. I mean when we walked into last year, it was over – it was already over half of the portfolio. We walk into this year, it’s more like two-thirds. And realize we have a big percentage of our portfolio in consumer markets in the channel. So, those are not things where you think about multi-quarter agreements with your customers. But in the NAND market, it’s just the way business is done is to negotiate share for different products with customers and then of course, on a quarterly basis, negotiate price within that share envelope. And then there is always the opportunity for upsides beyond that share amount. And we are seeing a fair amount of that right now in the NAND business. There is a lot of customers coming to us PC customers, enterprise SSD customers looking for upside in NAND. So, that – again, that makes us optimistic. When we talk about strong demand signals that’s one of them that gives us confidence in the year. We will manage through the component issues. And we feel super good about where the roadmap is, where the technology that’s underpinning this is. We feel good about the customer relationships and demand signals. And again, to wrap it all up, we spent 1.5 years getting the company in a much stronger financial position. And we look forward to getting back to a shareholder return policy. So – but again, to summarize your question, LTAs, much, much more prevalent in the NAND business.
Nik Todorov: Got it. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Thank you. Alright. Is that it, Peter?
Peter Andrew: Yes.
David Goeckeler: Alright. Thanks. Look, everyone, we really appreciate you joining us today. We will be talking throughout the quarter, and we will look forward to engaging then. Thank you very much.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, everybody.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-10-28 18:25:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew. Thank you. Please go ahead. 
T. Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.
 Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements.
 Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to David for his introductory remarks. 
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results. We reported revenue of $5.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49, all within the guidance ranges we provided in August. This marks the sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding guidance, a point that we are particularly proud of as we continue to navigate uncertainty and volatility in the market.
 Strong demand across diverse end markets, particularly for our cloud products, combined with Western Digital's strong innovation, broad routes to market and sharpened execution enabled us to deliver results within our guidance range despite significant COVID impacts and supply chain disruptions. While these disruptions are transitory, the long-term opportunities for Western Digital remain unchanged as the world's digital transformation continues to accelerate.
 During the quarter, we shipped a record level of exabytes, while also improving non-GAAP gross margins across both flash and HDD and generating profitable growth. We saw strong demand for our latest generation hard drives and flash products in the cloud end market as well as strong consumer demand for new 5G-based mobile phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 flash solutions. The strong demand for these products were partially offset by pressure in the commercial channel within the client end market and certain portions of the consumer end market, particularly retail. This was attributable to component issues impacting our customers' ability to ship products, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.
 Our continued focus on innovation and a more agile business unit structure enabled us to quickly adapt to these dynamics. When combined with an industry-leading portfolio and a strong go-to-market operation, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to continue to generate improved operational performance for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the business trends, I want to highlight a few changes we made to our end market breakdown, which, we believe, will help you understand why Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increasing value and importance of data.
 We now split our end markets into cloud, client and consumer. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital, and we are uniquely positioned to address customer storage needs as the only provider of both hard drive and flash products. During the first quarter, cloud represented a record 44% of total revenue, led by record capacity enterprise hard drive revenue and nearly 30% sequential growth in enterprise SSD revenue.
 We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive growth in this end market and continue to shift our business mix towards the cloud. As we ramp our new innovative products and continue leveraging the benefits of the organization structure we put into place last September, I am confident we will capture opportunities to achieve a more stable and profitable growth profile over the long term.
 The client end market represented 37% of revenue in the first quarter. Here, we are providing a broad array of high-performance flash and hard drive solutions to our OEM and channel customers across PC, mobile, gaming, automotive, VR headsets, at-home entertainment devices and industrial spaces.
 Lastly, the consumer end market accounted for 19% of revenue in the first quarter. The highlight of this end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and the WD_BLACK brand of storage products for gaming enthusiasts, which is strong and growing. The brand recognition and infinity, combined with our unmatched reach with nearly 400,000 points of presence across the world is a great setup for Western Digital as we enter a seasonally stronger part of the year.
 With that, I'll now provide a recap of our HDD and flash businesses as it relates to our first quarter results. In HDD, continued strong demand for our latest generation energy-assisted drives among our cloud and enterprise customers drove record revenue and exabyte shipments in our cloud end market. In addition, we experienced strong revenue growth in our smart video product line, and we're unable to meet demand.
 During the quarter, we announced OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the HDD control plane to further increase aerial density. With this leading architecture, we achieved 20-terabyte capacity using our field-proven 9-disk mechanical platform and ePMR technology. Next month will commence volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology. In flash, revenue grew in the quarter due to continued strong demand within the cloud and client end markets for our latest generation of our enterprise SSD products and the ramp of new 5G phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 node.
 Within enterprise SSD, we experienced continued success in the cloud with another successful quarter of qualifications. We are now qualified at 3 cloud titans and have made excellent progress working our way through the qualification process in the enterprise and distribution channels. We expect these qualifications to start to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2022 as our customers begin to deploy these products into their networks.
 The ramp of next-generation 5G phones incorporating our latest generation of BiCS5 products accelerated in the quarter, with revenue growing over 20% sequentially. We expect this migration to 5G, combined with a continued increase in the amount of storage per phone to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter. Gaming was strong in the quarter with a solid lineup of products for game consoles along with a growing brand recognition of WD_BLACK based products in the channel and retail.
 Heading into the second fiscal quarter, we are well positioned to take advantage of seasonal strength and grow in a wide variety of gaming channels. As I noted earlier, the client PC OEMs' distribution channel and retail were impacted by our customers' ability to ship product, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Demand was solid, but these transitory issues impacted our ability to realize this demand in our results.
 In total, bit growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year in the first quarter as we ramp BiCS5 to 17% of flash revenue. This quarter, we expect year-over-year bit growth to further accelerate to the mid-30s range with BiCS5 bit crossover to happen later in the quarter.
 Our long-term goal is to grow bits in line with the market, taking advantage of our product and end market breadth to shift our bits to optimize profitability. As we look into calendar year 2022, we are optimistic as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. We have industry-leading technology, the right product portfolio and investments and the organizational agility to fundamentally drive improved profitability regardless of market condition.
 We have a great position in 2 large and growing markets in flash and HDD, and we have proven our ability to drive innovation throughout our portfolio and deliver industry-leading products to a broad and loyal customer base. We believe that the migration to the cloud and demand for storage solutions throughout the client and consumer markets will drive a huge opportunity for Western Digital and our customers.
 I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results. 
Robert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance.
 Total revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.49. Please note that EPS included $56 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to deliver such good results in the face of this unanticipated headwind and other supply chain issues.
 From a disclosure perspective, in addition to the change in our end market breakdown that Dave discussed, this quarter, we moved to segment reporting for our flash and hard drive businesses. For more details, please refer to our earnings deck.
 Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 44% of revenue at $2.2 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 72% from a year ago. This represented the second quarter in a row of record revenue. What is encouraging about this cloud revenue growth is the strength and breadth of our revenue streams across product areas. There was growth on a sequential basis in both the flash and hard drive business units as well as across every product category within the cloud, including capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, smart video and platforms. As the cloud continues to grow as a percentage of our revenue, we see an opportunity to reduce volatility in revenue and profitability. Over the last 3 quarters, we have successfully ramped our 18-terabyte energy-assisted drive to our highest volume mainstream product within the cloud end market.
 Overall, cloud HDD exabyte shipments grew 9% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year and comprised over 80% of total HDD exabyte shipments. Client represented 37% of revenue at $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. A highlight within the client end market was growth within our flash business unit, specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IoT and industrial applications. Our strength here was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within our own operations.
 Finally, consumer represented 19% of revenue at $973 million, down 6% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Both our flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to similar supply disruptions in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.
 Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially, primarily due to mix and pricing within our transactional markets. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were flat. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.6 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 4%, while the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $102.
 As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 33.9%, up 1 percentage point sequentially. As noted earlier, this included $56 million in COVID-related costs or a 1.1 percentage point impact. These were highest COVID-related costs in over a year.
 Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our flash gross margin by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 37%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.9%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $51 million or approximately 2 percentage points.
 Operating expenses were $761 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $952 million, representing a 15% increase from the prior quarter and tripling year-over-year, highlighting our profitable growth. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 11%.
 Earnings per share was $2.49, toward the top of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $521 million, and free cash flow was $224 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $297 million. We continue to expect gross CapEx for this fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion.
 In the fiscal first quarter, we paid off $213 million in debt, including a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.6 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, as a result of our strong financial results and free cash flow generation, last week, we repaid the remaining balance of our term Loan B in the amount of $943 million, bringing total gross debt outstanding to $7.7 billion.
 Our adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.2 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.0x, down from 2.7 a year ago and was the lowest in 3 years. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.
 Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and we expect flash revenue to increase sequentially and hard drive revenue to decline sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the second quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.95 and $2.25 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 316 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
 I'll now turn the call back over to Dave. 
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. I want to conclude by thanking the Western Digital team for their hard work and commitment to our customers throughout a challenging quarter. Despite the transitory issues we have been able to successfully navigate, it is clearer than ever Western Digital's innovative technology portfolio is foundational to the rapid digital transformation and transition to the cloud that the world is experiencing. With our deep roots in a broad range of end markets and a sharp focus on execution, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to capture this massive opportunity, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the fiscal year.
 Let's now begin the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
David Goeckeler: Hey, Aaron? 
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Sorry guys. Can you hear me? 
Robert Eulau: No problem. We hear you. 
Aaron Rakers: Sorry about that. Yes, so I've got 2 quick questions, if I can. I guess, first of all, it seems like there's a lot of moving parts in the quarter and more importantly, into the guidance outlook for fiscal 2Q. Bob, I'm just wondering if you can help quantify to your best estimate of how much impact you're carrying in revenue expectations relative to some of these "transitory effect"? 
Robert Eulau: Yes, it's difficult to quantify, right, because there's impact in terms of our own execution, which, I think, we worked our way through pretty well during the quarter. And then we have customers who have supply chain challenges as well where they're trying to get match sets and build out their environments. And then, of course, we have supplier challenges as well, where we're working like everybody else, pretty hard to get components in. So it's difficult to give you a definitive answer in terms of what the impact was in the quarter, we just closed or even obviously, in the next quarter. But it's certainly somewhere in the couple of hundred million dollar range and potentially a little worse in the December quarter. 
David Goeckeler: Aaron, this is Dave. First of all, thanks for the question. I guess the one thing I would say as well is, whereas maybe a quarter or 2 ago, we were seeing it in maybe certain parts of the business, some of the OEMs, PC OEMs. Now we're seeing it more broadly, even the big data center players are having their demand impact. Our demand from them is being impacted by their ability to get other components. So it's really become a much more broad-based issue across the portfolio. 
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then if I can follow up real quickly, one of the things that stands out to me is that I think you reported a blended ASP decline of about 3% sequential in the flash business. So I believe the mix of enterprise actually went up to the positive. So when I look at that ASP erosion relative to actually some of your peers in the NAND market, it seems to be a bit of a disconnect. Can you help me understand the pricing dynamics you're seeing in NAND right now? 
Robert Eulau: Yes, I can start, and then Dave can fill in. Yes, I mean, the blended ASP, as we started the quarter, we indicated we expected it to be down. And it was based on the mix we were anticipating. The mix came in essentially the way we had expected. And it was -- I don't want to get into every little detail of the mix. But one of the things we said at the beginning of the quarter was we expected more mobile volume in the September quarter, and that is what we saw. We actually think we'll see even more mobile as a percentage of the total in the December quarter. So mix is definitely a bit of a headwind for us. But really, ASPs are not going down that much. And we're really pleased with the cost reductions we've been able to achieve both in the quarter we just finished as well as what we're expecting to do this quarter. 
David Goeckeler: Yes, I guess, Aaron, Bob right on the money on that. I guess the only thing I would add is a little bit of softness in some of the transactional and consumer markets, but that we're already seeing that level out a little bit. And we're really seeing this bifurcation where the qualified bits in the market are strong and unqualified are a little bit weaker. I guess that's not surprising given all the nodal transitions the industry is going through. But the primary issue, I would say that's the issue in mix, as Bob pointed out. And we expected that walking into the quarter. 
Operator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess if I look at your revenue guide and kind of the commentary on NAND bits, it sounds like the implied HDD revenue guide is roughly down 15% sequentially. So I guess, A, is the math right there? And B, I guess, what's causing the severity of decline? Can you kind of help us understand what's digestion versus some of the transitory supply chain issues that you spoke to? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think that's probably a little -- we don't guide each individual business, but I think your number is probably a little heavy. You hit on some of the issues. Some of it is mix. We've actually got one of our very, very big customers that has their own supply chain issues that's pushing out some orders. So that's a bit of an idiosyncratic thing that's happening there. There's some supply chain issues with, especially in kind of mid-cap and the ability to build all of that supply we want. We talked about that even in this past quarter in the smart video market, which is strong and there's some unmet demand there.
 And then we've got -- we're seeing a little bit of an inventory issue, quite frankly, in China, where there's a lot of high-cap inventory there, and that's kind of pulling the number down a little bit for the next quarter. But we -- so we expect all those things are transitory issues. We're really happy about the portfolio. I think the fact that AT&T was now -- the majority of the portfolio, we talked about shipping 20-t on a 9-disk platform and OptiNAND is out there and in customers' hands. So we feel really good about the innovation that was delivered in the quarter and about where the road map is going in the drive business and the new technology has been very well received. 
Christopher Muse: That's great. And I guess as my follow-up, Bob, could you speak to how we should be thinking about gross margins into the first half of '22? Obviously, there's certain unknowns in terms of revenues and NAND pricing. But would love to hear perhaps some of the other puts and takes that we should be thinking about as well as the timing of when you think some of the COVID-related costs may abate? 
Robert Eulau: Yes, C.J., you're right. It's difficult to say exactly what's going to happen over the next few quarters. But -- and as you know, we only give guidance 1 quarter at a time. Now having said that, we're pretty optimistic on 2022. Again, we think a lot of the challenges in the quarter we closed, in the quarter we're in now are really supply chain related. We think the underlying demand situation is very positive. We really believe, as I said in our cost reduction plans, and we think we'll be able to deliver solid margins. So I don't want to get into giving guidance for next year, but we're definitely optimistic. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: I wonder if you could update us on where you are with BiCS5 qualification? I assume saying you'll be mobile heavy this quarter. It means you're kind of still getting qualified across the SSD markets? And I had a follow-up. 
David Goeckeler: Yes, I think that's right. I mean it's early in the node. We are happy with the ramp this quarter. We ended at, I think, 17% BiCS5, and we expect to get crossover before we exit the year. But like any new node, you're in more of the mobile components market as the rest of the products get qualified, but that's all work underway. And our customers are definitely pulling us in that direction. They want BiCS5 on the SSD products and the engineers are hard at work at getting that work done. That will be an evolving story as we work through '22. 
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. And then I think you referenced some of the segments in client SSD maybe being a little weaker. Can you separate out? Is there a Chi effect there where it was good for a while and then it was less good versus just overall client SSD being oversupplied because of other issues in the supply chain. Like how do you sort that out? And what do you see happening in the client SSD market? 
David Goeckeler: I don't think we see it as a Chi effect. I mean, I was just talking to our sales team this morning, and I think the channel has now kind of normalized and back on seasonality after the Chi disruption. I think we just see this issue with people not able to get all the components they need to put together the full kit for what they want to ship, and that's causing some softness in the channel. So I think it's more related to that than it is anything Chi related, at least in my view. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. 
Karl Ackerman: Bob, earlier in a response to a question, you had indicated some of the impact or challenge in your enterprise, I believe, HDD business and SSD business was a result of a push out by a customer. My question there is if we isolate that customer, how do you see the demand trajectory of cloud in mass capacity markets not just into the December quarter, but also into the second half of your fiscal year? Certainly, as you begin to ramp some of these 20 terabyte drives and other higher capacity drives in HDDs as well as some of these new design wins you have in enterprise SSD. 
Robert Eulau: Do you want me to take that or you? 
David Goeckeler: I can start. 
Robert Eulau: Okay. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. So I think as a general statement, we're seeing continued very strong demand from our data center customers, especially we've very big data center customers. They're giving us good signals about next year and what they plan to do. It's hard to pin that down to a certain quarter right now, but we continue to see very strong demand there. Like I said, we're starting to see the supply chain impact show up there as well. But I'm sure that will all get worked through as we go through the year. But we look into '22, and we have our customers telling us, it continues to be a strong demand environment. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I don't think I have anything to add. I mean we believe in the cloud demand. I think it's strong, and there just is a lot of supply chain dislocation right now. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. 
Unknown Executive: This is actually [ John ] on behalf of Wamsi. Just curious, there has been a lot of media focus on Kioxia. And in the past, Western Digital has expressed interest in the asset. Do you think that consolidation still make sense? And do you still have an appetite for it? 
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean I think I'll speak in general about Kioxia. They're a tremendous JV partner. And we've spoken a lot about the JV and what the benefits of that are. And all the -- I think one of the highlights of the quarter is the continued production of the flash road map and BiCS5 and the cost situation that, that's driving. I mean I think it's always been a very big focus of the Western Digital and Kioxia team to very focus on capital efficiency and cost downs in the portfolio. Those -- the seeds for BiCS5 performance that we're seeing now were shown many years ago. That continues to be a great focus of the joint teams. And I think the fact that we have a joint road map with another supplier as big as Kioxia gives us a lot of investment in our road map.
 And then, of course, we produce together as well and have a lot of synergies there as well. So it's a great partnership. We -- it's been going for over 20 years now. It's going to go for -- we're signed up for at least another decade. And we always look at that as we continue to invest in fabs, and we're really happy with the partnership, and we're going to continue to get the best out of it. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Two questions. The first one is for the team. Obviously, there is a long lead time associated with the equipment procurement. So at this point, I would think that you have a pretty good feel for a bit, NAND, bit supply growth in calendar year '22. Is there any color you can share with us? And I have a follow-up. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean we do have good visibility, and you saw our bit growth came back up again this quarter. We expect it to be a bit higher year-over-year next quarter. Our long-term goal continues to be to grow at the rate the market is growing, and we won't get that perfectly every quarter, but that's our objective. And we think that, again, with Kioxia, we've got the right plans in place for next year. 
Mehdi Hosseini: But what is the target for next year, calendar year? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I don't think we put a specific number out there yet. Some of the industry analysts suggesting industry demand growth in the low 30% range. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And given the fact that your enterprise and cloud customers are expressing a good solid demand in calendar year '22. Have you determined how to allocate, and perhaps I'm trying to better understand how you're thinking about the mix between cloud enterprise and client and consumer. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think we're certainly having those discussions with them. I mean, I think every quarter, we discussed the current quarter and out many quarters -- several quarters in advance at least, I mean, we don't lock in per se on those numbers exactly, but we think about share of their particular businesses and what that's going to look like and what that means to demand for us. So yes, we're having those conversations, and we're factoring them into the mix of bits for next year and how we allocate across the portfolio. Of course, there's a nodal mix equation of that as well as it's kind of referred to in the previous question, when are different products available on different nodes out of the fab. So we're working through all that right now. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: I want to go back to the HDD guidance and just maybe ask around what the normalized base of revenue is. I mean, obviously, your peer guided flat, you're down kind of like low teens. It sounds like something in the range of $2.25 billion in that range. It sounds like part of that is a push out and some of that some company-specific issues on the supply side. So can you help us bridge the gap there? Is it -- is 2.6% kind of flat like the normalized level if you adjust for all that? Or is it something that's slightly down Q-on-Q, but not down low teens? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean, again, it's hard to quantify exactly what the supply chain impacts were, and we're actually not giving guidance by segment, but we definitely believe the hard drive business is a growth business and it will continue to grow over the next few quarters. We think 2022 will be a strong year. And yes, this is a bit of an aberration in the December quarter, but it's -- the business is really solid. The underlying demand is very good. And you're right. I mean we already commented that there are some supply chain issues that are impacting us right now. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: Dave, I wanted to ask about enterprise SSDs. You talked about now being qualified 3 cloud titans, which is great. You also talked about some of these wins translating into revenue growth and potentially driving an acceleration and growth in '22. Can you help us kind of shape the ramp into '22? Could it be more first half weighted, second half weighted? I know these projects can move around a little bit. But any help there would be really, really helpful. And then related to that, the impact on profitability as you ramp that business, initially, would it be a headwind and then eventually a tailwind? Or should it be fairly margin neutral from the get-go? 
David Goeckeler: Toshi Hari, so first of all, yes, we are really happy with the progress of the portfolio. I remember sitting here a year ago, and we were just trying to get over the hump on the first one, and now we're over 3 of them, and we continue to work at the OEMs, which the enterprise OEMs, which tend to be longer call cycles, and we're making good progress there as well. And you're right. We'll -- we got the calls done. We'll start to see some -- a little bit of deployment next quarter and then start to ramp it throughout '22. So I think it's an evolving story as we go throughout the year. From what is -- I think it's a very attractive TAM. I think with good margins, and that's why we're investing in the products. And I think as we mix more into that and have more supply into that, it's a tailwind for the overall portfolio. That's definitely a true statement. 
Operator: Your next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Yes, I guess my question would be for whatever it is that you guys consider to be the revenue impact to the December quarter guide, could you just sort of anecdotally map out for us, how much is from the flash business relative to HDD? And then inside of HDD, how much would be from the impact of kind of the cloud type. It sounds like there's some component stuff on their side there? And then you had mentioned some channel dynamics and some WD dynamics as well on the PC business. That would be helpful. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean this is -- I'm trying to think how to answer this question differently. I mean we're actually not giving guidance by segment. However, we did say we expect revenue to be down a bit on the hard drive side. We expect it to be up sequentially on the flash side. There are supply chain challenges in -- with some cloud customers. There are supply chain challenges with some PC OEMs. We also mentioned that there seems to be a fair amount of inventory in China right now. So there's -- there definitely are some short-term challenges with respect to the hard drive business. But again, long term, the underlying growth is really good there. 
Operator: Your next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. 
Vijay Rakesh: Just had a couple of quick questions. On the client SSD side, as you look at next year, just wondering how you're thinking, what the outlook was. I know server looks pretty strong for next year. But on the client SSD side and on mobile too, how you are looking at next year's demand? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. We think the PC TAM is good next year. I mean we're obviously coming off of a blockbuster year with COVID. I mean we see the pre-COVID baseline is around 265 million, 270 million units. That went up to 340 million this year expected around that number, and we see somewhere around 320 million to 335 million next year. So definitely been -- we're going to come off this year a little bit. But we're -- we see basically the baseline has been reset, pre-COVID by a significant amount. So we feel good about that. We're hearing that from our customers. We're talking to those customers now about 2022 plans and what they plan to do and how much supply they're going to need and share conversations with each of them and those conversations are going well.
 The smartphone market, again, we continue to see this past quarter and the quarter in, we're seeing really good strength in that market. So I think this is -- there's a larger point here about the flash market is that the number of end markets is just more diverse now, especially with enterprise SSD growing and getting to be such a big market that there's a much better mix of demand that we play across in the market. And so we see strength in PC. We see strength in smartphones. We see strength in data center.
 Like we said, the more transactional markets this past quarter is more nodal transitions going on. There was more bits available in those markets, and we definitely saw that. But again, we're heading into a seasonally strong quarter on retail. So as we go through the quarter, we'll get a very strong idea about how retail is going to play out as well as we go through the holiday season. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: Relates to hard drive business, earlier, you talked about inventory issues in China. Can you add a little color to that? How much are -- how much excess inventory are there? Do you think that will get back to normalized levels exiting the year? And any other geography you're watching out right now? 
David Goeckeler: That's the main geography we're watching, and it's mainly high capacity, and we think it will get worked through in the next quarter. But it's definitely in the channel and it's some of the big customers. So it's just something that's going to impact the amount of business that goes -- that flows through that part of the market, which is a pretty big market for all of us, but we don't see it more than a quarter, maybe a little bit more of impact. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: Bob, on the prepared remarks, you talked about the different variables in terms of the supply chain shrink and the suppliers, your own manufacturing efficiencies as well as the customers. Can you for both September and December give kind of a qualitative commentary on which were the biggest impacts in both September and December? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I think what I said earlier is we're actually expecting December to be a little more challenging than what we saw in September and the September quarter was not easy. And starting with our own teams, I think we did a really good job given what was going on with COVID in Southeast Asia. We did mention our COVID costs were up to $56 million this quarter. And we've done a really excellent job in terms of working with local governments to try and get as many employees vaccinated as possible and to really do the best we can to assure supply in terms of our own factories.
 Now as we mentioned, like everyone else, we have challenges in terms of getting components as well, particularly, obviously, the controllers on both the hard drive and the flash side, and that has an impact on the business. I don't know quarter-to-quarter, which quarter is worse, but it's a challenge in both of them. And it's a challenge that's not going to go away soon in terms of the semiconductor availability. I mean we're getting some lead times of 50 weeks right now. So it's definitely a very real issue in terms of getting components in.
 And then we've already talked a fair amount about the customer challenges. And I would say it feels to me and Dave can comment like there are more customers impacted by the supply chain in the December quarter than there were in the September quarter. It seems a little more broad-based. 
David Goeckeler: Yes, I don't think there's any doubt about that. I think when we talk to our sales teams and we talk to our customers, I mean it's -- I think just over the last month or so, the number of places where we're hearing, they are not able to meet their own true demand or they can't pull the demand from us if they're building their own infrastructure because the supply chain components has definitely broadened. And it's -- I think it started in some of the PC makers. I think that's where we heard the most about it, if you go back a couple of quarters. And now, like I said, we're hearing more about it in other segments, including the big data center providers. So it's definitely an impact of the business, and we just navigate through it.
 I mean, I think when you talk to our customers and we talk to our own sales teams and we look at what everybody is telling us, the end demand continues to be very, very strong. And everybody is just trying to figure out how to meet that and how to get enough components and get the right components to build the right kit, whether it's for something they're going to sell or it's building their own infrastructure to build what they need. And as Bob said, we see that ourselves. And our ability to get components and our ability to make sure our factories continue to run. And I will say I'll be a little bit selfish here and complement our own teams. But the Delta variant in Asia was a very big impact. And this quarter was probably one of the most difficult since COVID started. There were points where we had thousands of employees in quarantine and still kept everything going. So when you see what's happening on the ground and what the impact has been, it's not hard to understand how all the discussions around supply chain impacts.
 I think the good news is that we're working very, very hard, as Bob said, with governments to get vaccines distributed and get things back on track. And as we exit the quarter, and we sit here today, things were in a much, much better shape than they were a couple of months ago. So it makes us optimistic as we go through 2022 that this will get worked out and that will all be able to meet the true demand that's out there. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: So on your client business, you guys talked about the PC market being weak in September due to supply disruptions at customers. We all know about the match set challenges on component shortages, that's been pretty well telegraphed. But you also mentioned the WD sort of specific supply chain disruptions on client HDD as well. Is the primary impact the shortage of HDD controllers and preamps or is the primary impact on the COVID-19 related sort of operations disruptions? And given your semiconductor suppliers' lead times, when do you expect to see your client HDD specific chip supply issues start to ease? 
David Goeckeler: I'll take a crack and then Bob can add some color as well. I mean it depends on how you look at it. I mean, certainly, our COVID costs are up significantly this quarter. I think nearly 50% or more, 60% on what they were last quarter. We had been steady state for probably 3, 4 quarters in a row, and now we've bumped up significantly. So a lot of that is cost going into managing our own infrastructure and work that's going on with our own teams. Of course, a lot of it is logistics as well. That's always a big component of it. So those costs are going up.
 Our own supply is mainly around controllers. I think it's fair to say. And as Bob said, we're planning a year out on lead times and working with our own suppliers on how we, number one, make sure we get everything we need to meet our demand, which has been challenging and then get it in a time frame that we need. But we're working through it. And like I said, I think that there's no doubt, if you go back a couple of quarters, we've been talking about this about how we were not able to meet all the demand that we saw out there. I think the thing that we see different walking into this quarter is there's -- we're seeing even a greater impact across all of our customer base, and it's spreading to places where we hadn't seen it before. And that's both raising the uncertainty and also just depressing the demand because customers can't get all the pieces they need, so they don't need everything from us.
 So we're starting to see some hints in some markets, starting to clear up a little bit, super early days. But again, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Asia, things are getting better, at least from our perspective, our narrow perspective, although we have 40,000, 50,000 people there. Things are getting better on the ground and that gives us optimism that the situation will improve from here as we go through '22. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. 
Thomas O'Malley: I had another one on the HDD business. You guys have done a really good job of improving profitability over the last year plus. My question is, as related to supply issues, clearly, there's a revenue headwind here. Could you talk about the impact to gross margins? Do you expect that you see a greater impact there because of the supply issues? Or is this more of a revenue issue with gross margins kind of hanging in? Any help there would be nice. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. Let me start and then turn it over to Bob. I mean I think there are some headwinds. I mean one of them would be a little bit of mix because at least for a 1 quarter impact because we've got such a big customer pushing out some demand. And then you've got pricing going up on components. So you've got inflation in the supply chain is a bit of a headwind as well.
 All that said, we appreciate your comments. The team has worked extremely hard. We've rolled out a lot of innovation in the drive business and driven the gross margins. 30.9% this quarter, we thought was a great result. And on top of that, we had couple of points of COVID headwind on top of it. So it all starts with making sure we deliver a great product to our customers. It starts with innovation. You guys have heard me say this many, many times, and I think the innovation engine is alive and well.
 Another big step forward this quarter with OptiNAND. And I think as the team continues to drive innovation and we drive great products to our customers, we'll have the opportunity to continue to have a better conversation with our customers around profitability. All that said, there are some headwinds, I would say, in the near term. 
Robert Eulau: Yes, there are definitely headwinds. But like you said, the team has done a great job in terms of the product portfolio, and we think the gross margins will be down a little. We are going to have probably COVID costs in the same ballpark as we have this quarter. So that's a couple of points. But I think we've got a really good chance of having gross margins above 30%, again, on the hard drive business. 
Operator: Your next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. 
Jim Suva: I just have one question, and it sounds like the December outlook is truly in aberration. So the people will push back and say, well, why is it truly an aberration and not simply the new norm. So maybe if you can walk us through around why December is so unique because whether it'd be supply chain or shipping costs, they look quite prolonged. So if you could just kind of lay out the reasons about why December is so unique for such aberration? 
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean, first of all, we're in a very unique time and we're still. I think as we talked about the supply chain disruptions that have been brought by COVID and especially the Delta variant that really pushed through Asia over the last quarter or more have been very, very significant and very severe. And to the people that were managing the situation on the ground there, they did a tremendous job, they had an enormous amount of work just to keep everything running.
 So I think that just leads to a very unique environment, Jim, that we're navigating through. Like I said, when we look at demand and we look at what our customers are telling us about demand in the market, we hear very good things. We -- they're very positive and very bullish. We just have -- you just have different customers in different states of their own ability to build what they need to build or want to build and that's constantly shifting. And when you add it all up in any particular quarter, you're going to get a result and that's what we got, and that's what we'll manage to. But we think that as the supply chain issues get worked out, the demand trends in the business are very, very strong, and we're on the right side of where the world is going from a technology point of view.
 Now I thought it was significant this quarter to 44%, record percent of our quarter was in the cloud. And hopefully, you guys react positively to our simpler decomposition of our revenue across cloud, client and consumer, but we expect to see more growth in cloud, 72% year-over-year growth in that part of the business, and we continue to have the portfolio pivoting in that direction and expect it to be -- expect to participate in that growth as it goes forward. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. 
Steven Fox: So I guess I'm just trying to understand the idea that none of the demand pushouts are perishable because this is the seasonally strongest quarter of the year. How do we have confidence around that maybe not necessarily that it's perishable, but maybe spending that would have occurred in December, it doesn't occur in March, even if there's availability just because of timing around -- usual timing around spending? 
David Goeckeler: Well, again, I think it goes back to -- if you're talking to a very large cloud provider that's trying to build out their infrastructure, I think they're going to catch up on building it out to what their demand is. If they can't do it this quarter, they'll get the components in the next quarter. So again, we see very good demand environment. And I think that as our customers are able to get all the components they need, they will continue to come back to us and adjust their demand to us. That's what we see. We have very close relationships with them. And so I don't expect that the demand from our customers' point of view is not like kind of a 1-quarter thing. It's like -- it's just -- it's a demand curve that goes on, and I don't see it as being perishable demand. I see it as everybody is trying to figure out how they can get as many components as they can to build complete kits for what they need to do. And as they do that, they come back to us and change their demand signal. And we've seen that.
 Maybe a good example is on some of the PC manufacturers, where 1 quarter, they'll drop their demand significantly. In the next quarter, they'll come back and raise it significantly when they've got their own supply chain issues worked out. So as I said, we've seen this in other parts of the market, and we've dealt with it, and we know how to deal with it. Now we're just seeing it across -- the broader cross-section of our business. And quite frankly, some really big customers across that are in that mix now. And we'll -- we've been working through this now for the last several quarters, and we'll work through it this quarter. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. And the most seasonal business is the consumer business, and we are expecting to have a sequential increase in the consumer business. So I think that's probably where it might be perishable demand. But we think that will be pretty solid this quarter. 
Operator: And today's final question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. 
Srinivas Pajjuri: Dave, I had a question about your pricing strategy going forward, especially given the cost inflation we are seeing in the supply chain. I guess some of the cost increases are temporary and some may be permanent. I'm just curious as to hear your thoughts in your conversations with your customers, what kind of feedback you're getting as you kind of look to pass through some of these costs to your customers? And also I want to hear about your -- what you think your ability is in terms of passing through some of these incremental costs if these costs continue to, I guess, remain permanent? 
David Goeckeler: I think you hit on the answer in your first part of your question set up, which is these are broad and long relationships with our customers, and they don't go up and down quite so fast. So we certainly have conversations with our customers when our costs increase, but it's not as simple as just passing it along. It's got to persist for a while before we would have that conversation. And quite frankly, we participate in a market. It's -- and so it's more about the market price. I think the overwhelming issue with pricing is around innovation, and making sure we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio.
 And as I look back on last quarter, the 2 things that -- 2 really big things that stand out to me from last quarter is, one, is just the execution of the team in a really, really difficult environment, especially the -- as I've talked a lot about the factories in Asia; and two is the innovation road map and the fact we're transitioning aggressively to BiCS5. We introduced OptiNAND. Those are the things. We introduced a 20-terabyte drive and are going to be shipping that in volume now here in the next month. That's with our energy assist technology 9-platter, 9 disk drive, 2.2 terabytes per platter. So that's the primary issue where it's going to drive an innovation-led discussion with our customers about pricing.
 In the cost side of it, of course, as if they're going to be very long term, we're going to have those conversations. But I would say they're long and substantial relationships, and we manage through the quarter-to-quarter stuff with them really in both directions. But really, the focus is on that -- on driving innovation. If you drive innovation, you're going to get a better return for it. And quite frankly, I think we've seen that over the last 3 or 4 quarters as we brought energy assist in our 18-terabyte drive, the 30.9% gross margin this quarter in HDD is a multiyear high. So we feel very good about that. 
Operator: And speakers, that was our final question. I'll turn it over to you for any closing remarks. 
David Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We really appreciate it. It's always good to talk to everyone. Thank you for all your questions, and we look forward to talking to all of you throughout the quarter. Take care. 
Robert Eulau: Thanks, everyone. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-08-04 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 Analyst Call. Personally all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will open the lines up for questions shortly.  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for his introductory comments.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We reported solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16, all above the guidance ranges we provided in April. The upside was primarily driven by record demand for our capacity enterprise hard drives. Fiscal year 2021 revenue totaled $16.9 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $04.55. Last March I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and every person's day-to-day life. At that time, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Today the accelerated digital transformation that has occurred during this period has created a world that is more technology enabled and technology dependent than ever before. The increasing value and importance of data is undeniable and Western Digital will continue to capitalize on this opportunity as the only provider of both flash and hard drive solutions. Our ability to provide this diverse range of technologies enables us to drive innovation from endpoints to the edge to the cloud and combined with our commitment to delivering the highest quality products, is ultimately what sets us apart and allows us to deliver strong results. As we reflect on this fiscal year, I'm very proud of what Western Digital has accomplished, particularly in light of the fact that the pandemic impacted various aspects of our company and the supply chain. As a team we made the changes throughout the year necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution, and layout the right strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. To achieve these goals we created separate business units for our flash and HDD technologies, led by two widely respected technology leaders. As a result of this renewed focus, we accelerated our innovation roadmap, built momentum in our energy-assisted hard drives and continue to successfully ramp our second generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, while working hard to complete additional customer qualifications. We were also able to successfully navigate through the pandemic and capitalize on opportunities and continue providing dependable industry-leading products that are the cornerstones of the data economy. We continue to believe that we have the right foundation for success, the right market-leading products, the right customer base and the unique ability to address two large and growing markets. That foundation continues to underpin the strength of our results and is propelling the business forward today, even as we manage through some of the lingering impacts from COVID. And while we saw incremental demand due to the emergence of Chia, our standout performance this quarter was primarily attributable to increasing demand from our cloud customers and the beginning of a recovery in enterprise demand. The breadth and quality of our product line and our many routes to market, we feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses as it relates to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter demand for our flash products was greater than we could supply in a number of end markets. In the face of both component and NAND shortages, we continue to strategically shift bits to meet customer needs while driving growth in both revenue and gross margin. Within data center devices and solutions demand for our NVMe enterprise SSDs came in above our expectations, achieving strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, we are pleased with our progress in enterprise SSDs as we completed the qualification of another cloud Titan and are ramping the product more broadly. Within client SSD we experienced revenue growth as demand remained strong for notebooks and Chromebooks. This remains a large growing an important end market for Western Digital across our OEM channel and retail routes to market. Within gaming, demand from the latest generation of game consoles, and our WD Black product line was robust as gamers continued to prefer our expanding lineup of customized solutions. Within embedded flash, we also experienced growth in smart home devices, VR, automotive and industrial. As the BiCS5 ramp picks up and we achieve bit crossover late this year, we expect to see increased bit growth. To-date BiCS5 is our most capital efficient node in the 3D era and the ramp across our product lines will contribute to profitable growth. We have had incredible success with BiCS4 from across cost and bit growth perspective and look forward to experience those same benefits with BiCS5 highlighting once again the successful and important partnership we have with Kioxia. In HDD we had our highest organic sequential revenue growth in the last decade, driven by the successful ramp of our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drive, growing cloud demand, a recovery in enterprise spending, and to a lesser extent crypto currency driven by Chia. This impressive performance is a reflection of our data center customers confidence in our innovation engine for capacity enterprise hard drives. Shipments for our 18teribyte hard drive nearly tripled sequentially, highlighting our leadership in the latest capacity point and the leading edge energy-assist technology underpinning it. These drives are fully commercialized we expect the 18 terabyte hard drive to be the workhorse for the fiscal year. I'm excited to announce a record shipment of over 104 exabytes in capacity enterprise hard drives, a 49% increase sequentially. This is a significant achievement for the business as we have all of our largest customers qualified and are well into ramping our energy-assisted hard drives. In addition, client demand for desktop and smart video has been strong throughout the quarter due to improving OEM demand. While we are actively managing supply constraints, we expect strength in OEM to continue in the fiscal first quarter. Within retail HDD demand was above expectations as we saw consumer interest grow for both at home HDD storage and for smart video applications. There was also increased demand for hard drives due to Proof-of-space crypto currencies such as Chia, which emerged as a new vertical market at the beginning of the quarter. We believe Proof-of-space crypto currency presents a great opportunity for us in the industry, but we are closely monitoring the sustainability of demand. Looking ahead, we strongly believe the fundamental technology shift that I referenced earlier is a sustainable trend. At the center of this innovation are ever-increasing intelligent devices which are fueling exponential industry-wide growth in demand, all powered by the cloud. The ability to harness the data in both the device and in the data center is critical, highlighting the importance of our full range of storage solutions. Moreover, we believe we have the right portfolio to enable us to capture these opportunities. In particular, and as Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy discussed in a webcast on July 15, Western Digital's unique ability to deliver both HDD and flash solutions drives meaningful synergies across the business in four key areas; market, manufacturing, technology and customer. And our new operating structure gives us the focus we need to capture our full potential. While we remain optimistic, there are several factors we are closely monitoring. Most importantly, we are actively managing the continued impact of the pandemic. The disruptions to the supply chain have presented a challenge across the industry and we continue to see shortages of certain components. Additionally, logistics remain a challenge as different geographies are in various stages of reopening. This has been a major contributor to increase lead times and may pose challenges in the future. As a result of the supply disruptions, logistics challenges and increased lead times, we continue to face additional cost pressures. Despite these obstacles, we are working diligently to continue delivering to our customers while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. I'll now turn the call over to Bob, to share details on our financial results.
Robert Eulau: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in April. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up 19% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.16. For the full fiscal year revenue was $16.9 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2020 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.55, up 50% from last year. Looking at our end markets, Client Devices revenue was $2.2 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we experienced revenue growth in both hard drives and flash and across every major product category; client HDDs, client SSDs, automotive, gaming, smart video and industrial. Mobile revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 44% sequentially and up 6% from a year ago. New product ramps in this end market drove more than double the revenue growth from just two quarters ago. Revenue generated from our latest generation energy-assisted hard drives and enterprises SSDs contributed to the growth. Our capacity enterprise hard drives grew 49% sequentially and our enterprise SSDs grew 39% sequentially. Demand for our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drives was particularly strong, comprising nearly half of our capacity enterprise exabytes shipments. Finally, Client Solutions revenue was $977 million, up 10% sequentially and up 42% from a year ago. Once again revenue growth was broad based across both HDD and flash and all major product categories. Turning to revenue by technology, flash revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 7% sequentially on a blended basis and up 4% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 4% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 34%, while the average price per hard drive increased 18% to $97. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up 5.2 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in April. Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively ship bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our gross margin by 5.5 percentage points sequentially to 35.5%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.3% up 5.3 percentage points sequentially. This also includes a COVID-related impact of $32 million or approximately $1.3 percentage points. Operating expenses were $790 million within our guidance range. Operating income was $828 million representing 101% increase from the prior quarter and a 57% increase year-over-year. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 9.2% and the tax rate was 13.4% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $2.16. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $994 million and free cash flow was $792 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was an outflow of $202 million. We expect growth CapEx for the next fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion. In the fiscal fourth quarter we paid off $212 million in debt, including a discretionary debt payment of $150 million. For the full fiscal year we paid down a total of $886 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.8 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. Additionally, we have already made a discretionary debt payment of $150 million in the fiscal first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement was $3.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.4 times compared to 2.8 a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the investor relations website for further details. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have unused revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Moving on to our outlook, our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows; we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 33% and 35%. We expect hard drive gross margin to be relatively flat and we expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially. We expect operating expenses to be between $755 million and $785 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 12% in the fiscal first quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to between $2.25 and $2.55 in the first quarter assuming approximately $317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I’ll now turn the call back over to Dave.
David Goeckeler: Thanks Bob. As we close out fiscal year 2021, I am very pleased with how the Western Digital team successfully navigated dynamic market conditions brought on by the pandemic. While it has been a challenging time for all, we will continue to focus on driving innovation. When you combine the ramp of new innovation products into two very large and growing markets with our newly adapted organization structure, I am confident that our increased focus on execution will continue to propel us forward as the market leaders. Our diverse technology portfolio is the foundation of the data economy and our unique ability to see the entire storage market enables us to move across the technology landscape to meet customers' needs and be the solution for their evolving storage challenges. With careful consideration of the health and safety of our employees, we are also keeping a close eye on the status of COVID-19. In particular, there are certain parts of Asia seeing a spike in cases and we are working diligently to support our employees through this time. While it is a difficult situation, we will continue to navigate the complexities presented by the pandemic while we drive innovation for customers and value for shareholders. Let’s begin the Q&A session.
Operator:  We have a question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the tightness in NAND that you referenced, to what degree is that a NAND issue versus controllers and kind of other components trickle  into NAND products?
David Goeckeler: Hey Joe, good to hear from you. So, it's both. There’s no doubt there is shortage in controllers and I think what we are doing is mixing the portfolio to get the most out of the controllers we have, also a shortage of NAND as well. So I mean, we're mixing to get the best result we can, but there’s more demand than we are able to satisfy on the NAND side. So, it’s really, we are juggling both and balancing them to get the best result we can.
Joseph Moore: Okay and as, you guide for the September quarter is the assumption that you’re still kind of supply constrained for the whole quarter?
David Goeckeler: Yes, we are still juggling both of those things. Right? We have customers looking for upside, we are juggling that. Mixes is a little different from quarter to quarter as well. So yes, when you roll all that together is how you to get -- get to where we are at in Q1.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Sure thing.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations from the solid results. I want to ask about the hard disc drives, the 49% sequential growth in your year line capacity shift and I’m curious that, how are you thinking about the sustainability of that demand? I think last quarter you talked a little bit about longer term purchase agreement, and then if you can underneath of that also any thoughts of how significant Chia was as far as a contribution this last quarter? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, thanks, Aaron. So we did see very, very strong demand from the cloud and I think the product has been very well received. As we've talked about energy-assist is fully commercialized now. We saw very strong sequential growth of the AT&T product. We continue to see strong growth in the second half, working with our customers. We expect continued growth in the business. The long-term agreements, I think we're, I think, probably the best way to think about that as we're working through the first cohort of those and we expect to talk about the second cohort in the second half, and they're becoming more and more important, because getting visibility and the demand is very important, especially going forward is where we're thinking about how to invest in additional head capacity to support the growth of the business, just the exabyte growth. Chia was, maybe one way to think about that, it was hitting us kind of right where we were on the call was, I think the first week of it last quarter, probably a couple $100 million of upside there in the quarter due to Chia.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I'm having a hard time reconciling the strong demand trends outlined here on the call with revenues only guided up 2% sequentially. So can you walk through, I guess, where you're seeing supply constraints both HDD and NAND? And are you seeing one more so than the other? And then perhaps to help us understand your, I presumed improving visibility, did your backlog grow sequentially into the June quarter and do you expect it to grow again exiting September? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, so it was an exceptional quarter on growth and there is tightness across both portfolios, there's no doubt about that. We were pushing the factories very, very hard to get every drive we could out of it, because there was demand for it. So when you look at it sequentially, we had a strong quarter and we were basically able to find sales for everything that we could produce. And, so going, so when you look at sequential growth, I guess it's not surprising that there's not a huge amount of top line growth there. But throughout the markets, we continue to, so hard drives we see strength in the cloud. We're seeing really good strength in kind of mid cap as well. It's not just at the top of the market. But on the flat side, again, we've got more customers looking for upside than we do the opposite. So the demand environment is good and we're doing the best we can to satisfy as much as they can with the components we have and with the NAND available.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the very strong results. I had a question on NAND. I think costs in the quarter were up a little bit on a sequential basis. I realize cost downs on a quarterly basis can be very lumpy, and you're coming off a multi quarter stretch of very strong cost downs, but curious what you saw in the quarter from a cost perspective in NAND. And I think in your prepared remarks, Dave, you talked about, your expectations for BiCS4, BiCS5 I'm sorry, being similar to the BiCS4 the ramp, BiCS5 over the next 12 months. If you can kind of set expectations and how we should think about cost downs as you make that transition that will be super helpful? Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Hey, Toshiya, it's Bob. So in terms of the cost takedowns, we actually looked at it mostly year-over-year, and we were a little bit ahead of the 15% goal we have for year-over-year cost declines and continue to feel good about 15% as the long-term goal. We are starting the nodal transition. We did this past quarter to BiCS5 and we'll continue to ramp that hard through the second half. As Dave mentioned, we expect to get the crossover in the fourth calendar quarter. So I think in terms of costs, I think we're in a good place.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. I know forecasting ASPS is difficult, but your implied outlook seems to suggest a decline in hard drive pricing, similar with what you saw last year. And I was wondering, should we assume that your assumption for hard drive gross margins is driven by less favorable mix of retail draws? And as you address that question, could you discuss the mix of long-term agreements you have in place today for nearline drives, and whether those are negotiated both on price and volume or just volume? Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Hi, Karl, it's Bob. I'll start and then Dave can add in. But in terms of the guide on hard drives, we aren't actually guiding specifically by segment. We had really good gross margins on hard drives this quarter above 30% and we're expecting our gross margins to be above 30%, again in Q1 so we feel good about that. And, as we've said, we really want to continue to improve from here. We're going to be very judicious in terms of how we add capacity, because we want to continue to improve our margins over time.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Karl and the long term agreements, we kind of think about those as setting a baseline for volume and price. It doesn't mean that's going to be everything that goes into a certain customer, but it sets a baseline and gives us some visibility over multiple quarters. Like I said, we're kind of working our way through the first cohort of those, and we'll be looking at the second ones in the second half of the year. As I said, I do think they're becoming more important to give us the visibility we need on demand to make sure we make the right investments to support the exabyte growth.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Peter Andrew: Hilda, can we get the next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question, and the first one is for David. Over the past few quarters, you have exceeded your guide by 40%, 50% and I understand there is the supply chain disruption and you want to be prudent. But there's perhaps, there is also some level of conservatism that goes into your guide. And then for Bob, I understand exabyte shipment is improving to September quarter, but I do understand is why is gross margin guidance flattish? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean, there's always some natural conservatism, I think in anything we do. But we also, you know, there's a fair amount of leverage in the model in this quarter we saw when we overachieved on the top line and we get benefit from the tax rate. So and we also had a better pricing environment on drives than we expected, which is, which was great. We took advantage of it. I think we had a market situation that was very, very dynamic. And the team really did a good job of managing through that and getting the most out of that we possibly could. So it was a very dynamic quarter. And also, we're still managing through COVID, which is, there's still a lot of supply chain issues we're working through. I mean, we've been working through these for a long time now and we're very good at managing that. But there is still some risk out there because of that. And so we want to be prudent around the whole business, but we feel good about where we're at. We're very happy with the quarter. Like I said, I think we got the most out of a good situation and really, really driven by strong demand on the cloud and bringing innovation to market. I mean, I think that's the way I think about this. We brought energy-assist to market. We've been talking about it for many quarters now. We've been giving a lot of visibility into the -- to the qualification process, because it is new technology that's been worked on for a very, very long time. And I think our customers are responding very strongly to that and we saw that in the results and the sequential capacity enterprise, exabyte shipments of 49% to really a record level. So we feel really good about where the portfolio is at and customers are really responding to it.
Robert Eulau: So Mehdi, on gross margin, I mean, first of all, we're really pleased with the 5.2 percentage point increase we had in gross margin going from Q3 to Q4. And if you look at the guidance for Q1, it's a range of 33% to 35%. So it's at the midpoint, we're still expecting to see improving gross margin. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're expecting hard drive gross margin to be above 30% again and in terms of the flash side, it will obviously improve, but the mix is different each quarter. And we're going to improve our gross margins and probably don't have quite as healthy a mix, as we had in Q4. But again, still feel really good about the guidance range and I think it will deliver very good margin and very good profitability.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you, and congrats on the really strong results. I was hoping maybe I'm sorry, if I missed this, but can you help handicap the magnitude of impact to top line and margins from the ongoing supply chain issues and the best way that possible? And also for the guide, is there a way to handicap that and Dave, you mentioned the couple of $100 million benefit in the quarter from Chia. I was wondering, do you think that that sustains at some level, as you look into your guide do you have any expectation baked in the guide as well? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: That sustains from Chia. I think we're -- Chia had a big impact on the channel and inventory and it's going to take a little while for that all to normalize. So I think you have a lingering impact there. We're certainly watching overall demand, but it's tapered off from where it was, let's say mid quarter. But clearly a space we're watching. We're watching very closely. I'll ask Bob to comment as well. So it is a little hard to handicap what you're -- I think you're asking, which is how much upside is there if we had all the components we could possibly get? I do think what we do is, with what we have, we change the mix in the portfolio to get the best we can and put the product at the best route to market, whether it's in the channel or somewhere or into retail or somewhere else where we can get the best return for that particular component. But I don't know, Bob do you have any way, not to put you on the spot, but feel free to handicap that from a numbers perspective?
Robert Eulau: No, it's really hard to say. I mean, as Dave said, I mean, particularly on that channel side, we shift a lot during the quarter. So our inventory levels are low there. If you really forced us to guess on the fourth quarter, maybe we missed out on $50 million to $100 million in revenue. But it's very hard to quantify what we would have been able to do had we had all the controllers that we wanted. And as we look at Q1, I mean, we're expecting to be able to manage through the supply chain challenges like we have for the last few quarters. And I don't really know, it's hard to quantify before we even get into the quarter what the supply issues may be, but we're going to we're going to work and it'll be a very dynamic environment and we feel good about the revenue guidance we gave.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks, guys, if I could just quickly follow up. I was wondering just on the margin impact on the guide. Right? So clearly, there are a lot of moving pieces over here, but if you were to think about what impact COVID, Delta variant and some of the things that are happening in Asia, like how are you handicapping that in your margin impact on the guide? Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Well, certainly on the hard drive side, I'm expecting we're going to have the same logistics challenges we've had for the last year or so. So you're going to have something in the neighborhood of 1.2, 1.3 percentage points of headwind on the hard drive side. And we have to continue to work through the COVID situation from a factory perspective and supply chain perspective. And as Dave said, we've been doing it for a lot of quarters now, but the situation is not good in Asia and we need to really, really make sure we're careful in terms of how we work through that.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup.
James Suva: Thank you very much. With NAND pricing going higher spot and contract and such, can you talk to us a little bit about your leverage or flow through the operating margins, because I believe your costs should keep coming lower. Shipping costs, while high it's hard to see them getting worse in the next few months ahead. So may be if you can walk us through the model and normally you have annual price declines with ASPs going higher. Is there more investments needed or more fixit things or talk to us about the flow through or what we consider operating margin leverage.
David Goeckeler: We have a lot of operating leverage in our model and I think you saw that come into play this quarter. I mean, I think it was a really impressive improvement in terms of gross margin sequentially and a lot of what we saw on the pricing side did flow through. I mean, as we said, we saw a lot of demand on the channel driven by Chia in most cases, but across the board, we saw a good environment. And I think the team did a good job of reacting dynamically and trying to properly price the products as we went through the quarter. So we're going to continue to do that same kind of thing as we move forward and we are going to see cost takedowns. We had very good cost takedowns in Q4 on both the hard drive side and on the flash side, and as we keep price flat or even increase price, then that's obviously going to only help in terms of operating leverage.
James Suva: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, in terms of the activity you're doing with cloud and hyperscale and the pickup you're seeing there, can you talk about any qualitatively new customer wins whether it's cloud, hyperscale or data centers with the new 18-terabyte drives? Can you please qualitatively talk about the adoption rate and whether you're seeing greater adoption from existing customers who are transitioning or even new customers that weren't previously on your mass capacity storage drives?
David Goeckeler: Yes, at this point I think it's where they're at in the architectural evolution of their data center of how they're adopting the technology as far as qualification. So first of all, I mean, if you're building a cloud, you're most likely our customer. Hard drives are the lion's share of storage in the cloud. But we're seeing wide adoption, I guess, is the only way I can say it. I mean, it's our customers, different customers, will be at different part, different stages of their architectural evolution, some are going to 18 as fast as they can. Some are working through a 14 transition, let's say in the second half of the year, and then will move to 18. Some are going through 16. So at this point it is just a question of how they're all transitioning their data centers. Again, we saw really strong growth throughout the quarter and as Bob said, it's nearly half of our exabyte ship capacity, enterprise exabyte shipments were on 18. So we feel really good about where the product is and like I said, the innovation of energy-assist has been fully commercialized and has been well received by our customers.
Patrick Ho: Great, thank you very much.
David Goeckeler: Sure thing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In addition to the SSD controller shortages, we've heard of tight HDD controller and preamp chip supply as your ASIC semiconductor partners are pretty constrained and lead times are pretty stretched. And so, if the team had more HDD controller and preamp supply, would you be able to ship more HDDs here in the September quarter or is more of the HDD shipment constraints in September being driven by other component constraints or media and head manufacturing or just potential pandemic related operations disruptions.
Robert Eulau: Harlan, it is Bob. We're basically running at full capacity in the September quarter on the hard drive side, so it's not easy to get the parts and that's definitely true. But in the September quarter, I don't see it as a big factor. We'll see how that plays out as we get to the December quarter and beyond.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Harlan, I was going to say same thing. I mean, we've got folks in the factories working overtime and to get every drive we can out I mean the team is obviously balancing the supply chain issues to get all the components we need, but we've got that covered in September. And so keeping again we're -- these are in places where COVID is a big deal and we've been really good about managing through that, but something got our eye on, but we're really pushing very hard to get all the components we can all the drives, we can.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate the insights. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Sure thing.
Robert Eulau: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays.
Thomas O'Malley: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle about a comment you made earlier, you said that Chia had a big impact on the channel. I'm looking at inventory. Inventory days are flat on a dollars basis, down on a days basis. Can you kind of comment on the mix of inventory? I would assume with some of the HDD activity you saw during the quarter the channel has kind of been wound down a bit. Is there any color you can give on the mix of businesses within the inventory that you have this quarter?
David Goeckeler: Yes, in terms of our inventory and the turns around quite a bit on the hard drive side and I'd say relatively flat, maybe even slightly worse on the flash side and that see you all going through a nodal transition, it's not a big surprise there. So and the flow-through as you saw was up significantly during the quarter.
Thomas O'Malley: Thanks, Guys.
David Goeckeler: Sure, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Great, thanks for taking my question. My question is on capital intensity. Can you talk about gross CapEx for fiscal 22 being $3.1 billion and that would be roughly 15% of fiscal first quarter revenue run rate. Is that the right capital intensity we should be thinking about, maybe you can comment on both HDD and NAND, that would be great? And what kind of assumptions are you expecting in terms of bit growth coming out of the main financial things? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes so a few questions in there. So first of all in terms of CapEx we exited FY 2021 around $3 billion in growth CapEx and that's what we're expecting again in FY 2022. We are well on our way in terms of the ramp on BiCS5 and in terms of the capital investment, and we will have to obviously continue to invest in both businesses. We've got two growing businesses and they are going to require capital going forward. On the hard drive side, we're at the point where we can no longer transition the assets from the client side of the business to the capacity enterprise business. And so that means we have to be pretty cautious in terms of investments we make. That's part of why we've done some of these long term agreements and we're going to continue to be very careful in terms of capacity we've put in place. And on the flash side, the goal as we've been saying is to really grow bits at the rate that the market is growing and we think over the long-term we will be able to do that.
Sidney Ho: Okay, thanks.
David Goeckeler: Sure, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had maybe a bigger picture question. I'm just wondering how you are thinking about the inflationary environment? Are you hearing from many customers that there's some pushback because of less demand given price increases? And then just internally, how are you thinking about managing higher cost and not necessarily next quarter, but just in general as we face more inflation? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, it's a good question Shannon. And we are definitely facing inflationary pressures across the board and we've talked about the semiconductor components already on this call, and we're seeing lead times extend out. We're seeing challenges on the cost side as well. And we're going to -- we think we're going to face that across a number of different commodities. And also the discussion we need to have with our customers as well, and I think most of them are also facing inflationary pressures. So it's not something that you can work out in a single quarter, but I think over time we've got to make sure we're getting obviously an adequate return on investments we're making from a CapEx standpoint and the costs that we have in each of the products.
Shannon Cross: Okay, thank you.
David Goeckeler: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Todorov from Longbow Research.
Nikolay Todorov: Yes, good afternoon guys and congrats on great results from me as well.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Nikolay Todorov: Dave, I think, can you hear me?
David Goeckeler: Oh yes, please go ahead.
Nikolay Todorov: Yes, yes, you talked about more customers looking for upside on the NAND side in the September quarter and it sounds like you are pretty constrained. But if I look at your guide it implies at best a modest low single digit NAND ASP increase. I wonder why you are not able to get better pricing leverage on the NAND? I think you talked about mix changing in the September quarter, if that's the big driver can you please give us more detail, how do you see the mix shifting on the NAND? Is there any lumpiness in the enterprise as the mix in the September quarter? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Yes, no, I think you got it. I mean, again we're running a portfolio across the four or five major pillars; enterprises, SSD, mobile, consumer and anchor the portfolio client SSD and then of course positions in gaming, IoT, automotive, but every quarter the mix is going to be different across that. And obviously the pricing is changing as different rates across those markets. We're clearly trying to shift as much as we can into the higher margin markets, but every quarter the mix is going to be a little bit different. And depending on what our commitments are, we have commitments to customers as to how much we're going to supply in any given quarter. So when you put that all together, the mix is a little different in Q1, and I think that's where you've got some of the difference coming from in the way you're thinking about it.
Nikolay Todorov: Got it, thanks. Good luck, guys.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, thanks for taking the questions guys and congrats on the strong results. I guess it's really -- the question really is around the margins and structural margins on both sides of the business. Do you think over time structurally the margins can move higher from here, and what would be sort of the pushes and pulls or sort of the dynamics, like what would things have to look like, would have to get done on both sides of the business for that to happen and kind of structurally higher, meaningfully, nice, nicely and structurally higher? Thanks a lot.
David Goeckeler: So I think the answer to that is, I don’t think the answer to that is yes. Let's go through each business. On the drive side we saw a big step up this quarter driven by a number of things. We've been talking about the 18-terabyte capacity point is much better for us for a number of quarters now and we saw that play out. We obviously got some benefit from Chi as well, but predominantly innovation led story from my perspective, but we believe this business inside our company needs to be more profitable. We've talked about it several times on this call. We're now looking at this transition from client capacity to capacity enterprise, nearliner enterprise drives that is -- that era is coming to an end. It's been a long one. It's been -- it's taken a decade to go through that transition, but when we look at the exabyte growth going forward that's going to take investment and we want that investment to be fully justified. So and again it's no surprise to me that now we're talking about these more longer-term agreements and again were early days in those, but those are the conversations with customers. I remember when I came in this business, whatever five quarters ago, everything was transacted on a quarterly or even within the quarter basis and now we're moving to -- in parts of the business multi-quarter basis and I think that will continue because we need more visibility into demand to make sure we can continue to fuel the growth of the cloud. I think the cloud is incredible technology. The seminal technology of our era as I talk -- as I like to say and continuing to fuel the growth there is very important and 35% exabyte growth is going to take investments and I think that's going to take, we're going to want to see the internals of our business be able to support that. And on the flash side we're going to, just one financial comment on that. We're also continuing to innovate in hard drives and drive cost down as well. I think we think about cost down is more in the flash business, but we also continue to drive in the drive business, so we have that dynamic working as well. And on flash, we all know about how dynamic the pricing environment is. We feel very good about our technology roadmap, we've talked about that. We're at the transition point to BiCS5. We feel good about that node as we transition to that over the next couple of quarters. We will see our bit growth accelerate and that that foundational investment with Kioxia I think puts us in a very good position to have the technology roadmap, just structurally support margins in the business. Yes, clearly a better pricing environment as we're seeing helps margins in that business. We expect it to be better next quarter, that's the way we're guiding. And as we looked even beyond the second half and we look into next year, we continue to see a strong demand environment that's getting out there pretty far, but from what our customers are telling us telling us of what they think the demand is going to be for their products. Like I said we are more technology dependent than ever. We continue to hear good things about what they're going be asking for next year. So structurally we think with the technology, with the innovation we're driving in both portfolios, that puts us in a good position to continue to drive profitability in these businesses.
Ananda Baruah: That's helpful. Yes, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko Securities America
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. David, on the enterprise SSD front, I think you said it grew 39% quarter-on-quarter, obviously very strong quarter. Just curious if it's driven primarily by end demand and if there were new customer ramps as well? And also if you could talk about if there was any contribution from Chia on the SSD side as well? I think will be helpful. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, the first one just quickly, very minimal contribution from Chia in the enterprise SSD market. Yes, we are happy with the sequential growth of the products, and we did complete a qualification at another cloud Titan, which is something we've had eyes on for a while and we've talked about. We haven't started ramping there yet, but we'll see that in the second half of the year. We also saw good demand in the channel on enterprise SSD. So we qualified with one of the very big players and we see continued growth there. We're seeing good acceptance in the channel and growth there and now we're layering in additional major customers as we go into the second half of the year. So we feel good about how the product is being accepted again. Lot of innovation in our products. We've being talking about that for many quarters, again giving visibility to the qualification process, and now we're well into the ramp and feel good about where we're at and where it's going and how it's being accepted by our customers.
Srini Pajjuri: Thanks David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller from The Benchmark Company.
Mark Miller: Just was wondering the SSD space, do you feel you are picking up share?
David Goeckeler: I suspect we're picking up share as we grow, so I don’t think the market grew sequentially 39%. Again, we're focused on profitable share gains, but this has been a focus for us to get that product introduced. It's a very attractive market and get it qualified in as many places as we can. But we're going to continue driving for growth quarter over quarter.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the last question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Hi good afternoon. You've given some puts and takes about gross margin criteria for hard disk drive. How should we look at the potential for gross margin longer term? You have mentioned you are already at full capacity. Can you go higher given new customer mix and given the purchasing power that some of your large data center customers have without cover to expenses is a longer term 35% in your outlook possible and if you could just provide a bit more color on what you think are the catalysts going forward?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I mean as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client dominated to a business that is cloud dominated is I guess one way to think about it. And if we look at the utilization of our factories, you can see that very clearly, year-over-year the percentage of drives there were headed for the cloud versus the ones that are headed for clients has been steadily shifting over a decade and now we're at the point where we're looking at investments both in  and also when you build a bigger driver it takes longer to test, all those kinds of things, testing, capacity in the factory. So yes, as we go through those conversations, it's really important to understand from our customers what their growth is going to be. We see 30% to 35% exabyte growth in the cloud for the foreseeable future. We want to make sure that they see that same amount. And as we align on that growth and we invest in our business to support it, I think that's where this idea of long-term agreements come in place and to help drive the profitability for the business. We think the innovation is delivering, I mean it starts with delivering a product that is very, solves the customers problem and we're delivering a very strong TCO model with every generation of this product that we build. We're driving a lot of innovation. You know we talked about it here with energy-assist which is something that we've been working on for quite some time. And quite frankly it's a good accomplishment for the team, a great accomplishment. It feels good to take something that was an idea many, many years ago, and now turn it into something where the largest customers in the world are betting their business and their data center on that innovation. And so to continue to fuel that innovation engine we've got we got many, many innovations lined up to continue to drive the portfolio and making sure we can invest in that and meet the growth of our customers. Getting the economics of that right is very important.
Tristan Gerra: Great, thanks for the additional color.
David Goeckeler: Sure, thanks. Thank you. All right everybody thanks for your time today. We really appreciate it. We will be seeing you throughout the quarter. Thanks very much.
Robert Eulau: Yes, thanks everybody.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-04-29 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We reported solid third quarter results above the guidance range provided in January, with revenue of $4.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.02. Sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing momentum of our high capacity energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets. As we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent than ever before. From the intelligent edge to the cloud, data storage is a fundamental component underpinning the global technology architecture. Western Digital's strengths in technology and cost leadership, expansive product portfolio and broad routes to market are providing a foundation upon which we are solidifying our position as an essential building block of the digital economy. These strengths, combined with our increased operational and strategic focus enabled by our new business unit structure, are driving results. As we continue to face a dynamic environment, we are seeing the benefits of the synergistic value in the breadth of Western Digital's portfolio, and our unique ability to deliver both hard drives and flash solutions to our diverse end markets and customer base. Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, the depth and breadth of our product line, distribution channels, cost leadership and customer base are significant differentiators. Our ability to act swiftly and shift bits to meet customer demand in various end markets, ranging from data centers to retail, enabled us to grow both revenue and gross margin in the third quarter. Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, we experienced significant growth in the quarter with our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD in a cloud titan. In addition, we are seeing many cloud customers also utilize NAND flash for their consumer product lines. This creates many opportunities for us as a strategic partner as we continue to diversify and balance the end markets we serve. We are already achieving significant progress in VR headsets, game consoles and other at-home entertainment devices where we have experienced over 10x bit growth last calendar year and expect to double again this calendar year. In Client Devices, continued strength in PC demand, along with the new game console ramps drove sequential revenue growth above typical seasonal trends. Retail remained a high-performing end market as our brand recognition, broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels continue to distinguish Western Digital from our competitors. In particular, it was a solid quarter for gaming with our WD Black product line having maintained strong levels of interest as gamers have gravitated towards more customized solutions. By delivering reliable performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyperrealistic gaming experience, our industry-leading WD Black portfolio is trusted by gamers to perform their best. We are also excited about the future as Western Digital's technology road map and cost leadership will continue to drive our ability to meet customers' needs. BiCS5 is in the midst of a significant ramp, exceeding customers' expectations and delivering the reliability and performance our customers depend upon. Moreover, the technology advancements we made with BiCS5 have allowed us to achieve the scale, efficiency and bit growth needed while using a lower number of layers resulting in lower costs and lower capital intensity. We continue to expect BiCS5 bit crossover later in 2021. Finally, in February, we revealed BiCS6, our next-generation flash device, based on 162 layer and CuA technology, developed in partnership with Kioxia as part of our long-standing successful joint venture, BiCS6 features numerous architectural advancements, including improved lateral scaling, which allows us to deliver this high-performing product at an optimal cost. This marks another major milestone in our 20-year relationship with Kioxia. And together, we will continue to drive innovation to meet the needs of our respective customers in their diverse applications. In HDD, revenue growth was led by capacity enterprise drives, a trend that tilts the overall HDD market to growth as demand for capacity enterprise drives will more than offset the decline in client drives. Meanwhile, retail HDD demand was better than expected, supported by continued work from home, distance learning and at-home entertainment trends. We continue to see enterprise demand stabilizing and expect to pick up as employees return to work. We have completed qualifications for our energy-assisted drives with nearly all our cloud and enterprise customers, including all the cloud titans and expect an aggressive ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives. Building on this success, we've entered into long-term agreements with a number of our cloud titans for 18-terabyte drives. These commitments underscore our product leadership and the importance of capacity enterprise drives to our data center customers. As we continue to navigate challenges brought on by COVID-19, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent. We believe this is a fundamental and sustainable trend, highlighting the importance of Western Digital's broad portfolio of storage solutions, and we're encouraged by what's ahead. In flash, improving pricing trends in the retail and transactional portions of the market are translating to better pricing in a negotiated portions of the market, and we expect this trend to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our unique ability to provide high volumes of flash and hard drive solutions through extensive distribution channels and to diversified end markets provides us with broad demand visibility, enabling our team to optimize product mix and profitability. In the cloud, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong growth in this sector, where NAND flash and hard drives are complementary solutions. We expect the strength to build as we progress through the calendar year, led by the ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives as well as broad-based growth in flash. And while we are excited about these drivers, we are also keeping close watch on some headwinds. To date, we have been able to largely mitigate the impact of the industry-wide semiconductor component shortages through proactive supply chain management. We are, however, experiencing tightness in controllers as well as flash, which could limit potential upside in the future. We also recognize that while the pandemic effects are lessening in some regions, others are unfortunately experiencing another wave of cases. We are actively managing through this environment, which continues to have ongoing impacts to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results.
Robert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the third fiscal quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in January. Flash revenue and gross margin improvement were the primary contributors to the upside versus guidance. Total revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Looking at our end markets, client Devices revenue was $2 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, client SSD revenue was flat and notebook and desktop PC hard drive revenue was down, though it decreased less than what we're used to seeing based on typical seasonality. Gaming revenue grew, while mobile revenue was down on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 53% sequentially, but down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs grew sequentially. We were encouraged to see the sequential growth driven by our new energy-assisted hard drives at the 16- and 18-terabyte capacity points and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD products, both targeted for the cloud and large-scale enterprise OEMs. Lastly, Client Solutions revenue was $888 million, down 12% sequentially and up 8% from a year ago. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially on a blended basis and flat on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 7%, while the average price per hard drive increased 14% to $82. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the third quarter was 27.7%, up 1.3 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in January. Continued success in driving down costs, coupled with an improving pricing environment and our ability to shift bits to more attractive end markets, drove our flash gross margin up 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 30.0%. Our hard drive gross margin was 25%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially. As noted last quarter, production ramp costs of our new energy-assisted drives and a planned reduction in overall units shipped pressured gross margin. This also includes COVID-19-related impact of $31 million or approximately 1.6 percentage points. Operating expenses of $732 million were higher than guidance due to a larger-than-expected variable compensation accrual tied to our improved profitability. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal third quarter was 8%, which was well below our prior expectations and directly resulted in a $0.17 benefit to our earnings per share. We now expect our tax rate to be 17% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $1.02. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share was still well above guidance. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $116 million and free cash flow was negative $11 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of $127 million. In the fiscal third quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million. We'll also be making an additional optional debt payment of $150 million this Friday, highlighting the confidence we have in our cash flow generation for the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage of 2.6x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes a $1 billion add-back of depreciation associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect both hard drive and flash revenue to be up sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect both flash and hard drive gross margin to improve sequentially as well. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $790 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $68 million and $73 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.60 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Now I'll turn it back over to Dave.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. As technology continues to advance, our powerful portfolio will remain centered on developing solutions to our customers' evolving storage needs. Western Digital's unique ability to offer complementary flash and hard drive products benefits the industry, our customers and our company as a whole. While market conditions continue improving, I believe the organization and leadership changes made over the last year are now delivering more agility, better execution and a stronger portfolio and collectively are driving results and unlocking the underlying strengths of Western Digital. We are in a unique leadership position and feel confident that we can continue to drive innovation, while delivering value for all of our stakeholders. We will now begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I guess the first question I have is, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about establishing long-term purchase agreements with some of the cloud customers or cloud titans. Can you help us appreciate that a little bit more? Can you give us any context of how those agreements are structured? Are they volume-related? Are they take and pay? Just any kind of clarity on that. And how that would compare to kind of prior engagements with those customers on product cycles?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Aaron, thank you. Yes, it's something we've been working on for a while, I guess. I mean when I got here a year ago, it kind of struck me that it was a big business and it was very transactional. And the more certainty we could put around, it would be better for all of us, especially going into a world where we're going to be investing capital in this business. We're trying to judge supply and demand and get that right as the market shifts to capacity enterprise. So there are multi-quarter agreements, as you would imagine. And we talk about the amount of demand they are going to have, and we set a price for that period. So as opposed to just going quarter-by-quarter, we're extending that out to multi-quarter agreements to give us both more visibility around the business.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And I guess, maybe somewhat related to that, just thinking about the hard disk drive business as my follow-up is, I guess, a simple question is, how do we go from a 25% gross margin back to what I think is still probably the target of at least 30%, if not higher gross margin in hard disk drives? How do we think about the variables to bring us back to that 30% plus level?
David Goeckeler: Well, I think -- I mean -- so the first part is getting out of COVID. I think we had 1.6% impact on gross margin due to COVID, so that continues to be an issue. And we're all hoping things continue to get better there. Obviously, mix is a question -- an issue as we get more client in the work from home. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely a different margin profile. And then getting to scale on the capacity points where we can continue to drive the costs down. And -- we can't control the pricing in the market, but continuing to deliver a strong TCO proposition for our customers. And that's what we're continuing to do. We believe we have a long road map of continued density and aerial density improvements on HDDs. They're the foundational storage element in the cloud, which I think is a very good place to be. And so we're working on it from all of those angles.
Operator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
Christopher Muse: Yes. I guess first question I was hoping to discuss just overall gross margins. So very nice uplift there. And in particular, your cost sales on the NAND side in the March quarter were fairly spectacular and clearly better than what we saw across most other NAND players. So can that 20% improvement year-on-year continue as we go through the year? And what other kind of drivers should we be thinking about impacting gross margins into June?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So we're happy where the technology is. I mean, I think we're going to -- we're still at our -- we target 15%. In some quarters, we do better, some quarters maybe we do a little worse than that. We're in a good spot. A lot of the portfolio is on BiCS4, which is a very high-performing node for us. So we're very happy with the cost downs. Hopefully, you tuned into Dr. Sivaram's discussion of NAND technology and kind of what's driving, all of this. We do believe very strongly in our technology road map with Kioxia. Between us, we're the biggest investor in NAND. And so we have a lot of confidence in our road map and to be able to sustain that. As we look into the next quarter, we talked about it. We continue to see a good pricing environment. So we expect to continue to get good cost downs in the portfolio and in a rising price environment that puts us in a good spot to drive gross margin.
Christopher Muse: Okay. Very helpful.
Robert Eulau: And we're beginning to ramp our BiCS5 112-layer technology as well, which will continue to help bring the cost down.
Christopher Muse: Great. And then, I guess, can you speak a bit to the rebound you saw in the enterprise HDD side, pretty strong, up 16% sequential units? Can you share with us how to think about 16-, 18-terabyte ramp and the prospect for faster growth as we go through the year?
David Goeckeler: Yes. We expect sequential growth in that market. I think this quarter, we had a good -- we had basically a balanced shipment of our capacity enterprise across 14, 16 and 18, and we see that shifting strongly to 18 sequentially, and we expect that to drive -- we see sequential exabyte growth and also sequential gross margin improvement in the portfolio as we move forward as well.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Also, on the enterprise side, if you could talk about the enterprise NVMe progress that you've had? You're citing a cloud titan customer there. Are there prospects for more? And where would you say -- I know you had a late start with enterprise NVMe. Where would you say your share is? And can you kind of get to where your share in the enterprise is similar to your share and overall NAND?
David Goeckeler: So we're working on calls with the big enterprise OEMs, so that's still in process. As I talked about last time, that's a multi-quarter process. It's going along fine. We're seeing good demand in the channel for that product. So that's a good indication. As far as where we're going to land on share, I mean, I think one of the things to -- we're really running a balanced portfolio across a whole bunch of different markets we're in from client SSD to mobility. I think the big thing for us is to get the enterprise SSD qualified and now start to ship at scale. But we're still going to run a balanced portfolio across the big markets we have, which is client SSD, mobility, enterprise SSD and, of course, retail. And then with things like gaming coming up quickly as well. So we feel good about where the product is. We think it was a major milestone for us last quarter when we got the call done at a cloud titan, and we saw the benefits of that this past quarter.
Joseph Moore: Great. And then my follow-up on 330 basis points of gross margin improvement is pretty significant. Can you give us a qualitative sense of how much of that is coming from NAND versus drives?
Robert Eulau: Well, gross margins were up in both -- I'm sorry, gross margins were up on the flash side. They're actually down sequentially.
Joseph Moore: Yes. I mean more in the June quarter, your guidance.
Robert Eulau: In the June quarter. Yes. Sequentially, will be up in both businesses, probably driven a little bit more on the flash side.
Operator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Congrats on the strong results and outlook. David, you talked about shortages in your NAND business as it relates to controllers and perhaps raw NAND as well. Can you talk a little bit about the actual impact you saw in the quarter? What's embedded in your June quarter guidance and when you'd expect some of these issues to be resolved?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So we're working on -- I mean, obviously, we're working to get as much supply as we can. I mean this past quarter, we did see shortages in controllers, let's say, in places like Chromebooks, where we probably couldn't get as many controllers as we would have liked and could have shipped a little more into that. But in general, what we're able to do is with the supply we have is shift the portfolio around where we get the biggest return for that, whether it's moving those controllers to products in the channel or in retail -- from retail into the channel and vice versa, where we're going to get the highest return. So the agility, I think, that the team is implementing on all of our different go-to-market routes has been very beneficial over the last couple of quarters, and I expect it to be going forward as well. So we're able to mitigate it a little bit. We're not able to completely escape it, but we're going to continue working to get all the supply we can. And we definitely know what the forecast. It's matched to the supply we have. So we don't expect any surprises from that regard.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as a quick follow-up. I just wanted to get your thoughts on NAND supply/demand going forward. Clearly, the near term is looking really good, and you spoke to that in your prepared remarks. But as you start to plan for fiscal '22, what are your thoughts on the overall market supply/demand and your intentions from a CapEx perspective? You obviously want to make the transitions and maintain share, but at the same time, you don't want to flood the market with too much supply. So what's sort of the debate internally?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So you got it right. I mean we're going to invest to maintain share. We feel good about the demand situation. I mean '22 is pretty far out. As you know, of course, we guide 1 quarter at a time, I have to say that. But yes, we continue to see demand as strong into the second half of this year, certainly. I mean we're -- we -- whether it's in the PC market or in the cloud infrastructure market, we're pretty bullish. So we'll manage it through the end of the year and be disciplined with our CapEx investment and go one quarter a time.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Dave, I want to go back to the long-term agreements on 18 TB. Is there any share basis for those agreements? And if not, how much share are you targeting at these customers?
David Goeckeler: Yes. We don't go into that much detail on a customer-by-customer basis. I mean we -- it's fair to say with these customers, we have long-standing and very deep relationships given our position in their data centers and given that 90% of the storage in the cloud is on hard drive. So it's just about getting more visibility of what their plans are and get anything aligned with where we're going and making sure that our business is aligned with where their business is headed. It's kind of as simple as that to give us more visibility and try and move the market, as I said, from this transactional quarter to time to allow us both to plan for what the next several quarters look like.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. And as a follow-up, on the ACD gross margins improving in the June quarter, is that more mix related or lower cost headwinds? Can you just help us think through what you think are more transitory maybe in the cost headwind side versus an improving mix here?
David Goeckeler: A big part of it is mix. I think we've been talking for a long time that 18 capacity point is a better point for us. And as I said, this quarter, we shipped pretty balanced number of 14s, 16s and 18s, and we'll see that tilt strongly to 18s next quarter.
Robert Eulau: And I think the costs will get better quarter-to-quarter as well. We slowed down production a little bit in the March quarter, and we're back at full production here in the June quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini: David, it's been about a year or so since you joined the company. And remember, when you first joined, you were doing somewhere around $250 million of annualized earnings. And fast forward 12 months, you're almost at a $6 annualized earning. Great improvement, but still well below 2017, 2018, when the company was doing north of $10 of earnings. And I'm not asking you to give me forecast or guide for 1 or 2 years out. But I think it would be very helpful if you could articulate your views as to how earnings are going to improve here, assuming that you just continue to execute? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think it's what -- I think you're starting to see the better execution. And on the flash side, build out the portfolio across a number of end markets, which I think that enterprise SSD was a big piece of getting that established with the cloud titans. We clearly have a very strong client SSD portfolio. We have, I think, a very strong retail portfolio. Mobility, we've talked about. We stay qualified with all the top vendors. We very much participate in that market, maybe less than -- definitely less than some others. And then we have a lot of new products coming around gaming and smart home devices, where because of our strong relationships with those big cloud customers that also drive that portfolio gives us kind of a front-row seat as those are developed. So I think it's built out the portfolio and then use our routes to market to deliver the best return we can, given the pricing environment in the market. And I think we're able to do that in flash this quarter and balance the portfolio across all the markets and put the agility in the system to make sure that we're doing that. And I would say from a year ago to where we are now and the way we executed the last quarter, there's just much more agility in the system and to be able to react and get the best outcome we can. In the hard drive side, it's drive -- continue to drive aerial density and leadership, return to a leadership position as we did with 18 and then continue that forward. It's a good market. I think we've had a long-standing position there. And then I think there's -- we've seen the synergy between the 2 portfolios in the client space. We have a great client SSD portfolio where these technologies were substitutes for each other. We had long-standing relationships with those customers where we can manage that transition. And in the data center, they're more complementary technologies, and I think the ability to execute that synergy is in front of us.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on HDD. I believe you're still are restricted with shipment to certain customers, but your primary competitor has continued to ship. How do you see that geography and specific customers there playing to your disadvantage? And I'm assuming that you're still restricted.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We're -- we've been -- since the commerce rules came out, I think back in September, we stopped shipping per the rules. We talked to commerce frequently. We have our own attorneys and outside firms. We know that, that's the right position and that's the position we continue to be in. The licenses are pending with commerce, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't think there's been any -- there hasn't been any movement there recently. As far as what our competitors do, and I can't speak to what they're doing. So I only have insight into our position, and we are clearly not shipping to places where we're not supposed to per commerce department regulation.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: My first question is on the 18-terabyte drives. First of all, congrats on all the qualification. But in terms of the ramp, do you expect your 18-terabyte drives to cross over the 14-terabyte drives exiting this calendar year? And will 18 terabyte be margin accretive right off the bat? Maybe a follow-up to that is, how are you thinking about strategy in terms of ramping 16 versus 18?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So we expect 18 to be the primary -- the highest volume we shipped this quarter. So yes, to the first question, and yes, we expect it to be margin accretive. We expect sequential improvement in HDD gross margin. What was the second question again, please?
Sidney Ho: The second part, it's 16 versus 18. Are you putting all your eggs into the 18-terabyte basket and 16 is just its whatever the customers are asking for?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it's always whatever the customer is asking for. So every customer is at a different point in the evolution of their data center of what they're deploying. Some are still deploying 14 at scale. Some went to 18 as quickly as possible, and others are at different points of deploying 16 or 18. And so we meet the customers where they are in that process. So -- but we expect 18 to be the predominant point going forward. It's just a better TCO equation. So it's -- you would expect the customers to go there when they can, given their own internal architectural evolution.
Sidney Ho: Got it. Maybe a follow-up to the nearline side of things. Given the improvement of -- in the enterprise side that you're seeing and, obviously, the cloud has been strong, what is your expectation for the industry-wide exabyte growth for nearline drive this year? And how do you think you'll stack up against that this year?
David Goeckeler: Yes. We see a quarter of strong growth coming up. I think we're still in that around 35% exabyte growth for the year. So -- and as the market shifts to 18, I think that we're an incrementally stronger position. So that's how I expect the rest of the year to play out.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.
Thomas O'Malley: Congrats on the really nice results. My first question was around end markets. You guys gave some helpful color on the HDD and flash side. Could you talk to what you guys see Client Devices, Data Center Devices and Client Solutions kind of doing into the June quarter? Just any general color would be helpful there.
David Goeckeler: I mean, I think in data center, we expect improvement. I mean I'm trying to think here around modular seasonality. I mean devices are very strong. I mean we saw a lot of strength in PC and client, and I think we continue to see -- we saw -- this past quarter, we saw decline but the way better than seasonal decline. So we expect that to continue. We think that market is strong. Our customers are telling us that market is strong. The number of units shipped is up. So that continues to be a good market. I think data center with 18 ramping stronger. You're going to see growth there. And I think in the retail space, we'll see sequential growth, but probably a little smaller than the others, but still very good performance.
Thomas O'Malley: That's helpful. My follow-up was really around the cadence of gross margins. You guys indicated that you should see some HDD gross margins that are improving sequentially. But can you talk to the cadence for the year? I think that the target longer term is $30 million and even above that. But obviously, with nearline drives becoming a bigger part of the mix and some of this COVID headwinds coming off, can you talk to the progression that you guys are expecting internally? And just kind of the progression from here to the 30s?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think we're going to forecast at 1 quarter at a time, but we're working -- the teams are working very hard to do that they're going to do in any storage market, which has continued to bring down the costs. And as you scale the products, you'll bring down the cost. So I think the whole industry is driving back to 30% gross margins. I think we're going to get there one step at a time, but we're going to work on both sides of it is make sure we've got good supply/demand matching on kind of what the demand is in the market. And then we talked about multi-quarter supply agreements, I think, which helps give some certainty and then work on the cost side a bit. So we're -- every quarter, we're focused on all those elements, and we'll continue to drive it. Now it starts with delivering a great value proposition for our customers and continuing to drive a better TCO equation as we drive higher and higher aerial densities. And we've got a long road map on aerial density improvement. A big piece of that was us implementing or introducing energy assist. And that was a big thing with our 16, 18. As we're now just starting to ramp the '18, we've got energy assist in the market. That's -- there's well over a decade of research behind that, and we've now commercialized it. And so that gives us many generations on that technology to continue to improve aerial density, which is going to improve the TCO equation for our customers.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I'm just curious with regard to your cloud customers. If you believe they're pretty much through the digestion period of the excess capacity? I know we've seen some on a couple of weeks over that they're starting to ramp up CapEx again. But I'm curious what you're hearing from them? And then I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think the word I used last time was cloud digestion abating when we talked about this. But they're all in a slightly different spot, but we're into an ingestion phase for the most part.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I was curious in terms of the tightness in components in overall market. What kind of impact is that having on your working capital? We're looking at some of the movements in AP and inventory.
Robert Eulau: Yes. No, that's a good question. And we definitely are carrying a little more inventory than we normally would, particularly on the hard drive side because of the tightness on controllers. And also, frankly, because of the logistics costs associated with COVID-19, we're putting more products on the ocean and not in the air. So it's definitely having an impact in terms of working capital in that respect. Our accounts payable did go down this quarter. I mean that really was a result of a slowing down on the production in the March quarter, and I think it will come back up again this quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tristan Gerra with Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Just following up on the earlier question about supply/demand. We've had some peers talk about their concern around seen some excess capacity coming in NAND. I know it's too early to pull out an outlook for the next fiscal year, but is capacity in that industry-wide a concern in your view? Or do you see a path that ultimately could get you back to the type of peak gross margin that you reported in earlier back in the 2018 time frame?
David Goeckeler: Yes. It's not something we're overly worried about at this point. I think the industry has been pretty disciplined for the last several years. And I think there's now pretty strong demand in the market. So I mean, we feel pretty good about the balance of supply/demand in the market going forward. I mean, again, there's -- even the -- well, let me just leave it at that. We're pretty happy with where supply/demand balance is. I mean, I think everybody is trying to figure out what's the long-term demand for technology coming out of pandemic. It's kind of a unique situation, so -- but we're staying very close to it. And our view is that industry has been pretty balanced on the whole topic.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investments.
James Suva: And I'll ask both my questions at the same time, and you can answer in any order you want. But the data center softness, is the visibility there getting better, the digestion phase? And are we a long ways to go or kind of mostly through the worst part? Or is demand coming back for that kind of on the data center? And then you mentioned longer-term relationships and contracts with cloud titans and hyperscalers. Do they allow for flexibility and pricing? The reason why I ask is recent NAND pricing came out and it was quite positive. And we just want to make sure that you're not missing the opportunity for better economics from pricing. And so I was just kind of wondering without any specific some of your relationships of quantity and volumes and pricing, are there some abilities to adjust it? Or do you get locked in and maybe pricing will or won't help you?
David Goeckeler: I think your second issue is, without going into all the details, is not a concern for us. On the first issue, I mean, I think we saw, first of all, very strong sequential growth in data center for us this quarter of 53%, although it was down -- I get your point year-over-year. I was very strong compared a year ago on exabyte shipment, but we expect sequential growth there in exabyte shipments on the drive side and I think up on flash as well, maybe not as strong as the expected growth we expect in hard drives as 18 really starts to be the major point in the industry. But we see sequential improvement there, Jim.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Congrats on the strong results. I guess just going back to the flash gross margin and the balance that you guys are seeing right now, do you feel like you're sort of to 30% sooner than expected, which is a positive thing? And if so, how would you like us to think about if supply/demand remains balanced on the flash side? How to think about margins going through the second half of the calendar year? And then I have a quick follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I guess one way to think about that is we delivered above what we guided. So I think we're ahead of where we thought the market would be when we walked into it. And a lot of that is we have really strong exposure to a lot of transactional markets in the channel and in retail. And as price tightens, it allows us to move pricing in those big markets, much faster than other markets, OEM markets, which are quarter-by-quarter phenomena -- I mean, not phenomenon, quarter-by-quarter negotiation. So yes. I mean, I think the market was good for us. And as I said, the go-to-market teams and the BU teams were very agile as far as shifting our supply around on where we could get the best return for it in the quarter. As far as going forward, I mean, we're guiding for sequential improvement in flash gross margin. We're seeing that. We saw the pricing strength that we -- or firmness that we saw in the transactional markets translate into the negotiated markets. I think last quarter, we were waiting to see if that was going to happen. We see that going into Q4. And so we're definitely forecasting incrementally stronger flash margins in this current quarter.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. And it sounds like just structurally, it feels like maybe that could actually follow through just because it feels like the dynamics are more at the beginning as well. I guess my follow-up is, it seems like on your CapEx, it seems like you've lowered the CapEx expectation just slightly for fiscal year '21, if I'm seeing that accurately. And I was just wondering if there's any direct reason for that and what would be underpinning that if there is. And that's it for me.
Robert Eulau: Yes. No, that's a good observation. And we expected CapEx to be around $3 billion this year, pretty much all year. The main delta is we actually sold some real estate this past quarter to the tune of about $100 million.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.
Nikolay Todorov: David, if I heard correctly, you talked about seeing cloud titans also starting to use your client SSD products for their consumer base business. I think that's the first time we hear about that. So can you maybe impact that a little bit? How should we think about the opportunity? And are you addressing those -- that opportunity with your existing portfolio?
David Goeckeler: No, not necessarily our client products. There is some of that because I think the easiest way to think about it is a lot of these big cloud titans also have big consumer portfolios. Whether it's gaming, tablets, VR headsets, that's what I'm talking about us participating in those builds, in those parts of the market as well. And as part of that go-to-market synergy we've talked about, I think we tend to only think of it as HDDs and enterprise SSDs, but it's much broader than that, given the relationship we have from the HDD business with these customers and the depth of the relationship. And they all -- where most of them also have big consumer portfolio as well, whether it's home automation or the kind of things I talked about. So our ability to participate in those parts of the market for flash is just what we're talking about.
Operator: Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.
Srinivas Pajjuri: On the NAND gross margins as well. I didn't hear you talk about K1 costs. So I'm guessing they came down pretty meaningfully. But I guess my question is, as we look through the next few quarters, you do have additional fabs coming online, either it's K2 or Y7. I'm just wondering how we should think about any potential incremental costs from those new factories.
Robert Eulau: Yes. So I don't think we heard quite all the beginning of your comment, but you're correct that the K1 period expenses are immaterial now. We've ramped there to normal volume levels, and so those costs are getting inventory. So it's -- I think we're kind of in a normal state. As New York fabs come on, it's not going to have as big an impact from a start-up cost standpoint as the greenfield that we did with K1. So definitely, you're bringing on some fixed costs, but we'll also be bringing production volumes up and amortizing those costs over a bigger base because we have multiple fabs on a given campus.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.
Steven Fox: Two questions real quick. First of all, on the taxes, Bob, is the 17% tax rate kind of here to stay? Do you think it can go a little bit lower? And then secondly, I apologize if I missed this, but have you talked about sort of the recent trends in high capacity video HDDs? And what you're expecting going forward?
Robert Eulau: I do taxes, and Dave didn't talk about video. So yes, and we -- this has come up in prior calls. I mean we've been in a situation over the last couple of years where our operating profits have been below what we expected. And we have minimum taxes that we have to pay around the world. And so our rate was higher than what we would consider normal the last couple of years. Now as we're forecasting the rest of this fiscal year with the profitability we're expecting, we're very confident in the rate of 17%. And it will be -- as we look to future years, it will be a function of how profitable we are in those years. But right now, I think a good planning number is 17%.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Steven, we haven't talked about high-definition video or in particular, but I mean, one way to think about it is just driving more demand for storage. I think all the devices we carry have more and more capability to store higher definition video, which is just driving the need for more storage per device. So if you have something more specific than that, I'm happy to follow-up on and go...
Steven Fox: Yes. Yes, I just was -- if you could just maybe expand on what you're seeing into the June quarter, like, I think there was some seasonality last quarter. How you have availability to ship to that market?
David Goeckeler: Smart video, the smart video market, I'm sorry, I misinterpreted. Smart video right in the HDD market. We see -- that market has been pretty stable. I think we see some improvement in it. But I mean, I don't think there's anything that's particularly noteworthy, except that it's a good market for us and continue to move forward.
Robert Eulau: Yes, it's a growing market.
David Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Look, we really appreciate you spending time with us. We'll follow up with you throughout the quarter. And again, thanks for joining us. Take care.
Robert Eulau: Yes. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-01-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter. In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue. We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners, and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base, and now an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us. I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers, and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets. As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product roadmap, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys, but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at/or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Growth in Client Devices and Client Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in our Data Center Devices & Solutions end market. Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications. In notebook and desktop, our flash and hard drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers. Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially, with growth in recently introduced 5G phones offset by dynamics within China. Moving on to Data Center Devices & Solutions, revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from 1 year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a cloud titan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification. And as Dave noted, given that a separate cloud titan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 cloud titan qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021. Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. As we discussed, Western Digital has worked hard to position ourselves to address this unabated growth in data and therefore, storage technology. And thanks to these efforts, the market has aligned favorably for us. We're running two industry-leading technology franchises in end markets that will only continue to grow as the digital transformation further accelerates. We know that our HDD business is less encumbered by workload mix shifts today and that our flash business is becoming more and more driven by applications. We also have made the right investments and our joint ventures with Kioxia are a strategic differentiating asset. It is an extremely exciting time for our company as we are focused on capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Accordingly, we will continue building momentum behind our business unit strategies, company positioning, strong brand and industry leading fully portfolio. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of on the nearline hard disk drive market, I know that you talked about some puts and takes with regard to qualification cycles on the 18-terabytes. But I guess the question first of all is can you help us understand what capacity shipments did in the quarter for nearline? And just help us understand the kind of the shape of the ramp that you expect on nearline as far as capacity shift over the next quarter, a couple of quarters, which – however, you want to kind of discuss your expectations on APTV's ramping going forward? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I would say -- thanks, Aaron. So, I would say the mix last quarter was still 14, 16 for the most part. Of course, there are some 18s mixed in there. But as we said, one of big calls that we were working on kind of finished right in the first week of the following quarter. So, we expect that now to start ramping. I think, as I said in the remarks, I think cloud digestion is abating. So, there -- I think the different big players come out of it at different rates. And the first ones are already starting to come out and we expect other ones to pick up as we go through the year. So, the big thing for us is we expect 18 to -- as we get into the middle part of the year, that's where the transition will happen at being the leading capacity point for us. And as that happens, that's good for our business. So, that's basically how we see it.
Aaron Rakers: And what did capacity shipments during the quarter?
David Goeckeler: Bob, do you have the capacity shipment for the quarter?
Bob Eulau: Well, I mean, we don't split it out specifically, but you can see that on the Data Center Devices & Solutions, we were down quite a bit and that was driven both by the capacity enterprise as well as enterprise SSD.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Sure.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Aaron.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Joe.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Thanks for letting me ask the question. In terms of the NAND gross margins, the improvement that you saw in the December quarter sequentially with prices down 6% like-for-like and the improvement that you're seeing in Q1, where is that coming from? And can you remind us where you are with the start-up expenses from the new fab rolling off?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So, I'd say, kind of as we started talking about last quarter, in the more transactional markets, we're seeing pricing get better. We -- we'll see how that flows through to the negotiated markets over the next couple of quarters. But basically, as we went through the quarter, we saw retail and parts of the channel improve. And as far as K1 costs?
Bob Eulau: Yes, I can update you on K1. So, I think I had originally guided to around $50 million in K1 startup costs this quarter and we actually came in around $40 million. And this quarter, the quarter we're now in, will be at normal production volume. So, we're not going to continue reporting start-up costs because we're really not in start-up mode anymore.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of your inventory level, I think you said that the inventory increase was mostly on the drive side. Where are you in terms of your internal NAND inventory?
Bob Eulau: The flash inventory is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We're not -- we haven't really built inventory on the Flash side. We really, as we mentioned in our remarks, really build some inventory in anticipation of the new drive – the new capacity enterprise drives shipping, and that's going to start higher and higher volumes as we go forward.
Joe Moore: Great. Thanks so much.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Bob Eulau: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
David Goeckeler: Hi, there.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the color on the data center side. I was wondering, just given your comments around the qualification timing, can this segment grow in fiscal second-half versus fiscal second-half of 2020, especially given that the comps sort of get tougher by the end of the fiscal year? And your comments on HDD gross margins sort of worsening sequentially, is this basically – are we waiting for one more quarter, basically the end of the fiscal year before we see HDD margins pick up as you get material pickup in AT&T? Or will these cloud sort of abatement plus the OEM pickup help by your fiscal fourth quarter? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Okay. Let me see if I can decompose that a little bit. So yes, we expect a pickup in – as we move throughout the year. I think your call on the gross margin – we see the revenue coming back as we move into next quarter and then getting better throughout the year. We kind of guide one quarter at a time. I don't have the year-over-year number on the top of my head. But you're right on margin. We kind of expect one more quarter of maybe flat to slightly down margin on the drive side, and then we'll start to see that accelerate, especially as we move through into higher percentage of AT&Ts.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari: Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on gross margins in your ECD business, David. So again, as you mentioned, this quarter is going to be flat to down. As you move forward with mix improving, hopefully, COVID costs abating at some point, maybe some of the costs related to energy assist going away. Do you think getting back to 30% over the next year or so is a reasonable target? Or is the margin profile structurally different today versus a year ago, two years ago? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: No. I think you hit on the issues there. I mean, first of all, COVID hit last quarter was about 1.7% of a headwind in that business. In mix, we talked about retail being multi-year high. But we believe as we get – we go into 18, we have a path back to the kind of margin profile you're talking about. We just need to get the mix better. I mean COVID's a bit of a wildcard. How fast the – it's really the freight costs, how fast we can get freight costs to come down. It's been obviously pretty sticky about where it's been for the last couple of quarters. And then as I said, as we move into 18 and we see the cloud digest – fully come out of cloud digestion, I think, you'll see a path back to the more traditional margin structure.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. On the Flash side, can you please provide some color as to what percentage of flash revenue were driven from gaming? And how do you see that trending for the rest of the year? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Gaming is still -- I think it's not as significant as it was last quarter, given last quarter, there was a lot of buy in anticipation of the initial builds. So, I would say it's down a little bit sequentially, but it's still a great market for us because we can play the console side of it and the retail with WD Black, which has been very, very well-received in the retail channels. It is part of the reason, the retail business is doing well, and the margins are good as we're investing in brand in addition to just the product. So sequentially down a little bit, but still expected to be a good market as we move throughout the year.
Mehdi Hosseini: Gotcha. And then one additional follow-up on the flash side. Last earning conference call, you alluded to the fact that you are a couple of quarters away from finalizing contracts with OEMs and as prices or supply demand at Titans, do you see OEMs stepping up and signing longer term contracts, or is this just going to be a guesswork as to how they plan for, especially like one or two quarters out?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think what I talked about last quarter was actually a qualification at the OEMs and that's a multi-quarter activity. The pricing is negotiated on a quarterly basis, and there's a long-term agreement of, let's say, on a year timeframe of what the target share is, but that can move around a little bit. But that gives you a sense about how the market works.
Mehdi Hosseini: But how do you see the dynamics like today compared to like October conference call?
David Goeckeler: Of which part, the call, or the share, or the pricing?
Mehdi Hosseini: Well, the qualification and how I think as you look into remainder of the year, do you see more of a pricing power coming back to the suppliers, or is it still going to be a hard negotiation?
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean -- so the qualification was all about our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product, which is quite a mouthful. But that qualification -- I think last quarter, I said we were scheduled to start a qualification this quarter. I said in October, we were scheduled to start qualification in our fiscal second quarter, which did start and is underway. And that is a multi-quarter process. And assuming it's successful, put us in a stronger position to ship that product into the OEM -- into the big OEM. So it's underway. As I said in the prepared remarks, and I think I've been talking about now for a couple of quarters. The qualification in my book is the last phase of the development process. It can move around a little bit. But the fact that it's underway is a good sign for -- we're working to expand the TAM of that product.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. A question on the NAND side. Can you speak to what's driving the better than seasonal demand in Q1? And then beyond March, how are you thinking about changes in your mix? And what impact that will have on your gross margins? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: So I'll take -- I'll give you a perspective, and share Bob's perspective as well. So we've been talking about retail for several quarters now. It's been good. The team has been doing a great job launching new products. I talked about WD Black in the gaming segment, ArmorLock, security and enterprise SSD, so lot of really good work there. And so that continue -- we expect that there's momentum there, let me put it that way. PC, notebook demand, we still see as being strong. And we talked about what I think was a significant milestone for us this past quarter was finishing the qualification of our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product at one of the cloud titans. And that finished right at the end of the quarter and we started shipping. So that is -- that's accretive as well.
Bob Eulau: Yes. I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think it's -- retail continues to be strong in this work from home environment and the enterprise SSD business will just keep picking up.
C.J. Muse: And just to follow-up on how you're thinking about mix beyond the current quarter and what the implications are for margins?
David Goeckeler: Well, I mean, say a little more. I mean, we're still -- I mean, we still have a – I would say, we're focused on a balanced portfolio. I mean, we're clearly working on improving our position on enterprise SSD. That's been a big goal for the company for -- even before I got here. And our second-generation product is things are going well. I think 150 qualifications now, including one of the big cloud players, which is a good breakthrough. We're still – client SSD is obviously a strength for the company and has been for a while. We talked about gaming last quarter. And then mobile, we still have a healthy mix into mobile. I think we're under-indexed to the market, but we're still in that market because it's very, very important to be in that market. So I expect a balanced mix across that. And then mix in some IoT and automotive and you get most of the portfolio.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. The question I have is on NAND. It's good to see NAND margins improving and price decline moderating. How do you see industry supply-demand balance for the rest of the year maybe compared to what you think a quarter ago? And how do you see your own bit shipment growth this calendar year and kind of the shape of that for the rest of this year? Thanks.
David Goeckeler: I guess what we would say about investment in the industry is we're pretty much where we've been, which we think the industry has been pretty good about this. I mean, there's a lot of variability on investment on supplier by supplier, capital cycles vary, even no transitions within each supplier vary about how much capital require – how much capital is required. In our case, BiCS5 is a very capital-efficient node. BiCS6 will require a little more capital. We'll talk about that when we get there. So we still see a pretty good balance. We see strong demand drivers. We see I think we see bit growth this year, probably low 30s, low to mid-30s, and we see demand above that. So I think nothing we're seeing in the environment surprises us tremendously.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, maybe qualitatively, now that you've been at the company for almost a year, without, I guess, financial quantification, with the two businesses now separated, where do you see the most improvement in the time that you've been here so far? Is it in the R&D side of things? Are you more efficient there, manufacturing supply chain? Where are you seeing the most gains? And where do you think, as you go into your second year, you see more opportunities to improve?
David Goeckeler: So, I guess, what I would say is, first of all, it's been an extraordinary 10 months and especially to join the company at the beginning of a global pandemic that I don't -- that hasn't happened in our lifetimes, at least not mine. And so, I think, it's been -- it's just been extremely impressive to see how the company has responded to that. And the evolution of that in the early days, a lot of issues on the supply side that have just been completely worked out and things are running extremely well. I think we've made a lot of progress on the -- just what you said, really understanding where the synergies of this portfolio are, which are on the go-to-market side, the fact that we bring a broader solution to our customers. And I think we understand our customers' requirements well, given that we can play in both the drive market and the flash market, but that they're very different products. And driving the road maps up, I mean, the technology is extremely important and to separate those in the BU. And I think we -- we're -- it's still pretty early, but the impact of having two very accomplished leaders join an already strong team, it just has an immediate impact on clarifying the road map, understanding where we're investing our R&D dollars, engaging with customers in a way that can drive the portfolio. So I think we've made really good progress there, but I think it will continue to get better as we go when these leaders get -- and the groups get more established. And then the other thing I'll say, which is not really something that I expect to get better. I think it's something that I just always want to reinforce is, the value of the partnership with Kioxia. And I've spent -- given I can't travel, we still spend a lot of time with the leadership there. Obviously, our teams work together on a day-by-day basis. I'm not saying – I’m not pointing this out because it works extraordinarily well, and it's just a tremendous strength of the company, and it's been really great for me to be a part of it over the last 10 months.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Mitch.
Mitch Steves: Hey. How are you doing, sir. I had two questions. I'm actually going to focus a little bit more on the hard disk drive side. So first is just kind of on the margins. If I look at the kind of the run rate of the business right now and I compared it to 2018, it was -- back then, it was kind of a 27% gross margin business on roughly $2 billion of revenue. So, if I assume that COVID-related headwinds and kind of the supply chain issues, or about 100 basis points of headwind to gross margin, am I roughly accurate there? So, I'll start with that one, I have a follow-up after that.
Bob Eulau: Yes, I think it's closer to 170 basis points of headwind.
Mitch Steves: So, the number would have been kind of 27.2, 27.3, in that rough range?
Bob Eulau: Yes. Yes, that's correct.
Mitch Steves: Okay. And then secondly, you guys used to disclose a little bit more detail on the non-compute units. I think those were up pretty significantly Q-over-Q, 8.2 going to 10.1. I'm just curious if you can give us any sort of like directionality in was it more consumer electronics or was it more your branded units are doing better for the quarter?
Bob Eulau: I don't want to get too much into the specifics. So, one of the things we did mention was smart video was up quite a bit sequentially and that's in the non-compute area. But we're just on the hard drive side, on client and notebook, we did really well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays.
Tom O'Malley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is really centered around the transition of the two CloudTitans with the HD qualifications. You said one slipped a little, one came in a bit earlier. Can you talk about what the mix of those transitions kind of net? You talked about obviously, the gross margin slipping into the next quarter, but then kind of recovering. So, we're seeing a bottom there. Do you think that the out quarter is benefiting from this with the one coming in earlier, or do you think it's a negative transaction in the near-term? I just want to get a little bit more color about how it affects the business into March?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I think -- so if you look in last quarter, there was some business we expected to ship on 18 that we didn't because the qualification wasn't done and it actually wrapped up, I think, the first week of January. So, some of that business mixes into other capacity points and some of it goes to other suppliers. But -- and then in the other qualification that we didn't expect to finish until -- it wasn't -- we didn't -- and the schedule was the end of the -- towards the end of this quarter we're in. That actually finished sometime last quarter, very smooth. So, what it says is looking backwards that things could have been a little better if the one would have finished on time, but going -- now they're both behind us. So, going forward, we're in a position to start to ship 18s to both of those customers as they ramp the capacity point. Does that help?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking -- hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the gross margins on the flash side of the business, good to see the inflection in gross margins in December. As you guys mentioned, start-up costs are coming out here in the March quarter. So, that's about 150, 175 basis points gross margin tailwind to NAND. And then on top of that, you're seeing better pricing trends and maybe getting a little bit of benefit from the higher margin trends from your initial shipments of your Gen 2 NVMe products. So, are gross margins approaching 30% here in the March quarter, or maybe if you could just help me understand some of the puts and takes on gross margins for NAND.
Bob Eulau: Yes. So, Harlan, I mean, you talked about a number of the moving parts. And we're definitely, as I said earlier, expecting gross margins to improve on the flash side. We saw in the last quarter, I'd say, very -- good pricing trends in the transactional markets. The OEM markets, we negotiate one quarter a time. So it's – and we did that, obviously, in the middle of last quarter. So it's a little hard to say how much we'll see there. And then we're continuing to do a good job on the other part of the equation, which is cost reduction. We still think we're very confident in our 15% year-over-year cost decline. So I think it's just a question of how pricing plays out as we move forward. But I think we're in a very good place.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Absolutely. And just a follow-up. So many of the suppliers of your HDD and SSD controller chips are seeing tightness in wafer supply, assembly and test capacity. Are your shipments here in the March quarter potentially being somewhat held back because of lack of controller availability from some of your merchant or ASIC controller chip suppliers?
David Goeckeler: Yes, there's no doubt things are tight, and we're not immune from that. I mean, clearly, we have our financial plan covered with components. But when you do go looking for things from the semiconductor supply chain, it is tight right now. So we'll see how it plays out during the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.
Nik Todorov: Yes. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I understand, David, I think you talked about seeing continued momentum in retail and PCs. But maybe we can extend a little bit. I would like to hear your thoughts about how you see those trends persisting as we look forward. I know visibility is probably not as good. But I just want to hear your thoughts, how you're thinking as we go into the following quarters, the demand from PCs and retail and work-from-home specifically?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, it's obviously a very dynamic environment with the pandemic and seeing resurgence in certain parts of the world and more lockdowns in parts of the world. So it's hard to call it more than one quarter a time. We guide one quarter at a time, but I think I understand your question a little bit broader. I guess what I would say is in retail, we've really just dialed in like how to deal with this environment we're in and the dynamic nature of it. And I think that the new products that we've been launching have been well received. Again, I mean the WD Black gaming product, we're doing co-branding with other folks. We introduced a product around security and storage that I think is going to be good for us. So a lot of investment in the brands, which are strong, make sure we keep share of voice high. And it has been an area where we've been able to get some momentum and keep some momentum, I think, going a couple of quarters back. So but it is, to your point, it's very dynamic given the COVID situation and the lockdown. So we'll see above seasonality performance. Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for retail, but we're planning to do a little bit better than that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
David Goeckeler: Hi, there.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I guess if I could just go back to the gross margins on the flash side. Longer term, intermediate and a longer-term view, you guys see a path to sustainably greater than 30% margins. I think you've talked about it in the past. And if so, what are the kind of signpost or mechanisms that need to manifest to have that be the case? Appreciate it.
Bob Eulau: Yes. I guess, I can start with that. And again, as we all know, a lot of this depends on the supply and demand and what's going on with the industry. We've been encouraged, as we said about the pricing in the transactional markets over the last few months. As we move forward, we're pretty confident on the demand side for the year. I mean, there's just obviously a big demand on the mobile side. We think we're going to see very good demand on the enterprise SSDs. We've already had a strong position on client SSDs. So we feel pretty confident on the demand side. And we think the supply side appears to be pretty rational. And I think if that's the case, we should see margins improve from here. But I don't want to put a particular milestone or a particular goal out there, but I think it's going to be a pretty good market in 2021.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think we've been signaling that about 2021 for a couple of quarters now. Again, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do have more exposure to the transactional markets, which helps when things start going in a positive direction, but it's got to flow through to the negotiated market still, and we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters. The other thing I'll highlight on this is really important, and Bob touched on earlier, is just make sure we maintain our cost position. And as I've highlighted a couple of times in the prepared remarks and what I said earlier, with our partner, Kioxia, we're the largest provider of NAND flash memory in the industry. We jointly develop our technology road map. So we're heavily invested in that. We believe we've got tremendous technology that allows us to deliver the power performance bits we need. You see our technology is lower layer count than others. That means it's more efficient process. So we feel good about that; that sets us up to continue to drive the 15% year-over-year cost declines. So we got to make sure we keep our eye on that side of the equation as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup Investments.
Bob Eulau: Hey, Jim.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Hello. And you have implemented a more tightly focused on your two different segments, the flash and HDD segment, and kind of have been out for a little bit now. Have they -- those leaders done the work to where we're actually seeing the fruit of all their efforts now, or are they still implementing a lot of those and the fruit still have to be rolled out of their efforts, because it seems like prior to this, Western Digital has been very much known for a company that sometimes executes very well and other times has a few slip-ups. So I'm just trying to figure out, are we at the mid-point of them implementing all their changes in the early innings? Are we actually at the point now where what they found and discovered and wanted to align that we should expect going forward? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Jim, I think that -- so first of all, I think we see benefits of -- any time you add to leaders to your business that are run multi $10 billion portfolios in the technology space, you're going to get an immediate benefit from that. You just have two more very, very senior business leaders that are looking at the portfolio every day, that are engaging with customers every day, reviewing engineering products every day and providing a level of perspective that is highly developed and their main job is to integrate all the different pieces together into a business. So you're going to see an immediate benefit of that, and we have. But then they're going to start working on, okay, I'm going to start looking at the roadmap of our products and make sure I've got the right fit. I'm investing in the right places. To me, your technology roadmap is kind of like an articulation of the future value of your company. What markets are you going to be in? Where are you going to invest? And the timeline for those payouts are different -- there's different time horizons to that. So if you come into a technology franchise and you own it and you're in the middle of a big engagement with a customer, for example, you now have another person that can get involved in that process and understands immediately how to engage in that in a very senior way, how to communicate information, how to guide their teams and so I think you'll see an immediate benefit. There's other parts of it where we're making decisions on what products are going to come to market in 2 years from now or 3 years from now. And so their job is to really integrate over all of those time horizons and get the best results, given the investment we put in the business. So we've seen benefits already. But there will be more to come. And I think you will see crisper execution, and you'll see that the portfolio is optimized to give us the best return for the investment we're making.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, good afternoon. Gentlemen thank you for letting me ask the question. Hi. I had a question just on, I guess, your Hard Drive business. Your peer spoke about a recovery in data center in the first half of the year. And I'm curious if that resonates with you such that you could achieve 35% ex by growth for your nearline business in fiscal 2021 And I was also hoping you could juxtapose what you're seeing across on-prem and cloud within that nearline business? And then I guess, thirdly, if I may, I was hoping if you can achieve that 35% x by growth, can you do that with your existing capacity today or if you could touch on your capacity expansion plans as well? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: So I think your first part of the question was about what are we seeing when you say enterprise on-prem market. So...
Karl Ackerman: Nearline, specifically.
David Goeckeler: Yes, nearline. I would say it's -- I think the term I used in the prepared remarks was stabilization of the enterprise of the OEM market. And I think that's kind of how we're seeing it. It's on or above forecast of what our customers are telling us. So it looks better. I wouldn't -- it's certainly not pre COVID yet. And it's easier to judge going forward, but not back to where it was. And that's not surprising given the environment we're in. As far as the cloud, we talked about different cloud providers come out of digesting at different rates throughout the year. And then as far as exabyte growth, we see that 32%, 35% in that range, exabyte growth. I think that's been the long-term growth of the industry. We see that going forward. Again, I think coming out of the pandemic, we'll see does that line tilt up or not, given the dependence on technology in the cloud that we all see, but we have yet see that. So we see good growth in the capacity enterprise business as we move through the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, guys. First, I have a clarification for Bob. Bob, on the client devices growing 10%. You said the desktop and notebook grew 20% and video grew 30%, and there was an issue in China. Just trying to understand what that was in mobile in China that you are referring to.
Bob Eulau: Yes. It was actually Huawei, which we talked about last quarter. And so, we're not shipping to Huawei either, on the flash side or on the hard drive side.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I just had a question on CapEx. It seems as if you've shifted a little bit more, I think, from cash CapEx into the flash ventures. And I'm just curious, how we should think about that, if there's anything there? And then also, what are your thoughts on the amount of CapEx that's going to be needed over the next few years as you look at, hopefully, an improving market? Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Yes. No, it's a good question. And first of all, what I would say is in terms of gross CapEx, which we define as the -- our portion of the investments that are made in the flash joint ventures, as well as investments we make on our own balance sheet for the back end of the Flash business as well as the Hard Drive business. We expect gross CapEx of around $3 billion this year, and that's been -- what I've said the last couple of quarters. What's a little different this year relative to last year is that we are investing more on the hard drive side. As we look out over the next few years, I mean the first priority is always going to be reinvest in the business. And so, we'll see how the growth goes over the next few years and make sure that we're investing to support the growth in the market. But I think probably where we’re at right now is about what I would think about for the future.
Shannon Cross: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.
Steven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you just maybe broadly talk about your thinking around edge cloud compute for 2021? It seems like based on what the service providers are talking about, that this could be a year where it starts to pick up noticeably. And so, where do you think you're going to play with NVMe drives versus HDDS? And how you think you're positioned competitively? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think, that's potentially a very deep conversation. So how are we positioned? I think we're positioned actually quite well, because we can play in -- if it's a lot of the heavy lifting of big time storage is HDDs and will be for a long time. But obviously, enterprise SSD is going to be a big growing market there as well. And that's why we're so focused on our NVMe enterprise SSD. As far as how the architecture of the cloud plays out, I mean, clearly, as we have more devices that are enabled at the edge, I think you're going to see more points of compute and storage that get closer to that. I agree with you, this could be -- it could be getting closer. It's been talked about for a while. But I think this is something that's so exciting about our business. I mean, the whole world is more technology-enabled. I think the pandemic accelerated that. I think the architectures to support that are going to continue to evolve. And I think we have the portfolio that's well positioned, no matter how that plays out. We can play on the edge, all the way to the device. And clearly, we play at the foundation of the cloud as well. So, it's a fun place to be.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Dave Goeckeler, for any closing remarks.
David Goeckeler: All right, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate it. We will see you during the quarter. Take care.
Bob Eulau: All right. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-08-06 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities of uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong, due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world in well-established brands; we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships customer relationships are well-aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher than anticipated COVID-19 related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all position Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. Starting with flash, as you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our Enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. Now turning to hard drives, we continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical, heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping two important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5 delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation, while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic in the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus, but we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. Looking at end market, Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work from home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In Gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year, off a low base. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19 related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June, as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth brand recognition. Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19 related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drive -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. Our Flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19 related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity-related to Flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.2 times in the fourth quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8 times. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near-term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships, and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long-term. We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our includes portion of the joint venture, leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment and results are generally in line with expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment, while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. I'll now turn it back over to Dave.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I'm confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past five months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day-in and day-out basis. We're operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership, by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could give us some sense on your 18-terabyte ramp. It appeared that you were expecting that ramp before in the September quarter. It looks like it might have been pushed out further. Can you talk about what's going on there? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track, where we want it to be. We feel good about it. And this is going to be an important quarter for us, but it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks for that. And I was wondering, if you can maybe bridge this quarter-on-quarter gross margin outlook, what the main puts and takes there are? How much are you thinking that the HDD side is going to contribute, given that some of the capacity enterprise weakness was -- capacity enterprise seems like a little bit weaker than what people were thinking? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think, if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs, we don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there. The logistics cost, especially, it's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin so we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And, as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, did I miss anything?
Bob Eulau: No, I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower, so we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about one percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long-term, we're going to be really well-positioned once we get up these product ramps.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks. Just kind of building off that last question a little bit. I mean, when you look at the hard disk drive gross margin at 27.2% and you adjust, it looks like adjusted ex-COVID, looks like it's close to about $32 million. I think it would be helpful just to kind of frame what the expectation is for COVID impact in this quarter? Is it probably not as high, but are we still carrying three percentage points plus of kind of headwind on gross margin? Just kind of any framework there. And on top of that, what are you seeing in pricing dynamics in nearline right now in the market?
David Goeckeler: So I'll take the second one. Bob, can talk a little bit more about the first. All the businesses transacting at AT&T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there in the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers, and that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know, Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic.
Bob Eulau: Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing, but obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know there's a lot of discussion around cloud digestion, kind of mixed data points out there. Relative to the 30% implied nearline capacity ship growth this last quarter, what is your current assessment of the demand from a capacity ship standpoint nearline through the back half of this calendar year, any kind of views on that front?
David Goeckeler: Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of three really strong quarters of exabyte shipment and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or two. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is -- they're all not the same, right. We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards.
Aaron Rakers: So down sequential? Sorry.
David Goeckeler: Yes.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen. I wanted to follow-up to Aaron's last question just on exabyte growth. You obviously -- you actually had a pretty strong quarter for exabyte growth within data center this quarter. But it does sound like the outlook is down sequentially, as you just indicated. I was hoping to you could juxtapose what you're seeing across both on-prem and private cloud environments versus public cloud, as it relates to, I guess, both your hard drive portfolio but also your enterprise SSD portfolio? That's my first question. And for my follow-up, I was hoping you could -- you've obviously been a little bit smaller player in the Enterprise SSD market off late, which has enabled some of the significant share gains. And quite frankly, you've completely turned around your technology portfolio within that Enterprise SSD market. Is your expectation going forward for September, that you should outperform end market demand given some of the share gains you've seen lately? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: So on the Enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in Enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given Enterprise SSD, because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through calls and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter timeframe, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of calls going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many calls going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as a overall market. I mean, well, let me say that response for a different time because that's more PC related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if you could draw any strong conclusions for that.
Bob Eulau: No, I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first one on the hard disk drive one of your competitors had referenced weaker demand trends, especially for client non-compute out of China. And when I -- when I just do a bath to envelope, if that is what's happening and impacting your client non-compute, it seems to me that X-to-Y shipment for that particular segment may have been down by more than 20% on a Q-o-Q basis. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on it? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean, the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video in particular.
Bob Eulau: No, I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. We really see the capacity in Enterprise business and the Smart Video business growing as we look over multiple years.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology. And I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. Thanks for the detailed color. And just my follow-up question has to do with the Flash. You highlighted the fact that your revenues were up 70% or so. But I heard that commentary suggests there is an unfavorable mix shift into the September quarter. Perhaps you could help us better understand dynamic, if you were to elaborate on the mix of your NAND, how SSD and smartphone application are trending? And it seems to me that maybe the game console is happening later in the year? And if you could elaborate on it, it would be great.
Bob Eulau: Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well.
Peter Andrew: Yes, Mehdi. This is Peter. Also don't forget, we do have a little bit of a step-up in the K1 cost, but as you go Q-to-Q, that will be another pressure on the flash gross margins.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. But in terms of the end market mix as it relates to Flash, there is -- you shouldn't assume a significant change?
Bob Eulau: I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it will be that material.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, as it relates to your overall revenue guide for September, down 11% sequentially, should we be thinking that each business is down similar to that rate? Is one doing better than the other? Could you shed a little light on that, please?
David Goeckeler: Sure. I mean, I think we're seeing -- we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong and we've seen that continue through July, and we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud -- again, we talked about that. We see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So, as we said, long-term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near-term, that's how we see the four major businesses.
C.J. Muse: And so if I just read between the lines, given the commentary on retail that would suggest NAND might be a little bit better than HDD?
Bob Eulau: I wouldn't draw specifics --
David Goeckeler: I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail.
C.J. Muse: Okay. And I guess a question on the Flash side and to follow-up on Mehdi's question. For the June quarter, I guess I was a little bit surprised by the lower ASP uplift, but higher bit growth. I guess, can you comment on what drove what drove that? And I guess just to follow-up, should we be assuming similar mix as the June quarter, coupled with an uplift in gaming, to -- as we build out we build out our ASP kind of assumptions?
David Goeckeler: Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean, part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were for Flash were more challenged. So, that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix minus what you said gaming, it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So, that's a good story.
Bob Eulau: Yes, I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs, although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about, in the NAND business, just how comfortable you are. I mean, last year, you -- when things got kind of weak, you guys took underutilization actions to kind of clean up inventory. You're not doing that now. Does that suggest supply/demand is in a healthier place? Or just anything you can kind of tell us about the state of your inventory, customer inventory, and your plan there?
David Goeckeler: Yes, I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So, we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/ demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say something about inventory?
Bob Eulau: Yes. I mean, I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you, the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then bits both supply and demand in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well.
Joe Moore: Okay. And then my follow-up, it sounds like you're pretty comfortable on the adjusted EBITDA covenant calculations for September. But, obviously, memory can be uncertain beyond that. Can you talk about your comfort level overall on the covenants? And is there anything -- any actions you could take if things got worse to sort of make sure you don't have any issues there?
Bob Eulau: So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back to the trough, I was just talking about; we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there.
David Goeckeler: Hey, Joe, also just to put a little bit more transparency into the credit agreement metrics. Please make sure you take a look at the slide deck that's on our website. We've got a lot more detail on that metric in there.
Joe Moore: Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Bob Eulau: Yes.
David Goeckeler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Hi. Good afternoon. I appreciate you guys taking the questions. I guess the first one for me is with regards to the gross margin guidance, could you give us a sense of which part of the business you expect to contract more of the hard drives versus flash? It sounds like on flash there’s slight mix. And on retail, Bob as per your remarks, slight pricing pressure. They're not from OEM contract yet. And then, it sounds like on the hard drive business, it's probably more mix related. Is there anything in addition to that? And then could you just give us a sense of magnitude for each of these businesses? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Bob Eulau: Yes. I mean, I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say, on the flash side, we're seeing pressures, primarily on price and a little bit of mix. And then the K1 cost that we talked about as well.
Ananda Baruah: Right. The K1 costs. And guys, any -- you mentioned about going through a period of digestion in cloud, that dovetails with your top competitors' remarks and also, with the remarks of the hyperscalers. Any context you can provide around just, sort of, do you think that means the cycle is through or the digestion to you guys really just mean like a period of digestion and you think we can get back to some semblance of growth again in the near future?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean, we see 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last five months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle, but I see a really good long-term trend in this and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 1816 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth.
BobEulau: And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the gross margin side. So when you talk about COVID-19 issue, kind of being a little bit better than you guys saw or better than last quarter. How do we think about the bigger drivers for your gross margins going back to 30%? Is there really going to be NAND improvement on pricing? Or is it going to be a lot of supply chain issues? Trying to get an understanding of what's really moving the margins so dramatically on a quarterly basis?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean it's worth important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all continue to drive BiCS5. BiCs4 is a great note for us giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology roadmap that gives us cost advantages, is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- you see us moving more to enterprise SSD things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 1816 terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers, that's a better value proposition for them, that's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob?
BobEulau: Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area and we've got the products to make it happen.
Mitch Steves: Got it. And then just one other small one just on the smartphone cycle, I mean, it's been very clear that some of the bigger products got pushed out right to the time that they're going to ramp up more in Q4 into the Q3. Can you maybe give us an understanding of how that impacts you? And how you guys think about the push out and relates to the flash business?
Bob Eulau: Hey if I can start?
David Goeckeler: I miss the question.
Bob Eulau: I will start. So as you know, we've been underweight mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than was anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So, we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the NAND side, SSD side, I know you probably don't want to comment on how -- how much do you think NAND price is going to come down. But hypothetically, if prices start to decline more rapidly than your cost improvement over the next few quarters, say, 10%, 15%, 20% a quarter, how would you respond to that kind of pricing environment in terms of inventory utilization, CapEx, and so on and so forth? Thanks.
Bob Eulau: Yes, I guess I can start. I mean -- first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So, we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks. It seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So, we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals, but we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming, really coming on in the second half of this year. As you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So, there's a lot of demand drivers and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on demand side.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could take a step back when you were coming up with your guidance sort of from a higher level. How much of it is coming from a lack of visibility versus maybe specific conversations with your customers? And then if you're looking at where there might be an opportunity for upside, where would that be? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So, we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand, and we're factoring all that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see is the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now, we feel really good about that. But we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So, we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. And I think, I said it earlier, we have twice as many various quals going right now as we did last year. And the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably two, three, four dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that, we wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative. There's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, maybe just following up with some of the NAND questions. You talked about the strong demand you're seeing for the BiCS5 product. Given some of the market dynamics that are going on right now, and you mentioned some price erosion and maybe a little bit of inventory that's been built and some digestion. How do you see that potentially affecting the ramp of the BiCS5 product? Does that push it out somewhat or are we going to see maybe a potentially steeper BiCS4 decline as BiCS5 ramps up?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. Our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work, as much as we can, to get as many things on that node as possible, but there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bids this quarter will be on BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. I have a question about the cost on the NAND side. Bob, can you talk about, as BiCS5 ramps, I think previously you said your cost decline expectation is about mid-teens or so annual. As BiCS5 ramps, do you still expect that? And then also on the K1 cost, you said $80 million this quarter is the peak. And if demand continues to remain weak, how should we think about that $80 million coming down over the next few quarters? Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Yes. So, I guess, a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines. And we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5 and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight. We throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or our inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi guys. Just two questions. I was wondering on our hard disk side, on the 18 terabyte, I know you mentioned it's a big product for you. Will you be shipping, and you said more than 1 million units here. So you expect that to ramp a couple million in December quarter? How does that ramp? And also, on the NAND side, it looks like the $80 million cost for Q1 start-up in September is almost like 300 bps of a gross margin headwind. So is that a clear 350 bps of gross of gross margin headwind looks like, so is that the majority of the gross margin headwind on NAND? Or is pricing a bigger factor in there? Thanks.
Bob Eulau: Want me to start?
David Goeckeler: K1.
Bob Eulau: So let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million on the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18 and 16-terabyte product, and we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter.
David Goeckeler: Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing we're at the bottom of the hour and drawing to a close. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.
Peter Andrew: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time to listen to Western Digital today. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Good day.
David Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks, everyone.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, folks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-08-05 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
T. Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to David. 
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. 
 As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities and uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. 
 So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. 
 Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. 
 From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world and well-established brands, we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. 
 As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships are well aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
 Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher-than-anticipated COVID-19-related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. 
 Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all positioned Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. 
 Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. 
 Starting with flash. As you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. 
 To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields, and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. 
 Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially, and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. 
 Now turning to hard drives. We continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. 
 Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. 
 Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping 2 important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5, delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic and the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus. But we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook. 
Robert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. 
 With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. 
 Looking at end market. Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work-from-home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop-related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year off a low base. 
 Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. 
 Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth and brand recognition. 
 Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. 
 As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19-related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drives -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. 
 Our flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19-related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. 
 Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million, and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. 
 Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. 
 Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.2x in the fourth quarter. And our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. 
 Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long term. 
 We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year of 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. 
 Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of the joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. 
 In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment, and results are generally in line with our expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. 
 I'll now turn it back over to Dave. 
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I am confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past 5 months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. 
 All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day in and day out basis. We are operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong, consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. 
Wamsi Mohan: I was hoping you could give us some sense on your 18-terabyte ramp. It appeared that you were expecting that ramp before in the September quarter. It looks like it might have been pushed out further. Can you talk about what's going on there? And I have a follow-up. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track where we want it to be. We feel good about it, and this is going to be an important quarter for us. But it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform. 
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. And I was wondering if you can maybe bridge this quarter-on-quarter gross margin outlook, what the main puts and takes there are. How much are you thinking that the HDD side is going to contribute given that some of the capacity enterprise weakness was -- capacity enterprise seems like a little bit weaker than what people were thinking. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs. We don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there, the logistics cost, especially. It's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin till we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, any -- did I miss anything? 
Robert Eulau: No. I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower. So we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about 1 percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long term, we're going to be really well positioned once we get up these product ramps. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: Just kind of building off that last question a little bit. I mean when you look at the hard disc drive gross margin at 27.2% and you adjust, looks like -- adjusted ex-COVID, looks like it's close to about 32%. I think it would be helpful just to kind of frame what the expectation is for COVID impact in this quarter. Is it -- probably not as high, but are we still carrying 3 percentage points plus of kind of headwind on gross margin? Just kind of any framework there. And on top of that, what are you seeing in pricing dynamics in nearline right now in the market? 
David Goeckeler: So I'll take the second one. Bob can talk a little bit more about the first. The -- all the businesses transacting at 14T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there and the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers. And that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know. Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing. But it obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated. 
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know there's a lot of discussion around cloud digestion, kind of mixed data points out there. Relative to the 30% implied nearline capacity ship growth this last quarter, what is your current assessment of the demand from a capacity ship standpoint nearline through the back half of this calendar year? Any kind of views on that front? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of 3 really strong quarters of exabyte shipment, and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or 2. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is, they're all not the same, right? We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards. 
Aaron Rakers: So down sequential? Sorry. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. 
Karl Ackerman: I wanted to follow up to Aaron's last question just on exabyte growth. You obviously -- you actually had a pretty strong quarter for exabyte growth within data center this quarter. But it does sound like the outlook is down sequentially, as you just indicated. I was hoping if you could juxtapose what you're seeing across both on-prem and private cloud environments versus public cloud as it relates to, I guess, both your hard drive portfolio but also your enterprise SSD portfolio. That's my first question. 
 And for my follow-up, I was hoping you could -- you've obviously been a little bit smaller player in the enterprise SSD market of late, which has enabled some of the significant share gains. And quite frankly, you've completely turned around your technology portfolio within that enterprise SSD market. Is your expectation going forward for September that you should outperform end market demand given some of the share gains you've seen lately? 
David Goeckeler: So on the enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given enterprise SSD because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through quals and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter time frame, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of quals going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many quals going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. 
 On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as an overall market. I mean, well, let me save that response for a different time because that's more PC-related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if we could draw any strong conclusions for that. 
Robert Eulau: No. I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: The first one, on the hard disk drive. One of your competitors had referenced weaker demand trends, especially for client noncompute out of China. And when I just do a back of envelope, if that is what's happening and impacting your client noncompute, it seems to me that your exabyte shipment for that particular segment may have been down by more than 20% on a Q-o-Q basis. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on it. And I have a follow-up. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as a part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video, in particular. 
Robert Eulau: No. I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer-time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. So we really see the capacity in enterprise business and the smart video business growing as we look over multiple years. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But all of the -- I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology, and I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. And just my follow-up question has to do with your -- the flash. You highlighted the fact that your revenues were up 70% or so. But I heard that commentary suggests there is an unfavorable mix shift into the September quarter. Perhaps you could help us better understand the dynamic if you were to elaborate on the mix of your NAND, how SSD and smartphone application are trending? And it seems to me that maybe the game console is happening later in the year. And if you could elaborate on it, it will be great. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well. 
T. Peter Andrew: Yes, Mehdi. This is Peter. Also don't forget, we do have a little bit of a step-up in the K1 cost. But as you go Q-to-Q, that will be another pressure on the flash gross margins. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. But in terms of the end market and mix as it relates to flash, there is -- you shouldn't assume a significant change? 
Robert Eulau: I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it'll be that material. 
Operator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, as it relates to your overall revenue guide for September of down 11% sequentially, should we be thinking that each business is down similar to that rate? Is one doing better than the other? Could you shed a little light on that, please? 
David Goeckeler: Sure. I mean I think we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong. And we've seen that continue through July. And we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud, again, we talked about that, we see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So as we said, long term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near term, that's how we see the 4 major businesses. 
Christopher Muse: And so if I just read between the lines, given the commentary on retail, that would suggest NAND might be a little bit better than HDD? 
Robert Eulau: I wouldn't draw specific -- yes. 
David Goeckeler: I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail. 
Christopher Muse: Okay. And I guess a question on the flash side and to follow up on Mehdi's question. For the June quarter, I guess I was a little bit surprised by the lower ASP uplift but higher bit growth. I guess can you comment on what drove that? And I guess just to follow up, should we be assuming similar mix as the June quarter, coupled with an uplift in gaming, to -- as we build out our ASP kind of assumptions? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were -- for flash were more challenged. So that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix. Minus what you said, gaming, was it -- and it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So that's a good story. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. And I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs. Although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk about in the NAND business, just how comfortable you are. I mean last year, you -- when things got kind of weak, you guys took underutilization actions to kind of clean up inventory. You're not doing that now. Does that suggest supply/demand is in a healthier place? Or just anything you can kind of tell us about the state of your inventory, customer inventory and your plan there. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say anything about inventory? Or... 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then -- bits, both supply and demand, in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well. 
Joseph Moore: Okay. And then for my follow-up, it sounds like you're pretty comfortable on the adjusted EBITDA covenant calculations for September. But obviously, memory can be uncertain beyond that. Can you talk about your comfort level overall on the covenants? And is there anything -- any actions you could take if things got worse to sort of make sure you don't have any issues there? 
Robert Eulau: So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back like to the trough I was just talking about, we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there. 
T. Peter Andrew: Joe, also just to put a little bit more transparency into the credit agreement metrics, please make sure you take a look at the slide deck that's on our website. We've got a lot more detail on that metric in there. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: I guess the first one for me is with regards to the gross margin guidance. Could you give us a sense of which part of the business you expect to contract more of the hard drives versus the flash? It sounds like on flash, there's slight mix, and on retail, Bob, as per your remarks, slight pricing pressure. They're not from OEM contract yet. And then it sounds like on the hard drive business, it's probably more mix related. Is there anything in addition to that? And then could you just give us a sense of magnitude for each of these businesses? And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say on the flash side, we're seeing pressures primarily on price and a little bit of mix and then the K1 costs that we talked about as well. 
Ananda Baruah: Right, the K1 costs. And guys, any -- you mentioned about going through a period of digestion in cloud that dovetails with your top competitors' remarks and also with the remarks of the hyperscalers. Any context you can provide around just sort of do you think that means this cycle is through? Or does digestion to you guys really just mean like a period of digestion and then you think, "We can get back to some semblance of growth again in the near future?" 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- we -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean we see 30%, 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last 5 months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle. But I see a really good long-term trend in this, and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 18, 16 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth. 
Robert Eulau: And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers are working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. 
Mitch Steves: I just wanted to follow up a bit on the gross margin side. So when you talk about COVID-19 issue kind of being a little bit better than you guys saw or better than last quarter, how do we think about the bigger drivers of your gross margins going back to 30%? Is there really going to be a NAND improvement on pricing? Or is it going to be a lot of supply chain issues? I'm trying to get an understanding of what's really moving the margins so dramatically on a quarterly basis. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture of that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean, it's both important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all, continue to BiCS5. BiCS4 is a great node for us, giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition, I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology road map that gives us cost advantages is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- as you see us moving more to enterprise SSD, things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. 
 On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 18-, 16-terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers. That's a better value proposition for them. That's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean I think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area. And we've got the products to make it happen. 
Mitch Steves: Got it. And then just one other small one, just on the smartphone cycle. I mean it's been very clear that some of the bigger products got pushed out, right, so their time -- that they're going to ramp up more in Q4 into the Q3. Can you maybe give us an understanding of how that impacts you? And how you guys think about the push-out as it relates to the flash business? 
Robert Eulau: I guess I can start. 
David Goeckeler: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. What was... 
Robert Eulau: It was on mobile. 
David Goeckeler: Okay. I'm sorry. 
Robert Eulau: I'll start. So as you know, we've been underweight in mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than what's anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: On the NAND side, SSD side, I know you probably don't want to comment on how much do you think NAND price is going to come down. But hypothetically, if prices start to decline more rapidly than your cost improvement over the next few quarters, say, 10%, 15%, 20% a quarter, how would you respond to that kind of pricing environment in terms of inventory utilization, CapEx and so on and so forth? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. I guess I can start. I mean -- and first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's so much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's -- a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, it seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals. But we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming really coming on in the second half of this year, as you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So there's a lot of demand drivers, and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on the demand side. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I was just wondering if you could take a step back when you were coming up with your guidance sort of from a higher level. How much of it is coming from a lack of visibility versus maybe specific conversations with your customers? And then if you're looking at where there might be an opportunity for upside, where would that be? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what's the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand. And we're factoring all of that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see as the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. 
 We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now we feel really good about that, but we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which of them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. I think I said it earlier, we have twice as many quals going right now as we did last year, and the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably 2, 3, 4 dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that. We wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative, there's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter. 
Operator: Our Next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: Dave, maybe just following up on some of the NAND questions. You talked about the strong demand you're seeing for the BiCS5 product. Given some of the market dynamics that are going on right now, and you mentioned some price erosion and maybe a little bit of inventory that's been built and some digestion, how do you see that potentially affecting the ramp of the BiCS5 product? Does that push it out somewhat? Or are we going to see maybe a potentially steeper BiCS4 decline as BiCS5 ramps up? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. So I don't -- our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work as much as we can to get as many things on that node as possible. But there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bits this quarter were beyond BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. 
Srinivas Pajjuri: I have a question about the cost on the NAND side. Bob, can you talk about as BiCS5 ramps, I think previously, you said your cost decline expectation is about mid-teens or so, annual. As BiCS5 ramps, do you still expect that? And then also on the K1 cost, you said $80 million this quarter is the peak. And if demand continues to remain weak, how should we think about that $80 million coming down over the next few quarters? 
Robert Eulau: Yes. So I guess a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines, and we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5, and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight, we throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. 
 And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. 
Vijay Rakesh: Just 2 questions. I was wondering on the hard disc drive side, on the 18-terabyte, I know you mentioned it's a big product for you. Will you be shipping -- and you said more than 1 million units here. So do you expect that to ramp to a couple of million in December quarter? How does that ramp? 
 And also, on the NAND side, it looks like that $80 million cost for Q1 start-up in September is almost like 300 bps of a gross margin headwind. So is that a clear -- 350 bps of gross margin headwind looks like. So is that the majority of the gross margin headwind on NAND? Or is pricing a bigger factor in there? 
Robert Eulau: Do you want me to start? 
David Goeckeler: Yes. You start with K1. 
Robert Eulau: Okay. Yes. Let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million. On the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. 
 And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we're -- we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18- and 16-terabyte product. And we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter. 
David Goeckeler: Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing we're at the bottom of the hour and drawing to a close. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. 
T. Peter Andrew: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for taking the time to listen to Western Digital today. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Good night. 
Robert Eulau: Thanks, everyone. 
David Goeckeler: Thanks, folks.

I would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon, and I hope that you and your families are well given the COVID-19 pandemic we are all facing.I joined Western Digital a little over a month ago because I have strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and how all of us live our daily lives. This transition will continue to rapidly increase the amount of data generated, stored and consumed in the world.Western Digital is uniquely positioned to accelerate and benefit from this transformation as the only company providing a broader array of NAND flash, SSD and HDD solutions. We have a strong portfolio, established footprint, operational scale, brand and great customer relationships from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. On today's call, we'll discuss what we're doing to position the company for continued success and to be best prepared to capture the significant opportunities in front of us.While I couldn't have anticipated the unprecedented series of events that have transpired since I joined the company on March 9, I do believe that the underpinnings of the technology architecture we are all now leveraging on a daily basis has been well established over the past several years. The public cloud rapidly accelerating innovation across a wide array of increasingly intelligent devices, all brought together by high-speed networks.All elements of this architecture are continually upgraded, new cloud APIs, new and more powerful edge and endpoint capabilities and emerging 5G networks. Increased capabilities across any point of this architecture drive incremental opportunity for all that participate in the ecosystem.Data is the critical component that unlocks value across this ecosystem, and our portfolio is well positioned from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. I'm confident our team's innovation in NAND and HDD technologies will drive significant new opportunity for our customers and value for our shareholders. As you can probably tell, I'm excited to be here and see great opportunities for Western Digital.Before we review our results for the third quarter, I would like to address how we are operating amid the COVID-19 pandemic. First and foremost, our priority is to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers. We are carefully following precautionary measures and best practices across our global sites and all production facilities remain operational.We encountered some supply disruptions in the quarter. However, due to the efforts of our operations team, we saw supply trends improve as the quarter progressed. We also incurred additional costs associated with logistics and other manufacturing activity.Demand remained strong in the third quarter as expected. Revenue was $4.2 billion, right at the midpoint of the guidance provided in January.We experienced healthy demand from our major cloud customers throughout the quarter and maintained our leading position in the capacity enterprise drive category. The current environment has accelerated the movement to the cloud, transforming the way businesses operate, students learn, and the way friends and families connect. These trends will continue to drive innovation and data storage growth for a number of years, and we are well positioned.High-capacity hard drives are the foundation to enabling the world's essential zettabyte scale data infrastructure, providing unmatched capacity and TCO efficiency. Our 14-terabyte products continued to perform well, and industry analysts expect this capacity point to remain the industry's highest volume drive, at least through the third quarter of calendar 2020.We are leading the industry in bringing next-generation energy-assisted drives to market as we recognize revenue for our 16- and 18-terabyte drives during the quarter. Customer interest in these products, specifically our 18-terabyte drive is very high and the ramp is on schedule.Customer acceptance of our enterprise SSDs continue to grow. Our latest 96-layer NVMe-based SSDs have completed more than 20 qualifications with well over 100 qualifications in progress at multiple cloud and OEM customers worldwide.Demand for our notebook solutions was greater than expected due to the shift to working from home and e-learning. We experienced record client SSD revenue during the quarter and expect continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.Desktop hard drive revenue was down due to normal seasonality and a shift towards mobile notebook solutions. In addition, smart video hard drive demand was softer than expected as a result of COVID-19.Mobile flash bit shipments remained modest in the quarter, as we strategically managed our exposure to this part of the market. Retail was particularly affected by COVID-19 in a typically seasonally weaker quarter. As we approached the end of the quarter, we experienced a decline in demand from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they started to temporarily close their stores. While many retailers shifted to curbside pickup and began pushing sales through their online channels, we expect physical store closures will create a headwind in our fiscal fourth quarter.Finally, new game consoles are expected to come to market shortly that are reimagining the next-generation of gaming. These new platforms not only utilize nearly one terabit of - terabyte of internal flash storage, but also empower new cloud-based services for gamers, streamers and content creators that will drive incremental cloud storage demand. We remain on track to ship into this new and growing part of the market in the coming quarter.Turning our outlook for the fourth quarter. Demand remains strong, and we expect growth in revenue and profitability. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very dynamic environment for us to manage, but our teams are performing well. Bob will go through the details of our Q4 guidance.I am convinced that Western Digital will play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation underway. The combination of right products, customer engagement and end markets focus provides tremendous opportunities for us.Flash holds the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital. As I mentioned previously, the migration to flash within gaming consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that will enable a multiyear growth opportunity.In hard drives, we have already aligned our portfolio to capitalize on long-term growth areas. Our technology and products are indispensable to the growth of the public cloud, the seminal technology trend of our era. We are the first to market with next-generation energy-assisted drives, and we will continue to deliver new innovations to build upon our aerial density leadership.I joined Western Digital to be at the center of this incredible opportunity, innovating in one of the critical building blocks of the digital world, storage. Given the breadth and strength of our portfolio and the attractive markets we operate in, we need to best position the company for ongoing success.As a result, we have made the decision to suspend our dividend in order to reinvest in the business and support our deleveraging efforts. Bob will go into more details on our deleveraging objectives.Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire Western Digital team, who have come together during this challenging time. It's been incredible to see the support, teamwork and leadership displayed across all levels. Together, I am confident we will get through this and emerge stronger than before.I will now ask Bob to share our financial highlights.
Robert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and welcome to Western Digital. As Dave mentioned, the world has changed in the last few months. I'm impressed by how well the Western Digital team has come together and navigated through this challenging quarter. Results in the fiscal third quarter were generally in line with the guidance provided in January as demand held up well in most of our end markets. We had COVID-19-related impacts, which I will detail in a few minutes.Revenue was $4.2 billion, down 1% sequentially and up 14% from a year ago. By end market, Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 2% on a sequential basis and increased 13% year-over-year. Record client SSD revenue drove most of the sequential and year-over-year growth. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate client SSD will experience another strong quarter of revenue growth.Notebook and PC-related hard drive revenue declined and now represents under 20% of our total HDD revenue. Smart video was a bit weaker than expected, primarily due to COVID-19.And finally, while mobile was up sequentially and year-over-year, we remain under-indexed to this part of the market. Data center devices and solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was up 2% sequentially and up nearly 22% year-over-year. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was flat on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew.Client Solutions revenue was $821 million, down 13% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Our retail business was impacted as we approached the end of the quarter due to COVID-19-related lockdown. These lockdowns will have an impact on our fiscal fourth quarter.Demand remains strong in our end markets as we look into the fiscal fourth quarter. Growth in client devices and data center devices and solutions should more than offset the decline in client solutions.By product category, flash revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 5% sequentially and bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter demand for our flash-based solutions remains strong, and we anticipate that flash prices will rise on a sequential basis.Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 12% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $85, and exabyte shipments were down 6%.As we move on to cost and expenses, please note, all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise with COVID-19 impacts detailed where appropriate.Gross margin for the third quarter was up two percentage points sequentially to 27.9%. The start-up costs of our fab in Kitakami, K1, were $62 million and the COVID-19-related costs in the quarter were $13 million. For clarity, both items are included in the reported non-GAAP gross margin. The COVID-19 costs were primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics and other costs.Our flash gross margin was 26.5%, up seven percentage points from last quarter due to a stronger pricing environment and cost reductions. In the quarter, we began to ship production units out of K1.The hard drive gross margin declined to 29.3% from 30.8% in the prior quarter, mostly due to the COVID-19 impact and mix shifts.Operating expenses were $738 million, slightly lower than expected. Other income and expense was $91 million, higher than expected due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. The tax rate came in at 23.5% in the quarter, which was lower than our prior range of 25% to 27% for the full year.We now estimate our fiscal year 2020 tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Earnings per share was $0.85. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $142 million, and free cash flow was $176 million. Our free cash flow was better than expected in a quarter that is usually seasonally low. So far, in fiscal 2020, we have generated $847 million in free cash flow and expect to generate very good cash flow in the fourth quarter.Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $34 million due to the timing of funds flowing back and forth to the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash, capital expenditures to be an inflow of a couple hundred million dollars.Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion this fiscal year. We are assessing our fiscal 2021 capital expenditures based on the current economic environment.Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.8 billion. In the fiscal third quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders and made an optional $150 million debt paydown. Fiscal year-to-date, we've lowered our debt by about $920 million.Our first priority for cash utilization is to reinvest in the business. Since we are suspending our dividend, our second priority is repayment of debt. Our current plan is to reevaluate the dividend and other shareholder return policies, and our total debt is under $6 billion and our net debt is under $3 billion. Our goal through a cycle is to have a growth leverage in the range of one to 3.5 times EBITDA. Our current debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 5.0 times in the third quarter.I want to make it clear, suspending the dividend is not related to our debt covenants. We have substantial room under our covenants.Moving on to non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.45 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 29% and 31%. This range includes approximately $65 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. We're also anticipating the impact of COVID-19.Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes normal variable compensation expense. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $75 million and $80 million. The tax rate should be between 24% and 25%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $1 and $1.40, assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares. We're using a wider range this quarter, primarily due to the uncertainty in the environment.With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: It's Aaron Rakers from Wells. Maybe I'll start with just asking about it. I think on Slide eight in the prior presentation, you guys gave some commentary around the outlook that you have for the flash business as far as industry supply bit growth, as well as your expectation, I think previously noting that you'd expected mid-30% growth on enterprise, high-capacity nearline drive shipments for the full year.And on the second point, can you just - it looks like you definitely kind of underperformed some of your peers on nearline. Just if you could help us understand what you're seeing in that market relative to the performance we've seen out of your competitors?
David Goeckeler: So the first question, I missed part of it, but it sounded like that was on aligning a supply and demand of bit growth in the second half of the year. So look, I mean, let me start out with what we're seeing right now. I mean, we saw good demand. We saw, as Bob talked about, margins up this quarter.We're - next quarter was, as we expected and as we guided, margins up again. Obviously, as we get into the second half of the year, things get a little more difficult to really project. I think we're looking at various different recovery scenarios and how we will invest in those, and we'll be prudent about how we do that.On the nearline side, I mean, look, we're happy with where the product performed. The 14-terabyte is still performing well. 18-terabyte shipped for revenue this quarter, as we talked about. That we made that commitment, we delivered on that. The ramp is on schedule. We see great interest from that. There's no doubt we're in a little bit of a product transition in the industry, and that will play out over the next couple of quarters, but we're happy with where the portfolio is. Bob, do you have anything to add?
Robert Eulau: No, I think that's a good summary. I mean, we're ramping as planned.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then, Bob, just as a quick follow-up, if I can. I know you mentioned that you've got an ample amount of room as far as your covenants. At 5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, can you just remind us again what those covenants are? What the thresholds look like? I think it was a little bit lower than that. So just refresh us again on the covenants and when maybe covenants change going forward?
Robert Eulau: Yes. So the covenants are related to an adjusted EBITDA number that we use for compliance purposes. And so that the ratio is well below the five we show as a non-GAAP debt-to-EBITDA number. And we, as you saw, made progress in the quarter. Our gross leverage went from 5.7 to 5.0 this quarter. So we're definitely trending in the right direction. And as I said, we have plenty of room under the covenant. We just haven't given a lot of specifics on the actual compliance covenant.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. That is it. Thanks.
Robert Eulau: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. If you could talk about the decision around the dividend, and we've highlighted this is something you should consider. But I just curious how much of it is the current environment and the uncertainties around COVID-19 versus just coming in as a new CEO and wanting to get to these leverage targets before you start paying cash out?
David Goeckeler: You know, like anything, I think it's a combination of a lot of things. But certainly, the current situation, bring some focus to the desire to deleverage a little faster. But the real issue - and of course, the real issue is I come into the business, and the company is really well positioned. When I think - I talked about it in my remarks, when I think about the technology trends that are going on right now, I mean, it's happening in the cloud. Obviously, everybody knows that public cloud is a huge transition. We continue to see incredible growth, and we will. We can talk about that for a long time. We're very well positioned in that market. We perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see the hard drive market of the - the portfolio has been repositioned for that capacity - hard drive capacity enterprise market, and we'll see - actually see that market return to growth after several years of kind of decline and maybe going sideways a little bit.So we're very well indexed to what I think is one of the biggest technology trends we've seen in a very, very long time. And as that continues, that's going to be good for our portfolio. And then we have the flash portfolio, which if you look at the edge, we have just new markets coming online all the time, where we've talked about gaming, and we see VR headsets, all kinds of things are going to drive demand in that side of the market as well. So we're playing - the portfolio is very well positioned, and we have lots of opportunities to invest in the growth of the business. And when I think - when you put that all together, it was the right time to move on to a different model.
Joe Moore: Great. And then as a follow-up. If you could assess the current environment, we see a fair amount of tightness, particularly on enterprise-grade NAND. How much of that do you think is just tight supply/demand of raw NAND versus tighter supply of PCB controllers, things like that? It seems like it's a combination of both. Do you still think that the underlying NAND market is pretty healthy?
Robert Eulau: Yes. We're still very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. And as you know, Joe, we've got goals to get up to 20% market share there. In the short term, you're right, it's a matter of balancing and making sure we've got the right controllers to go with the NAND for that market. And so that's probably the controller side is more of a challenge than the NAND side, but we're very, very optimistic on that business.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman: Hi, good afternoon and welcome to the team Dave. Two questions if I may.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Karl.
Karl Ackerman: Two questions, if I may. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more clarity on when we should expect the volumes of your 16- and 18-terabyte drives to cross over your 14-terabyte drives? I can appreciate your conservatism given limited use of the second half, but should we actually see the 18-terabyte time line accelerate given robust data center demand?
David Goeckeler: Karl, I think one of the things you're going to see from me is I'm going to really focus on forecasting one quarter at a time. So it's not going to happen next quarter, but you knew that. I think we're looking several quarters out, I guess, is what I'll say at this point. I think - will it accelerate given the increased cloud demand we're seeing? We're seeing a lot of demand for that product already. I don't think it's going to accelerate one way or another based on if that demand - I mean, we're basically going to - we have the demand we need to ramp the product. So we're looking forward to it being a great launch now, and the team is very focused on continuing to make supply available, but we're excited about the product.
Karl Ackerman: Thanks. And as a follow-up, if I may. Are you capacity constrained on nearline today? And in NAND, while it's probably difficult to ascertain what your customers' inventory levels are, has NAND inventory on your own balance sheet declined on a days basis in March? And any thoughts on how that could trend in the June quarter?
David Goeckeler: Why don't you take the inventory question?
Robert Eulau: Yes. I can start with the inventory question. So our inventories were up just slightly this quarter. I actually think in the next quarter, you'll see inventories coming down quite a bit because of some of the supply chain challenges. But I'd say everything seems to be an equilibrium in general.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I would say the same thing about the supply. Are we supply constrained? I think the balance is what we expected at this point, right? We continue to see strong demand there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So I have two questions. First one is on the gross margin guide being 29% to 31% on a GAAP basis, I know there is a number of moving parts there. I think, you talked about NAND prices going up. Can you just help us build the bridge between where you were in fiscal Q3 where there's a bunch of expenses included? And how that gets to fiscal Q4?
Robert Eulau: Yes. So Sidney, this is Bob. I'll take that. So the - actually, we probably have more absorption variance and cost headwinds in the fourth fiscal quarter than we had in the third. And we are trying to move prices up where we can in the market as a result of those incremental costs. So it's absorption, it's logistics costs, it's other costs and making sure the environments are safe around the world. So it's actually a bigger challenge in the fourth quarter.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Maybe my follow-up question is, you lowered your gross cash CapEx to $1.7 billion from - I think last quarter, you said $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Just trying to figure out what has changed there in terms of the CapEx plans? I understand for next year, you guys are not ready to give a guidance. But just maybe qualitatively or directionally, how are you thinking about tech migration, wafer capacity additions, those kind of things would be great? Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Yeah. So without talking too much about the specific number, as you know, this was always anticipated to be a low growth CapEx year for us. Because if you go back a year ago, we were reducing the amount of capacity we had. We actually took some off-line about a year ago, as you'll recall. And then along with our partner, we had pushed out some of the CapEx expectations. So we'd always expected this to be a light year. And I still expect CapEx will be up next year. I'm not ready at this point to say how much that will be.
Sidney Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your hard disk drive. You spoke last few years. It seems like you and your competitor are skipping a node. Your competitor may have gained some market share in 16 terabyte, and now you are aggressively qualifying 18. And this has been a pattern for the past two years. How should we think about this looking forward, especially as areal density is going to hit the ceiling? Is there any update on your strategy?And in that context, my follow-up question for David is, this is the first time that you have the mic, if you could please tell us how do you see the company moving forward? And what are the key strategies that you're employing? I understand that you've been on board for probably maybe one or two months, but both NAND and hard disk drives are very dynamic. Things changes on a monthly, quarterly basis. To the extent that you can share with us your long-term vision and your strategy would be very helpful? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Okay. So on the - thanks, Mehdi. On the first question, you're right, we are in a product transition, and we are excited about the 18-terabyte drive. I'm not yet an expert on hard drive areal density, but I've come up to speed on it relatively quickly. I mean, you're right, it's getting harder and harder to drive more density but we have an enormous amount of R&D in this area. And we're going to invest aggressively to make sure we maintain our lead in areal density.And I think you'll hear more from us coming up about that. There's lots of things going on as there always is and in R&D organizations, and that's been one of the things that has not been surprising to me when I came in, but it's great to see is just the depth of talent that's in the organization to drive the road map in that critical technology.And like I said - I mean, this is - when I look at the strategy of the company - I mean, we will have more to say about this in the future. But when I look at this coming in, I think the company is very well positioned in the fact that it made the pivot to flash. And the way I look at the world is how it evolves as you've got this.We're in like almost - it's kind of almost cliché to say it about this unprecedented amount of technological change and always seems to be going faster. But I mean, really, over the last number of years, the change that the cloud and the public cloud is driven and the amount of technological change its pushing on every industry and every company is just astounding. There's lots of reasons for that. And many ways is democratizing the access to the most sophisticated technology, everybody can have it now through an API call. And that's just causing just a huge wave of investment and technological change and advancement for every company, every industry for all of us.Our portfolio is very well positioned to support. We provide one of the key building blocks or fundamental elements of that digital world, storage. And I think in the cloud and our leadership in areal density, we are very, very highly correlated to that growth vector in the industry. But not just that, it's also - on the flash side, you've got the edge and endpoints and what's happening there and they're becoming more sophisticated networks, which is something I'm pretty familiar with, giving my history.Networks are getting faster, that's enabling a lot more higher - much more capable end points to be interconnected, that's driving the flash side of the business. We talked about this in the prepared remarks. Just look at the gaming market, all of a sudden becomes - opens up to this - there's a new market that just opens up to us. And there will be more and more of those happening. And then these two things reinforce each other.The more innovation there is at the edge, on the endpoints, it drives more data, more data that needs to be stored, more data that needs to be processed, insights need to be derived from it. And that becomes kind of this virtuous cycle that happens. And I think the company is very well positioned on both sides of that.So we'll have more to say on how we zero in on that. You're right, it is a very dynamic market. It's very sensitive to supply and demand changes, but the general trajectory is a good one. We're in a good market. It's always great to be in great TAMs that are growing. As I said, even the hard drive business, which is - we've now - I say we, the team here has repositioned the portfolio around capacity enterprise, and you're seeing the growth now come back to that technology base, which is great to see.So look, I'll stop there. We'll have - I'll have more to say in the future. But as I said, I'm super happy to be here. I think it's - I think what this company provides is incredibly fundamental and critical for the world that we're all going to, and we use every day. So - and we'll dial that even more - dial that in more as we go forward. So thanks for the question. I really appreciate it.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. Can you repeat what the K1 charges are in the June quarter? And how you see that progressing through the rest of the calendar year? And then, can you also share with us what COVID expenses you're assuming? And I'm assuming, again, that's all mostly HDD related. And is that something that we should be thinking about as we model out into the back half of the year?
Robert Eulau: Yes. This is Bob. I'll take a cut at this, C.J. I believe I said the K1 costs were at $62 million in the current quarter and guided to around $65 million next quarter. I think that will be roughly the level through the rest of the calendar year, and then you should start to see it drop off pretty quickly next year as volume starts to ramp more. So I think that's kind of the way we're seeing it right now.In terms of COVID-19, we aren't going to get specific in terms of the cost. As I mentioned, we'll have more absorption variances this quarter. We'll also have more logistics costs this quarter and a number of other costs. We're going to be able to partially offset that with pricing. And our customers will share in some of that, but we're still net-net, going to have some headwind there for COVID-19. But I don't want to get too detailed on that because it's just too hard to tell how it will actually play out.
C.J. Muse: Sure. Very helpful. I guess my follow-up question. How are you thinking about managing your bit inventory on the NAND side in terms of, clearly, some of the lack of visibility, uncertainty associated with COVID-19? And so I guess, would love to hear your thoughts on how you're managing the wafers? And as part of that, what kind of visibility do you have to the second half for cloud spending to be sustainable? Thanks so much.
Robert Eulau: Yes. So C.J., as you know, we're just guiding one quarter out right now. As you can imagine, probably like every company, we have multiple scenarios that we're evaluating. As I said, we think inventory is roughly in equilibrium right now. And we'll just have to take it one quarter at a time as we move forward. So far, demand has held out pretty well for us, and we'll just have to see how that continues through the year. But I don't see major changes right now.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. First one, again, on gross margins in the NAND business. Very nice expansion in the March quarter. 90 days ago, you guys talked about gross margins potentially being in the 35% to 40% range in the back half of the year.Again, I appreciate you guys aren't guiding for the full year, but is that still the right appropriate range? Or have things evolved given COVID-19 and its ramifications?
David Goeckeler: So you got it right that we're going to stick to one quarter at a time. But I mean, they're going in the right direction. I mean, the fact - I mean, we - the forecast for next quarter is the forecast for next quarter. We feel good about where the demand is. As Bob said, I think I mentioned it before as well, we're looking at all different kinds of scenarios for the second half of the year. And as we get more information, we'll make decisions about our investment portfolio to support that.So it's not surprising. I think everybody sees the same thing right now. Visibility is a little bit difficult, but it's - we'll see how it goes week-by-week as we go through the quarter.
Toshiya Hari: Understood. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of a follow-up question to Mehdi's question earlier. David, I appreciate you've only been around for a month plus here. But I was hoping you could share maybe one or two things that you'd like to change or improve upon at the company? In response to Mehdi's question, I think you talked about being comfortable with the portfolio and having the confidence in sort of the growth profile of the company.But how about from an operational standpoint? Any one or two things that you hope to change or improve upon, I guess, as an add-on to that? If you had to pick one or two kind of financial metrics that you tend to focus on and prioritize, if you can kind of speak to those, that would be helpful, whether it'd be revenue or margins, EPS, cash flow? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes, Toshi, I mean, I think it's - I appreciate the question. I guess I'll say in general, it's a difficult quarter to draw lots of long-term conclusions about much of anything right now. The - I will say, the operations team has just done an incredible job. I mean, I've watched this play out now over the last seven weeks or so that I've been here.And we have a global footprint with factories and fabs all over the world, China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, here in the U.S. And to see how all the best practices have been shared, and all of those have been kept open and functioning at some level and then increasing capabilities, working with our suppliers, I think that's a tremendous strength of the company.Again, I have more to say about that later. But again, I think this - the past seven weeks is not a time where you want to look at anything and draw a really long-term conclusion given the dynamic situation we're in.As far as financial metrics, there is lots of good ones. Clearly, gross margin is something we're going to be very focused on, making sure we're investing our resources in the places that can draw the highest return. That is obviously a very big focus and cash generation, quite honestly, and make sure we're managing for that. So those are two that are at the top of a whole long list.
Toshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Mike Cadiz: Hi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Jim Suva at Citi. Gentlemen, would you mind giving us a little more color, please, on the current factory utilization levels? And secondly, an overview on the health of your component supply chain at this time? I appreciate it. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Yes. I think that it's been improving week over week. And as it stands right now, we're in good shape. Obviously, it's an incredibly dynamic situation. I'll say that right from the start. I mean, every day, it changes. And every day, of course, you get new information and make the best decision about how you're going to move forward, but the team has done a great job of that, kept things open the whole time.Literally, over the past two or three weeks, things have gotten significantly stronger, and it puts us in a position right now where I think we're - I don't want to use the term normal because I don't think anything is normal in the world right now, but we're operating at a level that - I mean, obviously, we're operating at a level that can support the forecast that we just put forward.So I feel really good about what the team has done and the position they've put us in around the world. And we're staying super vigilant to make sure, one, that we implement best practices across all of our facilities.We are working from home at a significant level everywhere we can, and that's making the situation better. But the people that have to come in to keep the businesses running. And as you know, we are an essential business. And everywhere we operate, that hasn't been an issue about getting any kind of authorization to operate, but making sure that the people that are in, the facilities are safe, and we've had good success there as well.Our supply chain, we've been working with our supply chain. We've been helping out our supply chain to make sure they get the appropriate government release to continue to operate. We've been doing some diversification of that to fill some gaps and some non-regrets moves on that. But right now, the supply chain, again, it's the same thing as our own facilities. It's - week by week, it's gotten better to a point where right now we feel like we're in a relatively strong position.
Robert Eulau: Yes. I mean, where all vendors producing at this point, and that could change when everybody's producing it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two couple of small ones, I guess. So the first one just regard to the dividend and kind of cancellation there. So what type of leverage metric are you guys trying to get to? Or is there any sort of way to think about when it will be reinstated in terms of a financial metric?And then secondly, just given the supply chain disruptions of what we're seeing in economic wide disruptions, what's the new view in terms of what you guys believe smartphone units will look like out, call it, 12 to 24 months, whatever time frame you want to use?
Robert Eulau: All right. Mitch, it's Bob. I'll start. One of the things we've done is we've studied the capital structure quite a bit. And what we've concluded is, obviously, it's a cyclical business. We want to have a growth leverage that works for us through the cycle. We're expecting, as we bring our debt levels down, that we'll manage to anywhere from one to 3.5 times EBITDA depending on where we are in the cycle. And as I mentioned, the goal is to get our gross debt down to about $6 billion and our net debt to $3 billion. And yes, I don't know if you want to take.
David Goeckeler: First of all, hey, Mitch. How are you doing? Thanks for the question. I don't think we forecast smartphone units. I mean, again, the second half and what's going to happen. We're going to take it quarter-by-quarter at this point. We - obviously, we feel good about our guide for the next quarter and what we see on the supply and demand side to have a lot of confidence in that. And we'll have more to say about the second half next quarter.
Robert Eulau: Yes. The thing I would add, as you recall, Mitch, I mean, we're under-indexed to the mobile phone market. So we're not trying to forecast it, and we're not as exposed to it as some of our customers - I'm sorry, some of our competitors.
Mitch Steves: Understood. Thanks.
David Goeckeler: Thanks, Mitch.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. I just had a question on the retail channel. You mentioned there's - obviously, there's a pretty big disruption in the channel right now. Can you talk about, one, how it impacted the guidance for the current quarter?And then secondly, when we think about sort of those brands, which are pretty strong in retail league, Western Digital and the old SanDisk products, you're sort of focus on those longer-term given that you could probably redeploy those bits and heads and media into more profitable areas? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: So I think as we talked about for the fourth quarter, we expect some headwinds in that business. I think it's typically a seasonally weak quarter anyway. And obviously, with stores not being open, it makes it a lot tougher. Last quarter, as we talked about towards the end of the quarter, we obviously saw a deterioration as stores were closed. And we also saw the mix shift to lower-margin products as well.We've got that all factored into the guide. I mean - again, we're very comfortable with the guide. The guide is a guide. And so we've got all the dynamics that we expect to happen in the retail channel baked into those numbers.Longer term, again, we'll have more to say about longer-term strategy. But I think it's a great strength of the company, those brands. I think it's an area where we can drive differentiation and we can drive margin in those channels as well. They're not just - it's not just all low-margin business.So I feel good about that capability. And honestly, it's one of the things that attracted me to the company. So we'll - again, we'll have more to say about what the long-term strategy is there, but I think it's definitely an asset.
Steven Fox: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck going forward.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Dave, I guess, I'm trying to understand the current demand is sustainable, I guess, into the second half. I guess we are all trying to do that at this point. But what I'm trying to get at is that you guys tend to have pretty good visibility on the hyperscale cloud side given your design cycles.I just want to hear your thoughts as to what your customers are saying about the second half? And what sort of design activity on the drive side you're seeing? Any thoughts would be helpful?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Again, I always couch everything we're going to guide one quarter at a time, but it's a fair question. I mean, we - I guess the only thing we can say is we continue to see strong demand from the big cloud vendors, cloud suppliers. There's always a question, are they building inventory, are they buying ahead, the old consumption digestion kind of thing. Everything we see is there's strong demand for what their products are. I think they're saying the same thing. Not saying anything new there.How long it lasts? I mean, what I talked about in the intro of - in my prepared remarks, I mean, I think this world that we're all living in because of COVID-19, where there's just a lot more work at home, learn at home, there's just a lot more dependence on cloud and endpoint technology, I think that architecture has been set for some time now, and it's impacting every business. We've seen a massive acceleration to that, unfortunately, because of a global pandemic.The question is how much - is that going to continue to stay as it starts to subside? I don't - obviously, there'll be some variability in that given that there's so many people at home now. But like I said, I think the model is set, and I think it's how fast we're going to get there. I don't think there's a question on is it the right destination? So we'll see as we move into the second half.Our conversations with all those customers continue to be fantastic, you're right. One of the things that's been great as I've come into this company, is just to understand the depth of our relationship and the strength of our footprint and those customers is extremely impressive.And so we're going to stay very close to them and continue to work with them as they build out their infrastructure. But right now, I don't think - we don't have any sign that - well, I think what we're seeing is the increased demand and nothing tells us that it's nothing but real demand. And how far it extends into the second half, we'll see as we get more visibility.
Srini Pajjuri: Helpful. Thank you. And then, Bob, I guess, as you try to improve the free cash flow going forward, a couple of line items, I want to hear your thoughts on. First, on the OpEx. And then the other thing I noticed is that you've been paying a fairly high tax rate, relatively speaking, at least on a non-GAAP basis compared to your semi peers. I'm just curious as to why that is? And when do you expect that to come down? Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Yes. So two good questions. OpEx, I think the best assumption is it will be around the levels we guided to this quarter for the next few quarters anyway.On the tax rate, the dilemma is we have a fantastic structure when we're making more money than we are right now. And so right now, when our profitability levels are relatively low, we have certain minimum taxes we have to pay around the world and it makes our tax rate quite high. So it will come down as the overall profitability starts to come up.
Srini Pajjuri: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like the team saw continued strong growth in the ramp of your new enterprise SSD platforms. I know you guys are targeting 20% market share. But based on your shipments in the March quarter and assumption on industry shipments, did you guys actually achieve double-digit percentage market share in the March quarter?
Robert Eulau: Yes. I'd say the share was fairly flat. That market is growing quite a bit. So we're - as I mentioned earlier, we're a bit constrained on controllers right now, but the demand is definitely there.
Harlan Sur: Okay. Great. And then on the COVID-19 operational issues, team, maybe just give us a bit more color on where these are coming from? I know that you guys - there are shelter-in-place and movement control in the Bay Area, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, all of the areas where you guys have a footprint of operations. Any geographies, which are creating more of a pressure point from an operational or a logistics perspective? Thank you.
David Goeckeler: I don't really want to call out any one area over another because it -one, it changes quite a bit based on local situations. But obviously, if - there's a couple of different categories things fall in to. First is logistics. It's gotten more expensive to get to move stuff around. A lot of stuff went on domestic flight. So there's a lot or passenger flights. There's a lot fewer of those. So those costs are going up. Just the general number of places that are open and how difficult it is to move things around is a big category of cost.And then in places where we maybe do have a little bit of under - we can't run at full capacity, although that's getting to be less and less of an issue over the last couple of weeks there's some absorption costs that Bob talked about. And then there's some just general costs of just increased cleaning and those kinds of things. But those are relatively minor based on the other two. I don't know, Bob, anything else come to mind?
Robert Eulau: No, I think that's right. I mean, I think certainly, May will be better than April, and I think June will be even a little better than May.
David Goeckeler: Yes. It really has been a week over week. It's gotten much better.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Please go ahead.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. We've been reading recently about HDD pricing going up to match higher logistical costs. What's your sense of pricing in HDD going forward? And will the supply disruption create potentially an environment where pricing could be favorable for the next few quarters?
David Goeckeler: Oh, I don't know about for the next few quarters. But we have been somewhat successful in moving pricing to cover some of the increased costs. I think that's what our focus is on anything around pricing in the industry. But we're not looking at it. We're looking at it in the sense of what it takes to cover the increased costs that we have in the business. And we have a good idea what those are going to be for next quarter. And when we get there, we'll figure out what's going to happen in that. Bob, anything to add to that?
Robert Eulau: No, I agree.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You've talked a lot about supply chain disruptions, but - and how this has improved recently. But is there a quantification that you could put into maybe a percentage of output that's currently for this current quarter going to be impacted by those disruptions? I know that you've talked about your expectation for inventory levels to come down. Just trying to put things together in terms of whether there is still a meaningful impact - material impact on the supply coming from those disruptions this quarter?
David Goeckeler: Yes. I don't want to put a specific number on it because the potential - it's a very - as I said - said several times, a very dynamic environment. I would say that we have confidence in the supply - what the supply that's going to be produced to support the guide for the next quarter. We have a lot of confidence in that. But it could - things change every day. But I said the trend has been going - it's been getting better and better to where it's given us the confidence to put the guide in place that we have.
Tristan Gerra: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The last question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital before we end with a short statement by our CEO. Please go ahead.
Weston Twigg: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of quick ones. First, I was just wondering if you had a chance to look at the recent commerce rule change regarding company military exposure in China, Russia and Venezuela. I think specifically in China, you had previously said you have 20% to 25% exposure. And I'm wondering if you had a chance to think about how much of that might fall under the new definition under this rule?
David Goeckeler: We've had a chance to take a quick look at it. And we don't believe it will have a material impact on our business. But obviously, we're going to monitor it very, very closely.
Weston Twigg: That makes sense. That's helpful. And then the other question I had was just on notebooks. It's been a big driver of near-term revenue. Can you talk about the density trends in notebooks in the back half of the year if that might be - I don't know if it's stable or going up or not, but if that might be an offset if units are down?
David Goeckeler: Yes. Again, we're going to stick to talking about things for next quarter. I don't have anything in particularly insightful to say about density trends and notebooks at this point. Bob, I don't know if you do.
Robert Eulau: Yes. No, I don't. I mean, obviously, it's come up over the last year, but I think as we go forward, we don't really know.
David Goeckeler: We can follow-up with you with some more details.
Weston Twigg: All right. Sounds good. Thank you.
David Goeckeler: Thank you, Weston.
David Goeckeler: All right. Thank all of you for joining us here today. We look forward to seeing you virtually at the upcoming JPMorgan and Bank of America conferences. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
Robert Eulau: Yes. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-01-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Steve Milligan, Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations, business plans, trends in financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Milligan: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon. Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range and non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. Our performance reflects strong execution in our product roadmap, success in increasing our hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash environment. Notably, these results reinforce our prior comments that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle. We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives in December. These drives feature our energy-assisted magnetic recording technology providing unrivaled areal density and TCO benefits. We expect to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of calendar 2020. Our 14-terabyte platform is performing well, and customer interest in our air based 10-terabyte drive is quite high. The strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow us to maintain our leading market share position. We achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe design wins, including at another major hyperscale customer positioning us for continued revenue growth and share gains. We made it an important announcement this afternoon of our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5, with 112 layers of vertical storage. BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest density and most advanced 3D NAND to date, delivering exceptional performance and reliability. Our team executed well in the quarter, increasing our hard drive non-GAAP gross margins to approximately 31% from 28.5% in the prior quarter. We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020 with continued improvement through the end of the year. I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Mike Cordano: Thank you and good afternoon. Our December results reflect solid product execution, an increase in hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash market environment.  Data Center Devices and Solutions, we executed well in delivering new products, positioning us for continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020. In capacity enterprise drives, close collaboration between our head, media, and mechanical design teams allowed us to simultaneously introduce energy-assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple-stage actuator in our new 16, 18, and 20 terabyte drives. These innovations provide us with continued areal density leadership and a greater design margin resulting in best-in-class product quality and reliability. Our focus on introducing the right technology at the right time, while delivering the best TCO and highest product quality to hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner. In calendar year 2019, the success of our capacity enterprise product line led by our 14-terabyte drive drove over 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We also started sampling our 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the current quarter. As these drives ramp along with our 10-terabyte air-based drives, we are well positioned for continued leadership. In flash, we achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share as our NVMe based enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50% sequentially. Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was better than expected. I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin, higher growth, and lower volatility parts of the flash market. We have secured additional design wins, including another major hyperscale customer, which demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base. In calendar year 2020, we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue as we move towards our goal of 20% market share. Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled, built on the breadth of our product portfolio, strong customer relationships, technology leadership, and superior product quality. We look forward to another year of strong growth in the data center market. Client Devices, strong growth in client SSD, and smart video along with growth in mobility and desktop hard drives drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter. As we enter the March quarter, flash pricing continues to improve. Furthermore, starting in the June quarter, we expect to begin shipments into a new gaming platform. The gaming console market is expected to be a multi-exabyte opportunity this calendar year. Within Client Solutions, strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue to grow on a sequential basis. At CES 2020, we demonstrated a range of innovative products including the world's highest capacity, pocket-sized, portable SSD and the world's first USB 3.2 SSD exclusively for gaming. This afternoon, we announced our fifth generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5. Utilizing a wide range of new technology and manufacturing innovation, BiCS5 has significantly increased cell array density horizontally across the wafer. These lateral scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40% more bits of storage capacity per wafer compared to Western Digital's 96-layer BiCS4 technology. We have commenced shipping initial consumer products built on BiCS5 with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year. We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels, and with strong demand for our products we are experiencing pockets of tightness. These dynamics combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives position us well for continued profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.
Bob Eulau: Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a year ago. Please recall that the September quarter was a 14-week quarter. By end markets, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was down 3% sequentially and up nearly 40% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, growth in enterprise SSD was offset by a decline in capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage-system business. Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 11% on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20% year-over-year. As Mike noted earlier, the sequential growth was driven by client SSD, smart video, mobility, and desktop HDD. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash, our decision to limit our participation in mobility, and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives. Client Solutions revenue was $948 million, up 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by strength in hard drives. By product category, flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 8% sequentially, primarily related to our increased participation in mobility. Bit shipments were up 24% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, roughly flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Average price per hard drive was flat sequentially at $81. And exabyte shipments were down 1% sequentially. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1.1 percentage point sequentially to 25.9%. Our flash gross margin was 19.5%, up slightly from last quarter, as a better pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile. The hard drive gross margin grew more than expected to almost 31% from 28.5% the prior quarter. This improvement was due to the full realization of the cost benefits of the KL closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive sequentially flat at $81. Operating expenses were $765 million. Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense would have been closer to $720 million. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $257 million and free cash flow was $377 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were an inflow of $120 million. As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to zero. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. An effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures, we've added a few new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. In the December quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders. We reduced debt by $388 million, which included an optional $325 million debt pay-down. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After that, paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our $2.25 billion revolver remained unused and our gross debt outstanding was just under $10 billion. Total inventory dollars were down $165 million on a sequential basis as both hard drive and flash inventory decrease. Moving on, our non-GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 28.5% to 29.5%. Please note that this range includes approximately $70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense, in selective new R&D investment. We expect interest and other expense of $80 million to $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be around to be between 25% and 27%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.85 and $1.05, assuming approximately $305 million in fully diluted shares. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you and congrats on the strong guidance. When you speak of an accelerated recovery here in flash gross margins, can you layout the key drivers of that through 2020 and how you're thinking about the velocity of that recovery and any thoughts on where you might exit the calendar year?
Steve Milligan: Yes, Wamsi, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So, there's really a couple of different things that I would say are going on in terms of the flash market. One, the first thing is as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we believe that inventory levels in – from an industry perspective to the best of our estimation have returned in the balance or call it normal levels. So, that's one thing that occurred. The other thing is, is obviously we have been working very hard on improving our product lineup, which is allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles as well as their stickier business, and we believe that that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash business. The other thing is that, as part of all that is, is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer base that that inventory supply and demand is tightening up. In other words, demand is going to exceed supply this year. And so, we're seeing customers recognizing that. Prices are improving. Right now, that tightness is, it's kind of in pockets. It's not necessarily across the board. So we're seeing pockets of tightness in the market, and as we move through the balance of the year, we expect that that tightness will increase. And so what that means from a gross margin perspective, last quarter we said that we thought we would see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area. Now, we're saying that our margin profile will – it will accelerate in terms of that improvement, and I would expect as we move into the back half of the year, we'll see an increasing – more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back half of calendar 2020. What that means from a numeric perspective is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our flash gross margins to get into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the calendar year.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, great. That's great, Steve. Thanks. Appreciate the color. And can you maybe just and you guys obviously executed pretty well in the quarter on the HDD side as you had guided to sort of have those margins step up as well. Can you talk about the path of the HDD gross margins from here as well? Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Yes, I think the way to think about those is we're in a range where we're comfortable going forward. So we will continue to operate around the range that we reported.
Steve Milligan: With a bias -- Wamsi, I would add to that. With a bias for those margins improving over time as an increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise. So what we've talked about is something in the mid-30% range. We're not necessarily saying that that will happen in this calendar year, but that should be the bias over a period of time.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. First kind of keeping on the hard disk drive business, I know you talked about it in the press release or the slide deck, a 100% plus growth year-over-year in nearline HDD capacity shipments. But given the competitive landscape and the questions, I'm curious, what did that – how did that perform on a sequential basis and how are you currently seeing the competitive environment?
Steve Milligan: Yes, so I think in general, we maintain our leading market share position, call it in the kind of low to mid-50s. We'll see where this all settles out once everybody reports. We expect that to continue right through the first half of this calendar year. And then in the back half, we obviously think we have some opportunity to continue to grow slightly. So from a product positioning standpoint, we feel very good about not only our 2014, which continues to be the highest volume shipper, but the expected ramp of our 16, 18, and 20 which will occur throughout the year. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will begin initial revenue shipments in the current quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then on the gross margin on the flash side, mix can be a meaningful driver to gross margin. But I'm curious as you continue to execute on BiCS, I guess, it'd be BiCS4 and now we start to talk about BiCS5. Can you just update us on how we think about the cost curve relative to that mix shift effect to kind of take you back to that as you said, 35% to 40% gross margin? And just where are we at currently in the mix of BiCS4 in terms of bits shipped right now?
Mike Cordano: Yes, BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of bits. We’re just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp. The way to think about Aaron, though, is really in this kind of 15% plus or minus annualized cost take down, and certainly we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition. Relative to mix, I would say both product and market segment exposure and then of course the broader ASP pricing environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two follow-ups for Mike and Steve. First on the NAND side and on the game console rather new game console, and this is incremental as I imagine the prior generations are hard disk drive base and now is moving to SSDs. And there are some figures out there. I’m just wanted to see, what is your assumption for the kind of NAND supply that the new game console is going to consume, given the fact that this is incremental. And I have a follow-up.
Mike Cordano: Yes, I think you’re right. It is all incremental. And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our standpoint, because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year, on the hard drive side. I don’t think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks, this is going to be a large multi-exabyte market and we wouldn’t want to comment any more specifically.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, fair. Moving on to hard disk drive, obviously, you’re introducing a new 18 terabyte. Can you help me understand how you’re cost competitive? I understand, your product has a fewer number of plates and as we migrate from 16 to 18. How that cost competitiveness is going to be used to increase market share.
Mike Cordano: Yes. So I think from our standpoint, we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 and 20. And so the platter count to our understanding is, distance with next generation. So our benefit relative to market share is always about bringing the right products in the market in a leading way, getting smoothly through customer qualification and ramping quickly. We’ve been doing that generation over generation for several years. We will do that again on the 18, 16 and 20-terabyte product that we’ll be ramping this year.
Steve Milligan: And we – and Mehdi, we do have a cost advantage and we would think that, I mean, that’s represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance. And one of the things that you’re alluding to is that, our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for the 16, 18 and 20-terabyte drives that we are using aluminum media versus glass media and that is a lower cost?
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two, if I may. First question is regarding your NAND supply outlook and you were calling for 30% growth for the industry in calendar 2020. Is most of that coming from process conversions and what sitting an inventory? Or is it going to be dictated by adding substantial Greenfield capacity at the K1 facility? And in addition to that, your South Korean peer last night spoke about NAND demand – industry NAND demand growing kind of high-20s for 2020. How does that play into your capital planning process?
Steve Milligan: Yes. Hey, Karl, one thing I want to comment is, when they were talking about high 20%, I believe that was supply growth, not demand growth. So, but anyway, I’ll let Mike comment on the specifics.
Mike Cordano: Yes. So all the growth, both ours and the industry is technology transition. So our K1 expansion is all about technology – room for technology transition. There is no way for capacity in our plans going in. And that’s really it, I think that – across the industry. And just to comment further on where we think, we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth, Steve commented on what Samsung’s comments were. We believe demand growth will be in the 35% plus range this year.
Steve Milligan: Hence, the shortage.
Karl Ackerman: Very helpful. Last one, if I may. Your enterprise SSD market share opportunity is quite significant and I think impressive. But when we think about that – how much of that is driven by a new server architecture launch this year versus retrofitting existing servers? And I asked because a Tier 1 U.S. based hyperscale are just announced after the close that depreciation will be lower for them in March due to an increase in useful life of their server. So if I could just kind of talk about that a little bit, that’d be great. Thank you.
Mike Cordano: Yes. So no, we’re not dependent on any specific server transition. So what we’re able to do with our NVMe products is when both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space. And then of course, similarly in SaaS, there’ll be a series of new products announced, where we will be designed. And so we’re not dependent on any particular server transition and it’s really the power of and strength for the product portfolio as well as the customer’s view of us as a preferred supplier that’s driving that share growth.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Mike Cordano: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long: Thank you. Just going back – two for me as well. On the HDD side, can you just talk a little bit about as 16, 18 and 20 ramp through the year just for your nearline business? What do you think the gross margin in ASP impacts will be there? And then on the NAND side, there was early comment, you talked a little bit about mix. Could you just give us a sense as to the dilution from mobile? And should we expect more or less participation in that market as we move through calendar 2020. Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Yes. Tim, this is Bob. So the first one on the hard drive, and we have not been giving specifics on capacity enterprise margins, but they are better than average. And as we’ve said before, as our mix trends towards more and more across the enterprise, we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up into the mid-30% range. So that’ll be a benefit to us. And from – on the mix question, I mean, we’re not – also not able to get specific, in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was that mobile, but it obviously was a dilutive to us this quarter. And over time, we’ll always participate some in the mobile market, but we’ll continue to manage that.
Steve Milligan: Yes. And I add the flash supply demand situation tightens up, we will see the mobile market become more attractive for us from a gross margin perspective.
Tim Long: Okay. Good point. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the planning process behind the CapEx at the JV level on NAND. To the extent that you guys are feeling better about the business and where profitability is going. Do you feel the need to change CapEx at the JV? And then I guess, sort of second half of that question, you said earlier that – earlier in the year that you can sort of get the industry big growth without a lot of CapEx, because you won’t have the fab shut down, you won’t have the power outage. Can you just update us on your thinking of how that impacts your supply growth for the calendar year?
Steve Milligan: Yes. I’ll comment overall on the CapEx in terms of that growth and that sort of thing. I mean, from an overall philosophical perspective, I mean, we want to be adding a bid supply to the market that is consistent largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective. So we’re not – as a result of an improving environment, we’re not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plans. But over a longer period of time, we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth and demand. And so that hasn’t changed.
Joe Moore: Great., thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.
Mitch Steves: Hey, guys. Just two questions from me. I just want to try to clarify at least get some numbers around this or any way to think about it. So when you look at the SSD opportunities, you’re just trying to double your share there for the NVMe, it’s under the statement you guys made in the slide deck. And you combine that with the gaming platforms coming in. How much of that is adding to kind of the overall demands, you guys gave a 35% number. I’m just trying to understand how much of this you guys have clean visibility on so we can get an understanding of how much that demand is gaming plus your share gains on the enterprise side.
Mike Cordano: So the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you as independent of our own share growth, right. So – and in any one of these particular segments. So our view of 35% demand side growth on the year is an aggregate across the industry per bit. While we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and in gaming that's obviously product segment related gains. So we're not going to talk specifically about that. I think you can kind of calculate where we think we're going on the enterprise SSD side given my comment.
Steve Milligan: Yes, add kind of further context to that. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to place our bits in those markets that characterize. I will call it one or two elements. One, opportunities for us to add more value from a product perspective, thereby driving higher gross margin, referring to that is, let's call it enterprise market. And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier, less volatile so that we can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market. Gaming, yes, it's incremental from a flash perspective, but it also tends to be stickier business, more predictable. And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our business in more attractive parts of the market. As opposed to, let's call it more transactional or price-driven areas of the market.
Mitch Steves: Got it. Understood. And then just last one, you guys have mentioned like 40% kind of NAND gross margin is kind of the goal you guys want to get to, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how that ramps, is that something you guys think you can exit at in calendar year or is it going to take a lot longer than that? Just looking for any sort of help, when you guys think you can get to the kind of 40% number you've talked to in the past?
Steve Milligan: Well, what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing out in calendar year, we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the year. Now that's not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4 wants to see exactly how the market evolves. But we clearly continue to believe that 40% range is the right level for us and we believe that we'll begin to approach that, I mean in the back half of the calendar year.
Mitch Steves: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about industry bit supply growth in the low-30s and you would be in line with that. Can you share with us what you expect to revenue on a bit basis? And as part of your thinking there, how are you contemplating bits for mobility versus elsewhere?
Bob Eulau: Well, the one thing I'd say relative, we don't comment specifically, but we would expect to have our own inventory positions in quite balanced state. We are entering the year and we expect it to be exiting the calendar year. So to the extent you want to calculate that, that will give you a feel for it.
C.J. Muse: Okay. And you're thinking on the mobility side, is that something that, you’re thinking maybe on the – you'll stick more to enterprise and consoles?
Bob Eulau: No. The mobility side is not all equal. And part of our effort over the last several years is getting more product diversification, as Steve talked about some of the newer areas. But we will continue to maintain exposure to mobility. We will just manage that exposure and make sure we're making or we're able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve. So we see it as a long-term area of investment.  We'd see there are some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace. So we'll continue to be investing there. We'll just be able to manage our bid allocation more broadly through this calendar year and into the future.
C.J. Muse: Excellent. And as my follow-up, another question on the NAND gross margins, shocking. But if you could I guess speak to the K1 charges, when you think they might roll-off and how accretive that might be? And also given kind of the state of the industry today, are you running 100% utilization and what kind of tailwind do you see there? Thank you.
Mike Cordano: Yes. So in terms of K1, I mean, we're now having real production runs and we'll continue to have more production as we progress through the year, that this last quarter we didn't have quite as larger charges we thought we were going to, I think it came in around 65 million and I think we had said on this call last quarter would be around 75 million. In the current quarter, in the March quarter, we're expecting around 70 million in terms of a period expense charge. And that should start to go down after this quarter. And it's really a function of how we ramp production and obviously ability to absorb those costs, but it'll start to get better I think from here.
Bob Eulau: Yes. And one thing just to comment on when I talked about 35% to 40% flash gross margins in the back half of the calendar year, that is inclusive of any potential startup costs that would still remain in the back half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS. 
Munjal Shah: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, two questions. One, could you just update us on the CEO search and then secondly on HDD exabyte, they were down 1% sequentially, but then you talk about 100% growth on exabyte basis on year-on-year, so if you could pie those two as to why on a sequential basis exabyte would be down? And related to near line, what's the visibility into 2020?
Steve Milligan: Yes. So I'll take the CEO search comment or a question, and then Mike can comment on capacity enterprise. So regarding the search, the search process is ongoing. And one of the things that I will add to that is the board is very pleased with the progress that they're making today. And so that's all the update we have for now.
Mike Cordano: And relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace, our fiscal quarter one was a record a shipment for us. Our exabyte share was around 57%. We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind of leading share position in this space, so some of that would be as little bit of a share drop. And I talked about that 53% to 55% depending on where things settle out. But as we looked into the first half of this calendar year, we see demand across the breadth of the market remaining fairly strong. And we think we're in a good position to maintain this leading market share position that I just talked about. So visibility is good. Obviously different customers have different plans, but when we aggregate it, we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength and demand through the first half of the calendar year.
Munjal Shah: Yes, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions from me, first of all, you mentioned that you became supply constraint on the NVMe SSDs during the quarter. Can you just sort of talk about how you work that through and what it implies for future growth, maybe this quarter, next quarter? And then secondly, I was wondering if you could expand on your comment about the pockets of tightness you're currently seeing, what exactly would you call out, I guess besides the enterprise, but anything you can elaborate on there and where maybe it those pockets expand to in the coming quarter? Thank you.
Mike Cordano: Yes. So I'll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint. It was not a flash supply constraint issue, basically what happened is the demand was better than we had expected and it was some of the components that we use in our NVMe SSD product. We've worked to resolve those and it should not be an issue as we move forward through calendar 2020. And then the other question?
Steve Milligan: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is, in general demand has been very strong across fine SSD, really in the performance categories. So in some parts of the world there are some constraints there and that's being shown – that’s being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction.
Steven Fox: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the sharp growth in the enterprise, in the NVMe SSD platforms, given the strong momentum on these products and the strong cloud spending environment. Do you think that you guys actually exited the calendar year tracking at low-double digits percentage market share or are we still somewhat constrained on the supply exiting the year?
Mike Cordano: Yes. To Steve's comment, we actually saw a demand in excess of our availability of the actual other components. So had we been able to fully realize that? Frankly we had been in the low-double digits on share. That remedies itself as we're now inside lead time. We continue to see strong demand for those products. And as I talked about, we expect to double revenue in that category year-over-year.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks. And on the HDD side, on the outlook for capacity enterprise exabyte shipments up kind of 35% year-over-year this year, it seems a bit conservative. I mean we're hearing that it's more likely in the mid-40% range or with 60% type year-over-year growth in the first half of this year, just given the continued strong cloud spending trends. So wondering if you can kind of layout your assumptions maybe here in the first half of the year for exabyte consumption just given that cloud and hyperscale spending still seems to be quite strong.
Mike Cordano: Yes, we haven’t been too specific on that. I will say, I will give you a comment that we do see at this time a bias up in demand. So I think that’s reflected in your comments. So, relative to a 35% or so annual expectation, I think our current view is a bias up from there.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Hi, thanks guys for taking the question. Congratulations on a solid performance and it’s good to see the guide you’re really amplifying here. I’ll just stick with nearline Steve; could you just give us a little more context about how you see the aesthetic? And then Mike as well of the cloud cycle through the year, Mike it sounds like you’re saying you expected through the balance of calendar year 2020 now to some extent. Steve or Mike, do you see it potentially continuing? Is this a potential, I’m not asking for a guide, but the potential to continue exabyte demand going up sort of into the back half of the year, is this sort of one where it gets up to a peak sooner, but then maybe is sort of an extended kind of cycle. Any context there would be great. Appreciate it.
Mike Cordano: Let me try to clarify a little bit. We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong. I’ll reference back to the comments I just made. On an annualized basis, we’ve been talking about 35% annualized growth. We do see on an annualized basis a bias up from there. I wouldn’t want to comment kind of any further on, the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarters look.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. That’s helpful. I appreciate that clarification. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just to follow up on the previous questions, Steve. I guess, we’ve had pretty strong two quarters from the cloud end market here and there’s some concern that there may be a digestion period as you ahead into the first half. And I think Intel did say that, they expect somewhat of a digestion period. I’m just wondering, you tend to have pretty long visibility, especially on the drive side. I’m just wondering if you’re seeing any signs of slowdown out there that causes these to kind of, believe that there’s going to be a digestion period.
Steve Milligan: Yes. So again, all customers not created equal. There are some that are doing that, but when we aggregate it, the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, guys. I’m just wondering, I saw your CapEx is down for fiscal 2020, keeping the discipline. I just wondering, I should look at the rest of the ecosystem. Are you seeing any aggressive CapEx, or how do you view that? And also on the China side with YMTC as it continue to expand, what are your thoughts in terms of supply coming in with increased or aggressive CapEx given how NAND pricing has been trending? Thanks.
Steve Milligan: Yes. I will comment in terms of overall industry, the extent that there’s public information. But as Samsung indicated and others have indicated, we’re all circling at a bit supply growth rate that’s kind of in a similar neighborhood. With Samsung talking about high 20% – 20% growth rate and we’re talking low or mid – in low 30s. And so, we’re kind of all aggregating and we’re not seeing anybody adding capacity from a NAND supply perspective that would concern us, certainly not on the short term because it would take up to 18 months for that to become productive capacity. And so, we’re not seeing anybody behave in a way that we think that would upset the balance from a supply demand perspective. So we feel pretty good about that. YMTC, no real change in terms of our expectations there. We do not see them having any material impact in terms of the market for the next several years. And we’ll continue to evaluate that depending upon their ability to ramp, not only from a pure production standpoint, but from a technology perspective. But certainly no concerns I would say over the next two to three years in that regard. And that’s kind of within the planning cycle that we would have visibility to.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Great, thank you. The question is if you can look at your calendar Q1 guide being roughly flat quarter-by-quarter, which seems to be better than seasonal, especially on the NAND side. Can you talk about your expectations made by products hard-drive versus SLC drives or by segment? I’m just curious how much of that above seasonal goal is a function of ASP improvement for NAND?
Steve Milligan: So let me, I’ll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more specifics. But I mean, if you look at first thing, I’m going to answer it and kind of a backdoor sort of way. If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, which is pretty significant in terms of 25.9 to 28.5 to 29.5 in terms of the range, almost all of that is driven by improving flash environment. So namely pricing, all right. And so, and yes, there’s mix improvements and that sort of thing. And so that directly impacts revenue. So when you look at an improving pricing environment that’s helping us to keep our revenues, let’s call it flattish on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then beyond that, we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid. I mean, just kind of solid, not great, not necessarily, but not bad. And so it’s just kind of there and that’s both a flash and a hard drive statement. And so that’s allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality drop in revenue in calendar Q1. So are really kind of the two big factors.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you. And great to see the accelerated NAND flash recovery in the gross margins. I did want to make sure I understand the dynamic that is going on there. Do you expect your own NAND flash inventory to decline Q-on-Q for the March quarter which I think as Micron has commented; they were expecting their NAND flash inventory to accumulate. But for NAND flash prices to increase. So I’m just wondering if you had some color there as far as your expectations on that.
Bob Eulau: Yes, this is Bob. I can make a couple of comments and I don’t want to start giving guidance for inventory by quarter. But we’re still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we saw this quarter. And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least five turns. And that’s what we’re focused on internally as a company. So it’ll – it won’t be strictly linear getting there, but we think we can achieve that fairly soon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to some of the questions about your 18, 20 gigabit drive and terabyte drives that have been released. Can you discuss how the gross margin acceleration or the TAC-2, your target gross margin is impacted by your ability to get those out sooner in terms of the development of those drives? You talked about I think the last quarter the nine-platter was pulled in somewhat in terms of development. How does that help in the acceleration of the gross margin progression?
Bob Eulau: Yes, this is Bob. I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of capacity enterprise. And as I said earlier, is our mix tends more and more toward capacity enterprise that’ll pull up our overall hard drive mix. Our mix was not as good as prior quarters, this past quarter, but you still saw the margin improvement. You saw that ASP stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix. So overall I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise and I think as we introduced a new product, that trend will continue.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark, before we end with a short statement by our CEO.
Mark Miller: Thank you. But I believe the questions I wanted to address about the second half strength in data center and also nearline have been posed. So, I don’t need to posed those again.
Steve Milligan: Hey Mark, good to hear your voice.
Steve Milligan: All right. So thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. Have a good rest of the day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-10-31 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter of Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew. Please go ahead, sir.
Peter Andrew: Okay. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations business plans trends and financial outlook. Based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements, please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.
Steve Milligan: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau Chief Financial Officer.Before we discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I want to spend a moment talking about the other news we announced today, after a long and fulfilling career with Western Digital spanning two decades. I have informed our Board that I plan to retire as CEO. I will continue to serve as CEO until the Board has identified and appointed a successor.Western Digital as a significantly different company than the one I first joined in 2002. We are more diversified, more resilient and much better positioned to capture the opportunities of today's evolving data marketplace.Since my appointment as CEO western Digital has transformed from a storage component provider to a diversified, enabler of data infrastructure with the broadest portfolio in the industry, offering customers a powerful combination of hard drive storage and flash memory products.We have successfully executed many key strategic initiatives including the company's acquisition of SanDisk, the integration of Western Digital, HGST and SanDisk as well as the extension and Western Digital's 19-year partnership with Kioxia. We now operate a powerful platform that uniquely positions us to provide new architectures and capabilities to manage the volume velocity and variety of data.As we think about what comes next for our company. I believe now is the right time for Western Digital to begin the transition to its next phase of leadership. Serving as Western Digital CEO for the past 7 years has truly been one of the highlights of my career; I want to thank our team for their support and dedication.I could not be prouder of what we have accomplished together and consider myself quite fortunate to have worked alongside such a talented team. In terms of next steps I look forward to continuing to work closely with the team. While the Board conducts to search for our next CEO.Given our strong management team, we expect this transition to be seamless. For our shareholders, our employees and the customers that rely on our best-in-class service and products. Once my successor is on board, I will remain with the company in an advisory role until September 2020 to ensure a smooth transition. I will also continue to serve as a Director on the Western Digital Board for a transition period after my successor is appointed.With that said, let me turn to our performance for this quarter. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start. Revenue exceeded the guidance range we provided in July, in non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. The upside was driven primarily by the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data center.We are executing well on the Data Center utilizing the power of our portfolio. At the core of our success in this market is our industry-leading capacity enterprise hard drive solutions and the exceptional value we provide to our data center customers for their diverse storage needs.During the quarter, we made two important announcements to further extend our product leadership. First, we introduced 16 and 18 terabyte CMR drives and 20 terabyte SMR drive all enabled by our energy assisted recording technology, these drives are expected the sample this quarter.Additionally, through our continued investments in heads, media and mechanical design. We began shipping an air based 10 terabyte drive providing significant benefits to our customers.I am pleased to announce we commenced the initial revenue ramp of our MBME based enterprise SSDs to major hyper-scale and OEM customers during the September quarter. Efforts to qualify and ramp additional customers with our next generation products based on our 96 layer 3D flash technology are going well and should position us to further increase our participation in this important market.Western Digital's ability to offer both hard drives and flash flash-based solutions differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to more strategically partner with our data center customers. Outside the data center the overall demand environment across the consumer, mobile, PC and retail end markets is solid.Furthermore, we are seeing improving trends across our flash product portfolio and continue to believe that the flash industry has passed a cyclical trough. With the broad and growing product portfolio western Digital remains well positioned to benefit from the long-term drivers of the growth in value of data.With that I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Mike Cordano: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement. I value and appreciate the partnership we have built together over the past decade and want to acknowledge Steve for his leadership and numerous contributions to Western Digital.We have quite a bit of time and work to do between now and September of next year and look forward to working together to execute on our plans. As Steve mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a good start.We had record hard drive exabyte shipments driven by the success of our capacity enterprise drive family. We also had record exabyte shipments in the flash as we benefited from demand elasticity in share gains and SSDs for PCs and notebooks.In Data Center Devices and Solutions our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth was over 60% year-over-year, led by the ramp of our 14 terabyte drives. These drives now represent the majority of our capacity enterprise unit and exabyte shipments. Industry analysts expect the 14 terabyte capacity point to be the industry's highest volume product through the first half of calendar year 2020.Building on our aerial density leadership and execution on mechanical design, we announced our plan to accelerate the introduction of our 9 platter energy assisted capacity enterprise drive platform.This enables us to ship 16 and 18 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives on a unified platform, simplifying the qualification process and reducing the time to market for our customers.We will be sampling all of these drives by the end of this quarter and we will commence volume shipments in the first half of calendar 2020. In addition, we began shipping a new 10 terabyte air-based product powered by our innovative air flow architecture, underscoring our aerial density and mechanical design leadership.Given the strength of our capacity enterprise portfolio and the opportunities we see in this market. We now believe our exabyte shipment growth will exceed 40% in calendar year 2019, up from our prior estimate of 30%. In enterprise SSDs our NDME based products experienced a strong quarter of growth and we expect continued growth in the December quarter.We are qualifying our next generation 96 layer product with additional customers, which positions us for further market share gains in calendar year 2020 and beyond.We have a unique and sustainable competitive advantage within the data center built on strong customer relationships and a strong product portfolio. Our strategic position within this important end market will drive future revenue growth.In Client Solutions revenue grew on a sequential basis, driven by an improving pricing environment and a seasonal increase in bit shipments. This quarter we began shipping 96 layer QLC based retail products and external SSDs.The Trust and reputation of our brand and our customers preference for the performance and reliability of our solutions are key differentiators. In Client Devices the main contributor to our year-over-year decline was our decision to limit our participation in the mobile market.On a sequential basis, we expect to ship more bits into the mobile market in the December quarter. In PCs and notebooks, we gained market share and client SSDs as our exabytes shipment growth exceeded 70% year-over-year.Our bit production of 96 BiCS4 surpassed 64 BiCS3 during the September quarter. We are on track to commercialize BiCS4 across all our product lines by the end of calendar 2019. Our JV partner K1 fab and Western Digital executed well bringing the Yokkaichi fabs back to full production after the power outage limiting output reduction four exabytes.Our flash supply is tight and we continue to believe that any excess inventory in the flash industry supply chain will be substantially reduced by the end of calendar 2019. We expect flash industry supply bit growth to be in the mid 20% range in calendar 2019. And in the low 30% range in calendar 2020.In addition to continued growth in our existing flash portfolio and capacity enterprise markets, we see several new incremental growth opportunities. First, the launch of the next generation gaming consoles will be important events for the gaming industry and our flash business, we expect these new console to utilize high capacity flash storage to improve the gaming experience.Second, we expect to expand our product portfolio and diversify our customer base for the mobile market with our UFS, eMMC and custom solutions. Finally our recent announcements of 3D flash products for the automotive and industrial markets will further expand our opportunities in these growing and more stable flash-based markets.I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, Mike. I also want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement and look forward to helping to enable a seamless transition to the next CEO. I'm pleased to announce the revenue for the September quarter exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided in July and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the high end of the range.Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. This was up 11% sequentially as we experienced growth in Data Center Devices and Solutions and client Solutions. Revenue was down 20% year-over-year as we faced a tough compare tough comparable quarter in fiscal 2019, by end-markets Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 20% sequentially and 6% year-over-year due to the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data centers.Please recall that a year ago based on discussions with our customers we predicted that in the second half of calendar 2019. We would return to growth in capacity enterprise. We are experiencing that predicted rebound now. On a sequential basis client solutions revenue grew 18% on seasonally stronger flash bit shipments and a stronger flash pricing environment.Client Solutions revenue declined 4% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in hard drive TAM. Client Devices revenue was up 1% on a sequential basis and decreased 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was a result of our decision to scale back flash bit shipments to the mobile market, flash price declines and a reduction in the hard drive TAM.By product category, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 36% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were flat and bit shipments were up 9% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year, average price per hard drive was $81. Exabyte shipments were up 23% sequentially, hitting a new record level.As we move on to costs and expenses; please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the September quarter was 24.8% with a flash gross margin of 19.3% and our hard drive gross margin of 28.5%. We completed all of our cost of revenue reduction activities we outlined in January, resulting in a decrease of more than $100 million in quarterly spending.The hard drive gross margin was up slightly from the June quarter and we expect the December quarter gross margin to be approximately 30% as we fully realize the benefits of the cost reduction efforts.Flash, gross margin was up on a sequential basis as we benefited from a better flash pricing environment. K1 fab cost was $64 million higher than expected. Excluded from the cost of revenue was a $68 million charge related to the power outage.Operating expenses were $767 million. Adjusting for a normal 13 week quarter operating expenses were below the $740 million run rate target. During the quarter we completed all of our operating expense reduction efforts announced in January.In addition, once we complete the exit of our storage systems business, we should start to see an approximately $25 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses beginning in the March quarter.Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $253 million and free cash flow was $294 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were inflow of $41 million.As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds flowing back and forth between us and the joint venture. From a full fiscal year, we continue to expect capital expenditures that will flow through our cash flow statement to be under $500 million.Total capital expenditures, which include our portion of joint venture leasing and self operating funding is expected to be similar to last fiscal year between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In the September quarter, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders. We paid down debt by $319 million which included an optional $250 million debt pay down. As our cash generation continues to improve.Our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After paying our dividend our next priority will be to reduce our debt. At the end of the quarter we have $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, our $2.25 billion revolver remains unused and our gross debt outstanding was $10.4 billion.Total inventory dollars were flat on a sequential basis, but higher than projected as a joint venture fab recovered faster than expected. This resulted in a sequential increase in flash inventory, particularly at the end of the quarter while hard drive inventory declined about $100 million sequentially.Moving on [Technical Difficulty] with the guidance. So again this is non-GAAP guidance and as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 25% to 26%. Please note that this range includes approximately $75 million in costs associated with the K1 fab.Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million above the $748 million run rate target due to higher variable compensation spending. We expect interest and other expense of $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be 26% plus or minus 2 points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.45 and $0.65 assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares.With that I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And Steve, congrats on the retirement has been great working with you. Two questions if I can, real quick. So first of all I guess one of the things that stands out a little bit is the capacity shipment number on flash up only about 9% sequential. By my math that's up maybe high single digits on a year-over-year basis.So can you talk a little bit about, it seems like the product portfolio is in a great position and ramping client SSD, capacity shipments were strong. I'm just curious of why we, it seems to be a little bit muted. As far as the capacity shipment trends and flash. And what's your expectation going into the December quarter for capacity ship?
Mike Cordano: So Aaron, let me address that. So the primary reason for that is really the point that I made and Bob made in our comments is we did not participate in a substantial way in the mobile marketplace in the quarter just completed. So that's the primary driver of bit shipment in the quarter.
Steve Milligan: And Aaron, recall - this is Steve. Recall, that that lack of participation in the mobile market was by choice. From our standpoint given that the profitability levels for that segment of the market, we're not at all attractive.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. And then as a second question on near capacity enterprise drives in the slide deck. You know that you now expect the overall the market to quote unquote approach 30% year-over-year growth. I think last quarter you talked about growth meaningfully exceeding that 30% level. I know you guys are talking about north of 40% growth in your capacity shipments.But what's changed over the last quarter, is there have been a bit of a softening in terms of your expectation. I guess, going into the December quarter. What's really driving that change of growth expectations?
Mike Cordano: So, Aaron I think for us, we actually updated our performance on the year. We originally had stated last quarter, we'd be north of 30% for us. We updated that guidance north of 40. We're actually seeing strength in exabyte consumption across the capacity enterprise segment.Now the other thing that's happening for us is more unique is the power of the 14 terabyte product is doing quite well. And obviously we are gaining market share in that segment that's showing up on an exabyte basis.
Aaron Rakers: It is under constraints in the market, which is tempering the overall market, the industry expectation?
Steve Milligan: No, I think we would suggest the industry will grow at north of 30, we will grow at north of 40 and again that's all up from our last outlook on both numbers.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. And Steve good luck with your next endeavor and was very nice working with you. Moving on to questions. Just to follow up. It's very helpful when you talk about exabyte shipment guide, especially for the near-line and as you look into the next year, how do you see that exabyte shipment target changing and again this is for 2020 versus 2019 and how should we think about the mix of the near line exabyte as a percentage of the overall exabyte shipment for Western Digital.
Mike Cordano: Yeah, so let me just comment specifically capacity enterprise. We would expect for 2020, our current outlook is about 35% year-over-year growth. So continued strength year-over-year and so we don't split out total HDD exabyte growth, we don't specify them.
Steve Milligan: And by the way many then 35% is consistent with our longer term expectations.
Mike Cordano: Sure. You kind of pre-into my prepared question as by saying that you didn't participate in the mobile segment as it relates to your NAND shipment and there is a debate as to what happens to that inventory in the channel reserved mobiles segment, as you look into the March quarter.So with that as the background, how do you see the supply and demand in NAND looking into the March quarter and I'm not asking for a guide. I just want to better understand your view you didn't participate in the market and in that context, how do you see your prices trending into March quarter.
Steve Milligan: Yeah. So we'll take that maybe we first off, as we indicated, we believe that we passed the trough in terms of the flash cycle. In the overall inventory situation is improving and other words supply is getting much more aligned to demand, and we would expect that largely for ourselves and for the industry as we exit the December quarter that things will be fairly imbalanced now when you move into the March quarter.And let me actually broaden that question a bit, when you move into the first half of the year. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that we will see a typical seasonal decline in terms of from a demand perspective. Supply is relatively linear.And so we will have to just like we do largely every year in terms of the calendar cyclicality, we'll have to manage through that, but then as we move to the back half of the year where we will see.And this is the back half of calendar year a calendar year 20, we will see that begin to flip demand will begin to improve and we will see rather than modest improvement in our financial results that we've been saying, we should see an accelerating improvement in our performance from a financial perspective, as we move into the back half of calendar 2020.
Mike Cordano: Mehdi, I will just give you some numbers to work with there. We talked about low '30s on supply bit growth. We would expect demand for the calendar year to be slightly above that.
Mike Cordano: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. And Steve again congrats on your retirement and best of luck in your future endeavors. Two questions if I may. Taking mobile for a moment, you referenced that mobile margins have not been attractive for the last two quarters but is that because you don't have captive DRAM.I guess, how important is that, is it for you to have either captive DRAM or a new long-term supply agreement for DRAM and you contemplate your competitive position in smart phones over time.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, let me answer that. So let me delineate mobile. So there is the discrete and component part of mobile and then there is the MCP which includes DRAM. I think, strategically, we do not see MCP is a long-term strategic place for us to operate. We're focusing our…
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Speaker?
Steve Milligan: Yes. Sorry, can you hear us now?
Operator: Yes, we can.
Steve Milligan: Okay, let me back up and repeat that. I don't know where we dropped off. Our mobile market participation let me break into two components. One is the MCP business that includes DRAM, the second is discrete and component participation in mobile end-use applications.Strategically we've moved away from product investment in MCP and over the longer horizon. It's not an area of product focus for us. So when we talk about participation is that, for us the discrete business which we chose for economic reasons to minimize our participation as we had higher value places to put our bets. So we see that sequentially improving and the economics in mobile improving along with other segments of the market.
Karl Ackerman: That's helpful, Mike. As my follow-up shifting gears to gross margins for a moment. Clearly you and your peers are operating well below normalized run rates in NAND. At the same time so I think your outlook for hard drive gross margins are good. But still a little bit below where we were roughly a year ago.I guess we'll be exit of the systems business or areas of the systems business be the primary driver for gross margin improvement in hard drives, and I guess how do we think about the margin implications from the incremental disk and heads on those higher capacity drives. Thank you.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so I'll address that. And then Bob and Mike can join in and add any additional color. So the first thing is the exiting in the system business will have no material impact one way or the other on our gross margins. So if you look at our hard drive gross margins. I mean, let's be clear about that. Our hard drive gross margins, although good levels are not where we want them to be.We want those hard drive gross margins to be north of 30% in the low 30% range. We are still dealing with some of the cost overhang of exiting our [indiscernible] manufacturing facility. That is now behind us. And so we should see our drive margins improve into that low 30% range as we exit this the December quarter and then obviously, our intent is to sustain and possibly improve that over a period of time.Flash, gross margins are clearly not where we want them to be. They are improving albeit at a slow rate. We would continue to expect as we see this sort of ripple through the market because different customers started at different levels, different market started at different levels.The pace of that improvement is not linear for all of those aspects. But we'll continue to see steady improvement in our flash margins this quarter and then into subsequent quarters. And as I indicated earlier, we expect that improvement to improve at a improved rate at a better rate as we move into the second half of calendar 2020.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I have follow ups around gross margins and maybe versus to better understand the outlook for NAND and that it get the guiding for margins to improve somewhat, next quarter. You sort of understand around ASPs on a like-for-like basis, if you can give more color on what you're assuming there given the comments about a cyclical bottom?
Steve Milligan: Yeah, I can start. And first of all, I want to remind you on the NAND side. We do have a headwind with the K1 startup costs and bringing up that fab and we are beginning production there. But there is probably in the neighborhood of 3.0 headwinds that we're faced with on the NAND side. And as we've ramped volume, then obviously the margins will improve everything else being equal.So in terms of a flash overall as we get to equilibrium between supply and demand, we're definitely expecting that the pricing will get better as we move through 20. Mike or Steve was saying. So I think it will take a little bit of time to work through that, but I think we're going to be a good price.
Mark Delaney: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then my follow-up was on the hard drive gross margin again along the lines of the prior questioning. I have been under the impression that for the December quarter, hard drive gross margins could hit 30% especially given the upside that the company has seen the near line business, which I think typically runs at least 30%, if not higher.Is there anything in terms of increased headwinds around gross margins of the company has seen in the December quarter. This maybe keeping hard drive gross margins under 30% or was kind of the wrong impression about the ability to hit 30% with my previous expectations for the December.
Steve Milligan: Let me, because I get kind of this one I feel strongly about. We will -- we are intent is to have gross margins north of 30% for our hard drive business this quarter, the December quarter. And so there is no headwind at present, of course, there can be things that will happen. But there's nothing at present that indicates that we won't hit that level.
Mike Cordano: And the other thing I would add, Marc is, if you look out over time we expect more and more growth in terms of capacity enterprise will become a bigger percentage of our overall mix and that will help the margins go up as well.
Mark Delaney: Got it. That's it, thank you very much. And Steve good luck with your future endeavors.
Steve Milligan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.
Mitch Steves: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I think on the folks a, just on the gross margin kind of the NAND inflection. I think a lot of people looking for kind of like $0.80 or even $1 for in December quarter guide you the improving memory environment.So I guess maybe can you help us at least understand how you guys think at the inflection in terms of how much leverage, you're going to get on the gross margin side, if we look out, let's say 3 or 4 quarters. And I'm trying to understand the comment about how you're going to see a more material inflection in the back half for calendar '20?
Steve Milligan: So a couple of things. Let me talk about the dynamics in the current period. We talked about. So when we look at where we started from all end markets in flash were not created equal relative to pricing and margin. We also noted that mobile was a inferior performing segment for us. We are taking more of that on this quarter, as a percentage of the total. So that is having a bit of a headwind, relative to the flash margin in the current quarter.To Steve's comments earlier on 2020 we see supply demand in pretty good shape as we come into 2020. But the normal seasonality of the year we got to make sure we're managing through that in a cautious way and we expect that is a year moves on. As we head towards the middle of the year in the back end that will continue to improve in the rate of margin improvement in flash will accelerate in the back half of the year.
Mitch Steves: Okay. And then in terms of the NAND gross margin is that go back to like '30s in the back half of 20. I mean, just any sort of rough metric would be helpful?
Steve Milligan: Well, we are, I mean, let me be clear on this we're not providing guidance beyond what we've done in terms of flash gross margins. But I'll tell you where we need to get to and where we want to get to is back to where flash gross margins are in that 40% range.That that's a margin level that we view as attainable over a period of time and it's also a margin level that we believe is required to get sufficient return on the capital that we are investing in this business. So that's where we want to head to.
Mitch Steves: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.
CJ Muse: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins. Specific to the NAND side, can you quantify the K1 fab costs in the September quarter. I think you said $75 million in the December quarter and how we should think about that progressing into 2020. And then I guess as a second question there on the flash bit side, it looks like implied in there. Given these costs roughly bit growth of only 10% or so in the quarter.So it looks like you're really growing about 19%, 20% for the year versus many of your competitors who are suggesting low '30s for the industry and so I guess is that a function of just deciding not to want to play in the mobility side, is it a function of not having the right bids or is there something else. Thank you.
Steve Milligan: Now, let me, let me address the last question first. In terms of us growing and first off, the big growth that we're seeing from a demand of revenue perspective is consistent with previous expectations. It hasn't changed and by the way, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that we took a meaningful amount of production offline starting earlier this year. Independent of the power outage because we saw the oversupply conditions well, we saw it coming.And we saw that situation being let's just call it untenable and so we were reducing our bit output from a supply perspective to help offset that growth that unnecessary growth from a supply perspective that created the substantial price decline that we in the industry realized in the back half of ' 18 and also into 2019.
Mike Cordano: So I ask Bob to address. So CJ in terms of the September quarter that we just finished the K1 costs were at $64 million and what I said in the guidance as we expect in the December quarter. That will be in the neighborhood of $75 million. We think they will start to come down from that point in time. But this is, I mean this is new production capacity we're putting in place, it becomes a part of our fixed cost over time.
Bob Eulau: Yeah C.J one other comment I'll make is when you think about this on a bit share comparative basis when you think about it from a bit capacity output basis. Obviously, we continue to remain in the same proximity a ratio to others. So this was simply us choosing to not produce very low margin product for the as reasons [indiscernible]
CJ Muse: It makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Excuse me. Good afternoon and sorry for another gross margin question, but maybe…
Steve Milligan: We have to start banning gross margin question.
Steven Fox: Yeah, I know last one. Let me get this in. So in terms of just the mix impact on NAND gross margins, can you maybe talk a little bit about what's going on, how mix is affecting the gross margin guidance for the current quarter versus what you just reported NAND gross margins and then along similar lines, you mentioned some incremental growth next year from things like next generation gaming and industrial.Can you talk about their mix impact on gross margins? And if I did I get it in one more given what you said about the first half of the calendar year, are you able to at least hold gross margins around current levels or based on what you do with where you choose to put your bids or do we backtrack a little? Thank you.
Bob Eulau: Well I'm going to address the last question first. We would expect that our profitability levels certainly from a margin percentage standpoint will continue to modestly improve as we move into the first half of the year.
Mike Cordano: Okay. And back to the mix. Let me just reiterate within the flash business, we're taking on a greater proportion mobile business this quarter, which is a margin drag and is dampening our sequential margin performance, to some degree. On the flash side and then Bob also talked about the fact startup. So those two things are affecting the flash margin in this quarter.When we go into 2020 certainly a number of the new markets are good bit consumers the gaming business, we think that that is going to be not only a good consumer of bits but at reasonably attractive margins and industrial and automotive are even better yet relative to margins and more stable non-cyclical.
Steve Milligan: And yeah -- Bob already indicated that the K1 costs are kind of a 3-point drag and then if you neutralize for mix. I think that we would all be seeing a much more satisfying increase in our flash margins when you neutralize for those two items. And I think that's important for all of us to keep that in mind, the trajectory is in the right direction. It's just that there are other moving parts that tend to mask those improving trends.
Steven Fox: Got it. And Steve congrats on all your accomplishments at Western Digital. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great, thanks. Maybe one more question on this, on the flash side, I know you talk about few times about strategically walking away from the mobile mix, can you remind us your mix within the NAND flash business today and how do you think that will change a year from now. Is there more tailwinds coming from this mix change in mix, and what are the areas that have better margins of worth more than the average for the business?
Steve Milligan: So we don't specifically disclose the ratio of flash participation. But I can give you some color on relative performance, certainly the areas a big investment for us that we emphasize our own where we want to grow our participation. So enterprise SSD fast growing higher overall margins than the average over time. Industrial embedded both similarly situation in the higher margins.Good growth rates and then ultimately certain segments of mobile over time are attractive and we're focused on those. Hence our UFS product investment, so the higher end higher performance part of that marketplace. So we put a big emphasis on quality of revenue and seeking out those higher margin more stable end markets and those will be examples that we're focused on.
Sidney Ho: Great. My follow-up question; I'm sure you welcome a hard drive question. The last earnings call, you talked about introducing 16 terabyte CMR and as 18 terabyte SMR. But you ended up launching a higher capacity about two months later, can you talk about why you made that change in the roadmap and what kind of feedback are you getting from your customers so far?
Steve Milligan: Yeah. So the reason that we made that decision and it's actually quite simple is that we, we made faster progress in terms of our 9 platter platform than what we had previously anticipated. And so the advancements that we were making from a mechanical perspective allowed us to pull in that platform sooner than what we anticipated, which was favorably received by our customers from a market place perspective, which I'll ask Mike to elaborate on.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And I think a number of dimensions of this. Obviously, it gets them to 18 and 20 terabyte sooner than they would have otherwise. So the TCO benefit when you combine cost per bit with the other elements like slot tax because you know you eliminate some slots required and also the quality that we deliver with our products, the whole economic equation is better and then we talked about, we get a multi platform qualification.So for them their ability to qualify a single platform that covers all of those configurations is both a simplifying of their efforts on cost reduction of their efforts and it gets us to market earlier. So all positive trends from the customers' perspective and getting to that new 18 terabyte CMR in 20 terabyte SMR capacity earlier is a big value.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Hi, thanks guys for taking the questions. And Steve, congrats as well for me, I know we have a little more time with you, but it's certainly been, I do have a gross margin question guys. But I'm going to start with the hyperscale question just provide some the leaf here. So first a clarification, the comment earlier in the Q&A about 35% growth for calendar ' 20 year-over-year was that your hyperscale outlook for calendar ' 20 or was that another.
Steve Milligan: No, that's -- yeah that's total capacity enterprise. So hyperscale and OEM consumption of that class together.
Ananda Baruah: Thanks for that. And could you update for us. You have an updated view on what this cycle might look like this hyperscale cycle might look like. Now, I think you made some comments the last couple of quarters.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, I think the only thing we can say as we continue to see strength of the cycle. End of the first half of 20. I don't think we want to go any beyond that that supported in the 35% year over year growth parameters. So we don't see enrolling over yet. No.
Ananda Baruah: And the, any sense, if the incremental strength is pro in for this year it's been a little bit stronger than we thought is pull into this year your -- point to sustainability as we move kind of move into the March quarter.
Steve Milligan: So it would point to sustainability end of the first half of the calendar year '20.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, that's great. And then just quickly on the flash gross margin. So as we think about the different layers of the headwind that could roll off, it sounds like there is the mobile and that 300, sorry the K1 doing the basically spread, but it sounds like as you participate more mobile of the headwinds will diminish sort of incoming quarters before we get the inflection in few quarters, will the K1 cost with the 300 basis points headwind. Will that also kind of gradually roll off until we get into September quarter?And then whether the other levers that will also contribute to the gradual expansion in margin before we get into the second half of next year. I just don't want to miss anything. I want to make sure I'm understanding it appropriately. Thanks.
Steve Milligan: Yeah. So I'll start with the K1 question. So right now I mean we're just beginning production in that fab and so it will be a gradual improvement in absorption over the next few quarters and eventually it will be fully absorbed and have a cost structure. Similar to what we experienced elsewhere.
Mike Cordano: Yeah, I think the other drivers are really looking at the individual segments. And as I talked about, we are continuing to expand the product portfolio and increased participation and let's call it higher quality revenue segments like enterprise SSD and other sort of high-end mobile marketplaces as we progress into 2020. So think of it is customer and product mix improvements as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah, hi, thanks guys, congrats Steven, and good luck with your next endeavors. Just on the flash side. I was wondering going back on the gross margin, and that's the last question here, if you could look at, you said you're trying to exit the mobile segments but wondering as you look at first half, do you expect to step up as exit some of this mobile segments in what kind of margin improvement should expect on the flash side with as you move more into the SSD, or less price sensitive markets and same question is on that, sorry go ahead.
Steve Milligan: Well, I was going to respond to that. I'm sorry. But, so let me clarify. We have not exited from the mobile market, we chose not to participate in segments of that market for a period of time because the margins, it was not, it made and made no economic sense. Okay. As we see the pricing environment in that market. Begin to stabilize and improve consistent with improving supply and demand dynamics, we will be increasing our participation in that market starting this quarter.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the hard to strive side you've got talked about 16 and trade, but can you give us some color of how, when you expect to ramp some of those products as you go through 2020. Thanks.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. So obviously we said we're sampling those in the current quarter and we expect to ramp that in the first half of calendar ' 20 so that's in the not too distant future.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. Just for verification purposes here or education purposes. What is the NAND flash industry typically seasonally peak in terms of bit demand from a monthly perspective?
Steve Milligan: Well, I mean this selling a answer. It's the old adage that the best quarter of the year is October, November and December, it's around that time but I don't know, literally which month.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And so, Mike, I think you made a comment that the exabyte loss from the power outage turned out to be 4 exabyte, 6 exabytes but you still expect that the excess inventory industry wide would be flushed out by the end of this year. So given that lower exabyte loss, have you seen better demand and expected over the past three months.
Steve Milligan: So I think in general, our bit consumption of demand has been at or a well above what we thought. So our comments were we thought. By the end of the year the industry inventories would be substantially improved and we stand by that.
Nehal Chokshi: And what's been the driver of that better-than-expected demand for the NAND Flash bits?
Steve Milligan: I think we've seen generally speaking, some a little bit better mix in terms of capacity per unit. And I think some of the end markets are a little more robust than maybe we originally expected, including mobile.
Nehal Chokshi: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Speakers I'm showing no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Peter Andrew: All right. Thank you for joining us today. I would also like to extend a thank you to all of our employees, customers and business partners. We look forward to a successful year together. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-08-01 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon. Before we begin, I would like to everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook, based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.We will also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.
Steve Milligan: Thank you, Peter and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.We ended fiscal 2019 with a significantly expanded market presence in both capacity enterprise and client SSDs and began building momentum for our enterprise SSDs. The Western Digital team maintained its focus on execution, further improved operational efficiency and delivered the strongest product portfolio in the company's history. We accomplished all of this in the midst of various challenges on both the market and geopolitical fronts.In hard drives, we continue to focus on the higher growth, higher margin portion of the market, namely capacity enterprise. Our technology leadership demonstrated by our 14-terabyte drive combined with the breadth of our portfolio across a range of capacities enabled us to gain market share. In flash, we doubled our client SSD exabyte shipments due to the strength of our portfolio.I'm also pleased that our latest enterprise NVMe product is commencing its revenue ramp in the current quarter at both major hyper scale and OEM customers, positioning us for strong growth in this area in fiscal 2020 and beyond. In May, we announced a formal agreement with our flash JV partner, Toshiba Memory Corporation, to jointly invest in the K1 fab. This new facility will provide needed space for the continued transition to future 3D flash technologies.On the cost front, we accelerated the streamlining of our hard drive manufacturing footprint. We also made significant progress in lowering our operating expenses, and Bob will provide additional details. In terms of our June quarter performance, overall results were within the expectations we provided in April. In hard drives, the ongoing customer transition to our 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive drove meaningful sequential revenue growth.In flash, revenue declined sequentially as an improved product mix was more than offset by weak pricing. Our expectation for a stronger demand environment for the second half of calendar year 2019 remains intact for both our flash and hard drive products.Before I hand the call over to Mike, I want to provide some comments on three additional topics, Huawei, the Yokkaichi JV fabs and flash inventory. Effective May 16, the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security or BIS added Huawei to its entity list. Western Digital stopped shipments to Huawei at that time. After discussions with the Commerce Department on the relevant laws and regulations, we determined that the entity list regulations do not apply to products that were previously qualified for Huawei and we started resuming shipments of those products to Huawei in mid-June. Western Digital's business activities that are subject to the entity list restrictions remain on hold. But we have applied for the BIS for a license to resume those activities.Turning to the Yokkaichi fabs, an unexpected power outage occurred on June 15, affecting production operations at the flash fabrication facilities operated by TMC. Since that event, the Western Digital and TMC teams have worked diligently on recovery activities. And as of now, nearly all of the equipment in the fabs has returned to normal operations. Consistent with our prior comments, the disruption to fab operations caused a loss of approximately 6 exabytes of wafer output for Western Digital, with most of the wafer output impact expected to be contained in the September quarter.As Mike will explain, we anticipate we will be able to largely mitigate any revenue impact for the September and December quarters. With respect to flash inventory, based on recent industry announcements, and a stronger demand environment, we estimate that any excess inventory will be substantially reduced by the end of this calendar year. It's still too early to characterize it as a trend, but we are seeing a more stable pricing environment for our flash business.In summary, we are successfully navigating dynamic market conditions. Our hard drive business is performing well and we believe that the flash market has reached a cyclical trough. The secular trends of data growth and its increasing value, key drivers of our business opportunities are strong. Our continued transformation into a data infrastructure company is on solid footing and we look forward to reporting on our progress. I want to thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support.With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Mike Cordano: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. I'd like to begin by amplifying Steve's perspectives on fiscal 2019. We made significant strides in broadening and strengthening our product portfolio, particularly in capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, client SSDs and embedded products, while maintaining our strength in our retail offerings.In fiscal 2019, we expanded our lead in aerial density and established the 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive as an industry standard. We were the first to announce the 16 and 18 terabyte products based on our energy assisted recording technology. In flash, we’re the first to successfully commercialize our 96 layer 3D technology across a range of products. And we will continue to implement it across the rest of our portfolio in the remainder of calendar 2019.Moving to highlights for the June quarter. In Data Center Devices and Solutions, a broad adoption of our new capacity enterprise products drove a mid-single digit year-over-year exabyte shipment growth for the first half of calendar 2019, outpacing industry growth resulting in exabyte share gain. Coupled with our continuing expectation for stronger demand in the second half of calendar 2019, we have high confidence that our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth will meaningfully exceed 30% for this calendar year.With this strong demand, we are seeing some signs of supply constraints within our capacity enterprise product portfolio. Our 14 terabyte capacity enterprise drive qualification activities are complete at virtually all hyper scale and OEM customers. And the accelerating adoption of this higher capacity drive further extended our leadership in this category. There have been some market rumors suggesting that customers are skipping the 14 terabyte generation to adopt the 16 terabyte capacity point, but our demonstrated performance with our 14 terabyte offering should invalidate those claims.In addition, we're on track to introduce our first energy assisted recording 16 terabyte CMR and 18 terabyte SMR hard drives later this calendar year. In enterprise SSDs, I'm pleased that our internally developed NVMe platform is commencing revenue ramp at hyperscale and OEM customers in the current quarter. Next week at the Flash Memory Summit, we will be announcing additional enterprise NVMe products, implemented with BiCS4. We expect a significant acceleration of our enterprise NVMe product revenues over the course of fiscal 2020 and beyond.Within Client Devices, surveillance continues to be a long term driver for client HDDs. We are leading the transition in this area to drive managed SMR. In the September quarter, we expect to see a strong revenue ramp of our drive managed SMR products, allowing us to meaningfully participate with compelling surveillance portfolio. For client SSDs, shipments of our NVMe based products grew significantly, representing nearly 50% of our client SSD revenue. As price points have declined, we are seeing customers migrating to higher capacity points and the average capacity per unit of our client SSDs increased 50% on a year-over-year basis.In Client Solutions, we are very pleased with our continuing success in the external SSD category with further expansion in our market share. Average capacity per unit for flash devices -- I'm sorry. In mobile and embedded, we continue to strengthen our product portfolio, including the announcement of a 3D NAND grade product, broadening our automotive offering with unique capacities and capabilities. Due to market conditions and geopolitical dynamics, we reduced our participation in mobile during the June quarter and expect to see immediate recovery of our participation in mobile in the September quarter.I would now like to make a comment on Huawei. As Steve described previously, we stopped shipments to Huawei for about a month, having subsequently resumed shipments. As a result of the stoppage, we estimate there was approximately $100 million revenue impact in the June quarter. In addition, given the ongoing uncertainties, our near term opportunities at Huawei have been reduced.In Client Solutions, we were very pleased with our continuing success in the external SSD category with further expansion in our market share. Average capacity per unit for flash devices grew 36% year-over-year. The power of our brand and our customers’ preference for their performance and reliability of our solution allowed us to maintain our leadership position.From a flash supply perspective, as Steve mentioned, the JV fabs have essentially resumed normal operations. I will share a few additional details on the impact of the fab power outage and Bob will provide the financial implications.We anticipate the incident will result in a reduction of Western Digital's flash wafer availability of approximately 6 exabytes, consistent with our prior estimates. For the balance of calendar 2019, given constrained supply, we're working closely with our customers to align to their increasing demand. For calendar 2019, we estimate industry flash supply growth in the, low 20% range.Turning to flash technology, the ramp of BiCS4, our 96 layer 3D flash technology is progressing well and we expect bit crossover exiting the September quarter. We expect to ship BiCS4 technology offerings in each of our product lines before the end of calendar 2019. Looking beyond the normal course of business, we're driving an important industry level initiative called Zoned Storage. This approach is an open source standards based initiative, which was formally announced in June and will be further discussed and demonstrated with the flash memory summit next week.From a customer perspective, the key benefits of Zoned Storage include lower total cost of ownership, intelligent data placement, and greater economies of scale for applications such as video, artificial intelligence, machine learning and IoT. Zoned Storage will utilize a combination of SMR hard drives and NVMe SSDs, including QLC offerings. The Zoned Storage initiative brings together our deep expertise in both the underlying storage and system level technologies and is a great example of what the power of our portfolio can deliver for our customers.In summary, we are entering the new fiscal year with a significantly enhanced product portfolio, leaner cost and expense structure and a persistent drive to address and capture the opportunities presented by the growth in and increasing value of data. The Western Digital platform continues to strengthen and combined with our ongoing focus on execution, we're positioned to perform well in a variety of market conditions.I will now turn the call over to Bob for the financial discussion.
Bob Eulau: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to announce that results for the June quarter were in line with our expectations provided in April. Revenue for the June quarter was $3.6 billion, down slightly from the March quarter. On a sequential basis, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 2%, as we experienced continued strength in capacity enterprise drives. Client Devices revenue declined slightly, as growth in the client SSD market was offset by declines in the client HDD and flash mobile applications.Client Solutions revenue decreased 6% primarily due to lower flash pricing. In the June quarter, flash revenue was $1.5 billion, with a 1% sequential decline in bits and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte decline of 6%. Hard drive revenue of $2.1 billion was up 3% sequentially, led by strong demand for capacity enterprise drives.Moving on to costs and expenses. All of my comments will be related to the non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the June quarter was 24.2%, with a flash gross margin of 19%, and a hard drive gross margin of 28%. Hard drive gross margins were slightly below expectations due to surveillance and desktop margin declines offsetting improved margin in capacity enterprise drives. Hard drive gross margins will show the full benefits in the December quarter from our previously discussed closure of the Kuala Lumpur facility.Excluded from the cost of revenue was a final $67 million charge related to the planned underutilization of our portion of the flash joint venture fab, bringing an end to this program that we announced in late calendar 2018. This quarter, we took a GAAP only charge of $145 million to cost of revenue for the unexpected power outage that impacted equipment and operations in the Yokkaichi flash manufacturing facility. We expect to incur an additional charge in the range of $170 million to $190 million in the September quarter related to this event.We and our partner will be vigorously pursuing recovery of our losses associated with this event. Operating expenses were $722 million, at the low end of our guidance as a result of continued progress on our expense reduction targets. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $169 million and free cash flow was negative $179 million. In the June quarter, we paid $146 million in dividends to our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and our gross debt outstanding was $10.7 billion.Our liquidity position continues to be very strong with the cash and cash equivalents I just mentioned and the $2.25 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. I have no concern regarding our debt covenants, especially given the amendments made to the credit agreement in April. As we generate free cash flow going forward, our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long term shareholder value. After paying our dividend, our next priority with our free cash flow will be to reduce our gross leverage.Inventory dollars were down approximately $160 million sequentially to $3.3 billion. Hard drive inventory decreased due to the drawdown of inventory built to enable the Kuala Lumpur facility closure. Flash inventory also decreased, primarily due to scrap of work-in process inventory at the fab as a result of the power outage. We expect both flash and hard drive inventories to decline further in the September quarter.Now, I will provide our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a non-GAAP basis. Please note that the September quarter will be a 14 week period. We expect revenues to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 24% to 25%. Please note that this range includes approximately $50 million of startup costs associated with our investment in the K1 fab.We're on track with our previously announced difference to lower cost of revenue by $100 million per quarter by the end of the December quarter. Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million on a 14 week basis. We're on track with our original target to reach $740 million in the September quarter on a 13 week basis. The 14th week will add approximately $45 million of operating expenses in the September quarter.We expect interest and other expense of approximately $95 million and we expect the tax rate to be 27% plus or minus two points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share of between $0.15 and $0.35, assuming approximately 300 million in fully diluted shares. For those of you who've worked with me in the past, you know that prudent cash management has all always been one of my key areas of focus.Total cash, capital expenditures at Western Digital include the cash CapEx on our balance sheet, along with the net change in notes receivable for our flash joint ventures. For fiscal 2020, our preliminary estimate for total cash capital expenditures is less than $500 million, which is a significant reduction from the $1.36 billion spent in fiscal 2019. The key drivers for the reduction in total cash capital expenditures are the previously announced planned slowdown in our capital deployment, the timing on the payment for capital equipment and an anticipated increase in lease financing for the flash JVs.Before I turn over the call to the operator, I would like to note that I'm very excited about the company's position as we enter the new fiscal year. For me, personally, it is a great time to be at Western Digital. We clearly have momentum in the capacity enterprise part of our HDD business. And in Flash, we are successfully ramping our NVMe platforms for client and enterprise applications, while maintaining our strong retail presence. There are signs that market conditions in Flash have reached the cyclical trough, and we are now entering the seasonally stronger part of the calendar year. My goal is to ensure that we maintain financial discipline to deliver the best business results as we look into the future.With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Two if I can, real quick. So first of all, underpinning your gross margin assumption for the current quarter, I'm just hoping that you can provide us with a little bit more granularity of how we should think about the trajectory of the hard disc drive gross margin given that that was relatively weak, I think versus expectations in this last quarter. And then how do we think about the gross margin on the flash business, not just for this current quarter, but as we start to see kind of the cyclical trough story play out, how we think about the gross margin, moving higher over the next couple of quarters?And then I do have a follow up.
Steve Milligan: Yeah. So Aaron, I'll address that and then Mike and Bob can add a little bit of color. In terms of HDD gross margins, if you go back historically, I know you're well familiar with us, Aaron, that we would normally expect our gross margins to be in the low kind of 30% range, say 31%, 32%. So we're operating below where we'd like to be. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of this year, and certainly into 2020, we would see our gross margins begin to move more back into that range. And so that's kind of our expectation from that standpoint.Flash, I would say that, will be similar performance, maybe slightly down to -- it kind of hard. But range, let's say roughly similar to where we're at right now, a lot of that's going to depend upon the pricing environment. And we're seeing a more stable pricing environment from what we've seen over the last several quarters. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of fiscal 2020, we will see an improving gross margin profile on our flash business as well.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And Aaron, let me just add, and Bob mentioned this. So in our desktop category, so the so the drag in the quarter just reported is really we're in the midst of a product transition on desktop and surveillance. So that was a drag to HDD margin. And just to reiterate what Steve said, we expect to see trending up sequential HD margin in the back half of this year and beyond.
Steve Milligan: I’d just add one thing. The other thing I mentioned is on the flash side, we are expecting improvement, but we do have a headwind of the K1 startup costs, which we saw some in the fourth quarter, will see again in the first quarter and throughout this fiscal year.
Aaron Rakers: Very helpful. And then just as a real quick follow-up on the flash business, I think, one of the notable things that differs in your results here tonight is kind of the capacity shipment number down 1% on a sequential basis. First, I think Hynix and Samsung were like 30% or 40%. So I'm curious of how you think about that differential. Is it Huawei driven? Is it your lack of participating in kind of the discrete market? And what is your expectation as far as bit growth into the September quarter? Thank you.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so as I talked about in my script, Aaron, this has really impacted the mobile category. And it's both some impact to the geopolitical activity, but also some choices around business that we didn't see was favorable from a profitability standpoint or lower ASP. So the two of those drove the bit shipment delta on our side. And obviously, we think we've got more interesting places to spend our bits as we progress through the calendar year.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And Aaron, I mean, you can -- you'll notice this as well, our sequential ASP decline in the flash area was meaningfully lower than other’s reported numbers which there's a direct correlation in terms of that data point, and our participation in the mobile segment.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: A quick one for Bob, the tax rate that you're forecasting here in Q1 is quite high. How should we be -- what is driving that tax rate for the quarter, and how should we think about modeling that for the rest of the year? And I have a follow up.
Bob Eulau: Yeah. Thanks Wamsi for the question. So actually, at the beginning of year, what we do is we forecast the tax rate that we're going to experience for the fiscal year. And we actually have a very good setup here as our profit improves. But right now, given where our profitability is at, we have certain minimum tax payments that we have to make in some jurisdictions around the world, so that's why the rate is somewhat inflated as our profitability improves, as we move forward, we're expecting the rate to come down.
Wamsi Mohan: And then more broadly, you've noted this on a more positive tone around the demand environment. Can you address a little bit more specifically, what specific areas you're seeing signs of demand for EU. And just a follow up quick one on Huawei as well. You said there might have been about 100 million of lost sales here for the stoppage of shipments for a month, but as you resume shipments, it sounded like you're not doing that at your flow rate. So at what rate are you expecting to be shipping in the September quarter, relative to maybe the anticipated reduction that you’re foreseeing here?
Steve Milligan: Okay, on an overall basis, I think the way we look at end market growth, certainly we see strength in data center across both HDD and flash, as we get into the back half of the year. We think there's growth possibilities, both at the market level and specifically for us. We also see continued resilience and normal, cyclical demand flowing through the historical PC category. So we see that trend continuing to be good, both in terms of unit demand, but also in terms of capacity mix of that demand. And generally speaking, mobile is on a relative basis, stronger in the second half than it was in the first half. So I think that's the general theme. So we do see normal seasonality across markets that tend to behave that way. And then obviously, the data center is continuing to show robust capital spending expectations moving forward.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And the relative the Huawei, we have resumed shipment, as we noted in the prepared remarks. But during the time when we see shipment to Huawei, they moved their sourcing requirements to some of our international competitors that were not impacted by the entity list and so when we subsequently resumed shipment, it was at a reduced rate that contemplated them, sourcing components from other competitors.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: If I'm doing the math correctly, so your full year industry outlook for capacity, enterprise HDD, exabytes shipment growth of 30%. That implies about 60% year-over-year -- 60% petabyte consumption in the second half versus the first half. That's very strong acceleration in the second half. First of all, is this about right. And this implies strong capacity enterprise shipments in the second half. Secondly is, the cloud data center, strong uptake, pretty broad based across most of the large US cloud and hyperscale guys or limited just to few.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so I think you're about right. And that's really reflective of our growth. We do see general strength in the market, but I think we're growing at a faster rate than the rest of the market.
Bob Eulau: Yeah. So the 30% that we were talking about was our growth, not necessarily industry.
Steve Milligan: Correct. But your math is on, if you look at half to half comparison.
Bob Eulau: 60-40 is consistent with our math.
Harlan Sur: Got it. Okay. And I appreciate that good traction in the 14 terabyte. On enterprise NVMe commencing revenue ramp this quarter, good to see the initial design win traction, when will the higher margin profile of these products start to show up as a mix related gross margin impact, is it December quarter you think? Is it more first half of next calendar year?
Steve Milligan: Yeah, I think there's some positive impact in the December quarter and it will sort of accelerate as we move forward.
Bob Eulau: Yeah. And the other thing is that, putting aside what it'll do to margins, it also allows us to diversify and de-risk our placement of bits going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Thanks for letting me ask the question. Two if I may. First, Steve or Mike, you've made great progress on transitioning to 96 layer 3 NAND. And you indicated in your prepared remarks that client SSD capacity rose 50% year-over-year. I guess I'd like to ask how you think philosophically about your consumer hard disk drive businesses relative to your client SSD businesses, now that NAND prices have effectively been cut in half on a year-over-year basis and NAND demand electricity, as you called out is making SSDs much more economical today.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so I think -- the way we think about that, and I think it's essential to Huawei combine these assets, there will be reasonably long tail on client HD assets, both 2.5 and 3.5. But what we've seen as we move back into this pricing regime is this sort of continued predicted penetration of SSDs into what was historically the HD part of the PC market. So that continues sort of as planned. Obviously, with the adjustment we made in our manufacturing footprint, was in recognition of that. So I think from our standpoint, things are generally progressing as planned. And we're well situated to take advantage of that shift from one to the other, maintaining sort of the profit delivery of the HDD business as it moves into its later stages within the PC segment, but grow within the SSD transition on the other side.
Karl Ackerman: I guess, as my follow-up question, regarding your NAND industry bit supply assumption of low-20s, I assume that's a production number. But how should we think about your own bit supply number, which I guess I would imagine would be mid-30s or higher? And as in relation to that, I'm curious how we think about idling wafer capacity and going after receiving market share in certain areas, mobile, as we described earlier, when some of the South Korean peers appear to be going after share near term? I guess, how should we think about the longer term implications of that in regards to our cost structure?
Steve Milligan: Yeah. So I think one of the things to think about is we focus very carefully on relative capacity share. I think we remain in a quite competitive position. The short term decisions we’ll make based upon sort of economic and current market conditions we see is more tertiary. Right. So ultimately, we were comfortable with the decision we made several quarters ago to run underutilized that brought us into the middle of the year with a better overall inventory position than we would have otherwise had. And ultimately, we're able to place our bets in a way that gives us a better overall economic outcome.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And I would just -- to quibble a little bit with your choice of wording, I would not say that we seeded market share in the mobile market, we determine that at the prices that were in effect, it did not make economic sense to take that business. And so it was an economic decision that went into that as opposed to the seeding of market share.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess a bit of a follow-up question. Not sure I completely understood. I believe on the NAND bit growth outlook for calendar ‘19 across the board, we've heard 30 plus percent from your three major competitors. And you guys are talking low-20. So is the low-20s what you expect to ship this year that's production. And as part of that, if in fact, you are growing less than the industry, can you speak to how you're going to focus those bits? And what are the implications we should be thinking about due to NAND gross margins?
Bob Eulau: Yeah, so let me clarify both, the 20% and the 30%. If we look at the consumption of bits by our customers, and this is an industry statement, it would be in that 30% range. Well, we're talking about the 20%. That is our estimate of industry growth and supply. The difference between the 30% and the 20% is consumption of industry inventory, which we estimate will be largely back in balance, as we exit this calendar year.
C.J. Muse: And you're talking industry inventory downstream or on bit maker books?
Bob Eulau: Industry in the supply chain, whether it's inventory on ours and our competitors’ books, or if inventory that was built up either in the channel or at our customers.
C.J. Muse: So I guess as we model you guys through the second half of the year, we should be thinking about your bit shipments to revenue in the low 30s range of the low 20s range.
Mike Cordano: Yeah, so you should think about us in the low-30s range.
C.J. Muse: And then I guess as my follow up, as you think about just short term for the Q3 guide, I'm coming to roughly 60% of the incremental revenue growth coming from NAND, is that fairly accurate?
Steve Milligan: We're going to see growth in both hard drive and in NAND. I don't know if we’re going to get too specific on the markets, but it's going to show good growth in both areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]
Unidentified Analyst: I have a couple of follow ups. It’s actually encouraging to hear cycle bottoming. And I think demand for -- is going to be volatile. But it seems to me that you have a better control of the cost. So if I were to hypothesize and assume that, ASPs would just be flat, NAND ASPs flat, how should I think about your ability to expand NAND margin, and I'm not asking for a specific margin target, I'm just trying to understand, a, the mix of business that you're pursuing, especially given your preference on high margin business, and b, how the 96 layer 3D NAND is going to impact your cost. So any color on margin expansion, assuming the prices will be flat in ‘20 will be great.And I have a follow up?
Steve Milligan: This is Steve. Let me address that in a broader sense. We expect, as we move through fiscal 2020 that our gross margins for both hard drives and flash will improve, resulting in increasing earnings as we move through fiscal 2020.
Unidentified Analyst: We just have to wait and see how the supply and demand dynamics would impact pricing to have a better sense of gross margin, would that be fair?
Steve Milligan: Yes, in a literal sense. But asset with a specific dynamics are, we expect that our gross margins will continue to improve for both hard drives and flash as we move through fiscal 2020. Also, with the expense reductions and other things that we would see an increasing and improving EPS performance as we move through fiscal 2020.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And just a follow-up question for Bob. We've had two consecutive quarter of negative free cash flow, how does it evolve into the second half of the calendar year and given your conservative CapEx and improving margin profile, should we expect free cash flow growth accelerate into the new calendar year?
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so good question and we're very focused on cash generation right now. And I do expect we'll see improvement. We're not going to give a forecast for free cash flow for next year. But we're definitely expecting to generate cash. And as I mentioned, there are some timing benefits for us with respect to CapEx next year. So I think it'll be a pretty good cash generation year.
Unidentified Analyst: Would it be kind of breakeven at the worst case into the second half of the year?
Steve Milligan: I would say definitely a worst case.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Two questions from me as well. First of all, just getting back to the mix issue. Is it reasonable to assume, given some of the positive product developments you talked about on the opening that you start to see gross margin benefits from mix, as you get maybe into the second or third fiscal quarter of this year? And where we might see that in HDDs and NAND. So, then I had a quick follow up.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. So let me talk about flash. So I think it is reasonable to assume that on every -- on a normalized basis, our flash margin mix will help us on the margin rate. Obviously, to the comment Steve made, we expect the overall margin rate on flash and HDD to continue to migrate in a positive direction through the year. Same goes for HDD, as the capacity enterprise becomes an increasingly large part of our output, we see an upward trend on mix as it affects market.
Steven Fox: And then just following on that answer on the HDD side with the 14 TB ramp now going pretty strong, do we think about average capacity per drive, maybe reaccelerating, especially as you get into ‘16 and ’18 TBs or do we look back at how it's been over the last 18 to 24 months as a guide for going forward?
Mike Cordano: I think we're going to see sort of, our long term sort of rate is 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We obviously have seen a down year this year, but we expect to return over time to roughly that 40% annualized growth.
Steve Milligan: And that's capacity enterprise, Steven.
Steven Fox: And that's including, based on what you're seeing in terms of your own product development, say which is beyond a year.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. Now, yes, and that is a industry number. And obviously, our performance at least in the short term, we're out performing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Just wondering on your NAND side, what’s the split of 64 to 96 layer and, especially exiting the year?
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so we talked about that in my prepared remarks. Big crossover happens as we exit this quarter in September. That’s the 96 layer. So the total bit output crossover point happens in n September.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And just to clarify, I think you mentioned CapEx, cash CapEx goes to 500 million for fiscal ‘20 from 1.5 billion in fiscal ‘19. Is that correct and do you think that will impact any of your bit supply or transitions as you go into fiscal ‘20?
Mike Cordano: Yeah, I don't think it's going to impact our production volumes at all. As I mentioned, we are going to benefit from the timing of the capital deployment next year. So we'll have the capital deployed, and we're not expecting to pay for all of it within the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Munjal Shah with UBS.
Munjal Shah: Just two go real quick. First, on the Data Center Solutions business. If you look at it sequentially, revenues were up only 2%, while capacity enterprise was really strong. I was just wondering if there were any offsets in that business where revenue could be stronger.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. So I think the offset is to some modest degree, enterprise SSD, which as we discussed, will resume growth in the back half of the calendar year, first half of the fiscal year.
Munjal Shah: And then the second question on the NAND side, as your supply comes on from the Yokkaichi fab and it comes back fully, do you think you'll be equally -- you'll be able to place this everywhere or would you still be?
Steve Milligan: We expect that we will have sufficient demand for the bits that we will be generating this quarter and beyond in the near term. We expect to be fully sold out in that regard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Two if I could, Steve and Mike. Just would love to get your updated thoughts on how you're viewing the potential for this hyperscale cycle? I think on the last call, Steve, you said you thought where you guys made remarks that you thought it would go until at least the June quarter of fiscal ‘20. But that potentially could go through the calendar year. So I would love to get your thoughts there.And then also thoughts on maybe potentially strength of it as well, and then I have a quick follow up.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so I think what we've talked about was, we see core strength through the end of this year, and as best we can tell into the second half of our fiscal year, so first half of calendar year. So anything beyond that is a little outside of our normal visibility.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, great. And then any context on how I guess on degree of strength?
Steve Milligan: Yeah, I think degree of strength, we sort of talked to in our guide. So we think we're going to be above the 30% growth rate this year. So it's been strengthening as the year has progressed. And I really think it's heading back towards that average of 40% year-on-year sort of growth.
Mike Cordano: Yeah. And then I don't know if that helps a little bit. But, we had been talking about second half strength in terms of hyperscale demand. I mean, frankly, since the beginning of the year, I would say that our level of conviction regarding that has remained pretty constant as we've moved through this calendar year and remains at a high level. So, we've got pretty good confidence that previous comments that we've made in that regard remain in effect.
Operator: The last question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital, before we end with a short statement by our CEO.
Mitch Steves: Very good color on the NAND bottoming here. But I just had a quick question just in terms of you cost controls, I think that one of the big questions I have is, if you have a demand environment that’s similar to let's say, about a year and a half ago, do you think that you have the ability to reduce OpEx even further, meaning that the operating margin could actually exceed the prior levels when NAND pricing improves?
Bob Eulau: Well, the team has done a lot of work in terms of getting the cost structure in place this year. And, we're, as I mentioned, going to have the cost structure we want from an OpEx standpoint in the December quarter, probably would have had it in September, had it not been for the 14th week, I don't know that we're going to see a lot of opportunity to reduce from there and continue to execute the roadmap, which we're pretty pleased with.
Mike Cordano: And one of the things I'll add a little bit of color on that, I've been around a little bit longer than Bob. So I can probably add a little bit more. But, I think, one of the things that we learned having gone through the up and down cycle of the flash cycle is that because we're expecting that things are going to improve, we talked about a cyclical trough in terms of the flash market, what we want to do is we want to drive for efficiency, as we are going through an up cycle, and not add back expenses that were previously taken out through the down cycle. That's not necessarily a promise that we will drive below this $740 million. But we're going to continue to drive for efficiency as the demand and pricing environment improves.
Mitch Steves: And then just one quick follow up related to kind of the hard disk drive business. So one of the things I understood is that the larger 16 terabyte drives take a little bit longer to build essentially, maybe an extra 30 to 60 days. So your comment about no change to kind of your data center expectations, do you guys have better visibility than you had when you were selling, let's say, 8 terabyte drives or smaller size drives or is that incorrect?
Steve Milligan: Well, in general, we have increasingly good visibility because of the evolving sort of maturity of the cloud providers. So often, just the sort of operational engagement with them gives us a better view into their plans. And of course, in some instances, we've even got commercial arrangements that give us a very good feel for their intentions. We have one particular case where we actually are paid to carry some inventory for continuity supply reasons. And that gives us a very good feel for their deployment plans. And so it's really that that allows us to do it. And as you say, as capacities grow, there isn’t a lengthening lead time. So that's important for us to have, but obviously over time, we want to counter that lead time lengthening with best time improvements that help shorten our cycle time.
Steve Milligan: Alright, well, thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing our dialog. Have a great rest of the day.
Mike Cordano: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
Peter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon. Before I begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward looking statements including business plans trends and financial outlook, based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.
Stephen Milligan: Thank you Peter, and good afternoon everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is Robert Eulau, newly appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will formally take over the CFO role from Mark Long on May 9, 2019. Bob has more than 30 years' experience in various financial and operational leadership roles in the technology industry. And I'm pleased to welcome him to the Western Digital Team.
Robert Eulau: Thanks, Steve. I'm excited to be part of the Western Digital Team and I look forward to working with all of our investors and analysts in the future.
Stephen Milligan: Turning to our business, market conditions have generally been consistent with our expectations described in January. That being said, we are encouraged to see demand incrementally improve in certain areas such as capacity enterprise and client compute. Our expectation for the demand environment to further improve for both flash and hard drive products for the balance of calendar 2019 is largely unchanged. And looking at the quarter from a product perspective, sales of hard drives were a bit stronger than expected. Higher demand for capacity enterprise products drove most of the upside and we saw a nice rebound at higher capacity points. We are experiencing a very smooth product ramp with our 14TB product. In addition, we also realized a significant expansion of our presence in the mid-range. Demand for flash-based products was slightly better than expectations; however, prices declined more than we anticipated. We are executing well on the plans we laid out last quarter, in terms of enhancing our product lineup, driving technology advancements, rightsizing our factory production levels, and lowering our cost and expense structures. We continue to make excellent progress toward commercializing our internally developed NVMe based platforms. I'm pleased to report the commencement of initial revenue shipments of our enterprise NVMe SSD and we are on track to accelerate the volume ramp of this product over the remainder of calendar 2019. We also commence shipments of our NVMe client SSDs based on 96-layer, 3D flash, BiCS4 technology. The manufacturing ramp and commercialization of BiCS4, which we believe is the industry's lowest cost technology is progressing well. In the second half of calendar 2019, BiCS4 will become our highest volume runner in terms of flash output. In HDDs, we continue to lead the industry in aerial density through technologies such as SMR and energy-assisted recording and are on track to ship our first energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives later this year. From a flash supply perspective, we are continuing our previously announced wafer output reductions without compromising our cost leadership position. We made substantial progress on realigning our cost and expense structure. The Kuala Lumpur manufacturing facility has largely ceased operations and combined with other actions we are already realizing incremental cost savings. Our focus is on driving long-term value creation for Western Digital and its stakeholders, while prudently navigating near business conditions. Emerging technologies such as 5G open up new applications and use cases creating immense amounts of data. Further, applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, mobility and IoT will continue to generate growing data volumes that need to be captured, preserved, accessed and transformed. The relentless pace of innovation bodes well for the long-term growth in the data storage requirements and the resulting opportunities for our company. I want to thank the Western Digital Team and our partners for their ongoing support. I would also like to thank Mark Long for his service to Western Digital. Mark has been instrumental in the transformation of the company and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors. With that, Mike will now share our business highlights.
Michael Cordano: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Starting with our highlights for the March quarter, within Data Center Devices and Solutions, our capacity enterprise drive category performed better than expected with demand strengthening as we move through the quarter. For the first half of calendar 2019, we now expect total exabyte shipments in capacity enterprise to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, if current demand trends continue, we see an opportunity for the category to reach 30% year-over-year growth in exabytes for calendar year 2019 .This updated industry forecast is a significant upward revision from our prior estimate that was in the low 20% range. Our 14TB capacity enterprise drive qualification and adoption have been seamless and we are leading the industry in this transition. We are in the midst of a significant ramp of this product in the current quarter. We are on track to introduce our first energy assisted 16TB CMR and 18TB SMR hard drives later this calendar year. Compared to competitive solutions, our new products will be cost optimized offerings containing fewer disks and heads showcasing our significant aerial density advantage. Our refreshed product line in the mid-range capacities also did very well and in total, we have meaningfully increased our presence in the capacity enterprise category. Just a few weeks ago, we were delighted to hear that the Western Digital storage solutions played a key role in unveiling of the first ever image of a super massive black hole. The event horizon telescope project utilized our high capacity helium drives, which performed reliably in harsh, high altitude, and remote environments. This unique event, highlights the fundamental role we play in the capture and transformation of data. In enterprise SSDs, NVMe product qualifications at hyperscale customers are progressing to plan. This product built on our internally developed controller and firmware, complements our other enterprise SSD solutions that are already shipping. Consistent with the platform approach we discussed last quarter, we expect to expand our enterprise SSD product portfolio throughout 2019 in a cost effective and predictable manner, including a version that incorporates BiCS4. In Client Devices, demand for hard drives for the PC market was slightly better than our expectations. In client SSDs, our exabyte shipments more than doubled from a year ago quarter driven by strong price elasticity. Additionally, we've begun shipping our mainstream client SSD products based on BiCS4 technology. In client solutions, we are very pleased with the success of our external SSDs sold through retail and we have continued to expand our presence in this category over the last several quarters. In the March quarter, we also launched the world's fastest 1TB microSD card, establishing an industry first in the removal products category. Average capacity per unit for flash devices grew 44% year-over-year, reflecting significant price elasticity. From a flash supply perspective, we remain on track to achieve an overall reduction of 10% to 15% of our bit output in calendar year 2019. Despite seasonal softness in the March quarter, our flash inventory level was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. As we look to our fourth fiscal quarter, we expect to see a full quarter impact from our reduction in wafer starts, which will help to further reduce our flash inventory levels. This combination of stabilized inventory and lower supply growth in flash will allow us to be more selective in how we pursue flash revenue opportunities going forward. In terms of longer term planning for flash, the construction of the building showing what a Japan is on track with meaningful output from this fab expected in fiscal 2021. Based on this schedule and the planned slowdown in our capital deployments, we expect lower flash related capital spending for fiscal 2020 of our 96-layer based products continues as expected, we are pleased to be shipping the industry's leading technology into retail products and client SSDs. In the June quarter, we estimate BiCS4 to represent more than 25% of our total shippable flash bits. We are on track to implement BiCS4 across our portfolio including mobile embedded and enterprise later this calendar year. As Steve mentioned earlier, we have largely stopped production activities at the KL facility. We have also consolidated our head manufacturing operations from Thailand to the Philippines. These continuing actions are allowing us to lower our cost structure and rightsize our manufacturing footprint to meet long-term demand. Turning to our outlook, we see a few additional data points indicating incremental improvement in current demand conditions compared to a very tough fourth calendar quarter. Flash pricing conditions remain challenging, but we anticipate the rate of price decline will moderate as the year progresses due to a slowing rate of industry supply growth, elasticity driving demand for higher capacity points, and seasonal strength in the back half of the calendar year. Based on recent industry announcements, we estimate flash industry supply growth to be slightly more than 30% in calendar 2019, somewhat lower from our prior forecast. To summarize, our current product portfolio is the best in our history. In HDDs, the migration to higher capacity drives plays to our strength in technology and manufacturing. In Flash, our product portfolio in 2019 has been significantly enhanced with the expansion of our NVMe product line for both client and enterprise SSDs and we continue to have brand leadership in retail. We are taking appropriate steps in a challenging market environment to position ourselves for ongoing success. I will now turn the call over to Mark, for the financial discussion.
Mark Long: Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our guidance range. Flash revenue was $1.6 billion with a sequential bit decline of 5% and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte decline of 23%. The sequential decline in Flash revenue was primarily due to price, seasonality, and weaker sales of embedded mobile products. Our Drive revenue was $2.1 billion, which was similar to the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was 25.3%, below our guidance of approximately 28% due to a $110 million charge or 300 basis point impact incurred for lower of cost or market LCM reserves. Flash non-GAAP gross margin was 21% due to the rate of price productions and the aforementioned $110 million LCM charge, primarily related to an inventory write down of multi-chip packages that contain DRAM. Hard drive gross margin on a non-GAAP basis rose to 29% compared to the prior quarter driven by an increased mix of capacity enterprise drives, excluded from the non-GAAP cost of revenue is a $148 million charge related to the under-utilization of our portion of the flash joint venture fans. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $742 million; the lower guidance as a result of better progress towards our expense reduction targets. As a reminder, for non-GAAP cost of goods sold, we expect the full benefit of our $100 million per quarter cost reduction efforts to be reflected by the end of the December quarter of 2019. And for non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect to see the full results of our $100 million per quarter expense reduction efforts to be reflected within the September quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $49 million, which was higher than estimated due to a quarterly effective tax rate true-up, and the fact that our tax expense is a relatively fixed dollar amount at this profitability level. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.17. The LCM charge impacted and diluted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.37. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $204 million and free cash flow was a negative $110 million, primarily due to lower operating income. In the March quarter, we paid $146 million in dividends to shareholders. At quarter end, we had $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities and our principal debt outstanding was $10.8 billion. Earlier today, we announced the successful execution of an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreements. The amendment provides Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility to navigate market cycles. Turning to inventory, on a dollar basis, hard drive inventory decreased and flash inventory was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter after the impact of the LCM reserves. Looking into the June quarter, we expect of flash and HDD inventory to decline on a sequential basis. I will now provide our guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $3.6 to $3.8 billion, gross margin of approximately 24% to 25%, operating expenses between $720 million and $740 million, interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, tax expense between $20 million and $30 million, diluted shares of approximately $295 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.30. Finally, for modeling purposes, please note that the September 2019 quarter will have 14 weeks instead of the normal 13 weeks. In closing before I turn the call to the operator for the Q&A, I would like to thank Steve, Mike, and the entire Western Digital Team for the opportunity to serve as the Company's CFO. It's been a great experience working with all of you. With that, operator, please begin the Q&A session.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the today's call. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Steve or Mark, this amendment to the credit facility is prudent, but would you say this is just preemptive versus your expectations of EBITDA and free cash flow generation over the next few quarters, has that changed in a material fashion?
Mark Long: Yes. We took the opportunity to amend our credit agreements because the markets were favorable and this does give us a significant amount of additional flexibility and we were able to do it with very low cost.
Wamsi Mohan: And do you expect -- your expectation of just sort of the EBITDA generation as you look over the next few quarters? How would you care to price that?
Mark Long: This was not in response to any near-term concerns. This was just a prudent move that gives us good long-term flexibility.
Wamsi Mohan: And if I could really quick, Steve you mentioned demand trends were largely unchanged. Could you just talk about sort of what has changed in that capacity enterprise uptake? What -- where do you think that is coming from a customer base standpoint and maybe even regionally if there are some color there? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Sure. I will have Mike comment on it I mean -- provide a little bit more detail on capacity enterprise, but as I indicated capacity enterprise was a bit stronger than what we expected, which we were very pleased to see that. Client compute as you will know, PC volumes continued to decline, but they declined at a more moderate rate than what at least we were expecting, one area of a bit of weakness from a demand perspective, which I think is largely known in the investment community is handset volumes were a bit lower than expected, so we did see a little bit of draw down as a result of that, but Mike can comment a little bit more on the capacity enterprise upside that we saw.
Michael Cordano: Yes. Wamsi, I think capacity enterprise it was fairly broad-based. At the highest capacity, I think it would be viewed as sort of domestic hyperscale providers. We saw strength of demand both in our 12TB and 14TB products and then in a mid-range, we saw strength in Asia. So, we saw a fairly broad based strength across the capacity enterprise gateway.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I can real quick. So, first of all -- just kind of thinking about how you rolled up to the guidance number that you've given, particularly around gross margin. Can you help us understand assuming that the Kuala Lumpur facility closure kind of keeps a positive trend on gross margin and also coupled with the commentary of the demand for the high capacity drives. If we were to assume hard disk drive gross margin kind of stays flattish here, it would appear like your flash gross margin looks to be maybe in that 17%, 18%, 19% range. So for first of all, am I kind of thinking about your guidance in the context of flash gross margin correctly and underneath that what assumptions are you making in terms of pricing and kind of cost down discussion as we go into the June quarter?
Stephen Milligan: So, I'll give some overall comment Aaron and then either Mike or Mark can add a little bit more specifics. One of the things that I will highlight if you go back particularly to fiscal Q2 our gross margin levels for the hard drive business had gotten kind of below what we normally expect at 27% I believe is the number. We saw a nice rebound this quarter as we begin to see some of those cost improvements that you noted as well as a better mix in terms of capacity enterprise. We would expect that that would continue and will continue -- and we'll work our way back up into a, let's call it, a more normalized gross margin level in the hard drive space, which clearly implies that given that we're guiding essentially the flat gross margins that we'll continue to see a downdraft in terms of flash gross margins in the current quarter as we see cost -- price pressures continue. As Mike indicated in his commentary, we expect although of course we don't know for sure that that price decline will moderate as we move through the calendar year. So, it'll take a little bit of time for that to get into a more acceptable range of price declines. So, I don't know if that helps a bit Aaron in terms of high level commentary.
Michael Cordano: Yes. The other thing I'll add Aaron is on the flash cost declines. We've kind of talked about being at the low end of long-term range at 15%-ish. So, you'll have to think about it that way on an annualized basis.
Aaron Rakers: And then just a real quick follow-up if I can, if I think about how you kind of consider a longer term gross margin what -- as we kind of get back to a more normalized trend in the product portfolio kicks in, what do you guys think is a good way to think about what you would consider as a normalized gross margin in the flash business. And I'll end it at that. Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Talking about the margin range, I think is...
Mark Long: Yes. I mean, I think on an overall basis we are not changing our long-term model at this point. So, we just need to see the industry work off the inventory and the price declines to moderate as we've talked about and then as flash normalizes and Steve talked about the improvements in the hard drive gross margins through the back half, we -- we should see the kinds of dynamics we talked about at the last Investor Day.
Stephen Milligan: Yes. And to put a finer point on it Aaron, if you just look at our model that's high 30's, low 40's for Flash.
Aaron Rakers: So you think you can get there in the back half of the calendar year?
Stephen Milligan: We're not saying that Aaron.
Aaron Rakers: Okay.
Mark Long: No. We're talking about the long-term model. You said in the long-term, yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Hi, good afternoon everyone. I just want to go back to margins, if I could for a second so your margins in there would suggest that you're losing money on an operating level, but how much of your margin decline was due to the near-term costs ramp -- of ramping BiCS4 and your NVMe SSD that may reverse as volumes ramp for the balance of 2019? And secondarily to that, I think you initially announced total underutilization cost would be $250 million to $300 million, we've got probably another $75 million to go and so may you remind us, how much of the $400 million annualized benefit in COGS from your restructuring actions will be realized in June and then taking those two as a whole, how do we think about the margin trajectory at least qualitatively for the second half in that? Thank you.
Michael Cordano: I'll talk to sort of flash cost downs and given the ramp of BiCS4, I just talked about the annualized rate that is more back half loaded, so we see a shallower cost decline in the first half more to come in the back half and Mark you want to.
Mark Long: Well, I think you are exactly right in terms of our underutilization charge with the majority of it occurring in the prior quarter and through this quarter. So, we haven't given a breakdown in terms of the amount of our Kuala Lumpur shutdown benefit that we're receiving in the Q4. But as we said, we will be getting that full $400 million a year of cost benefit exiting calendar Q4 this year.
Stephen Milligan: Yes. The other thing I'll comment on relative to our ability to navigate the market, our inventory position that we discussed being sort of more in check and improving sequentially allows us to be more selective and when we talk about selectivity, that's -- think about it as quality of the business which would be profitability via principle measurement and all that.
Michael Cordano: Yes. I mean if you look at -- I'll provide a little bit of additional commentary, which will be largely consistent with what I talked about at the last earnings call is that you know as we move through the balance of the calendar year. One, starting from a top line perspective, we expect our top line to improve at a meaningful rate as we see demand pick up, capacity enterprise as well as seasonal pickup in demand from both a flash and from a hard drive perspective. That will allow us -- obviously we'll have higher revenue. We will also have more of the benefit of the cost and expense reductions, as we particularly move into the September quarter or then in December. And so, that will allow us to see some lift in terms of our earnings, as we move through the back half of the year. The big question which is the question that you're trying to get at is what is our margin level going to look like? Let me provide a little bit more color on that, in the sense that we continue to expect that our hard drive margins will improve as we move through the balance of the calendar year. Flash becomes the wildcard, now I said this last call and I'm going to say it again because it really is the same answer. What are we assuming? We're assuming that we're going to continue to see pressure in terms of our flash gross margins as we move through the balance of the calendar year. And the reason that we're doing that principally is that, we want to plan for the worst and if you want to call it hope for the best. Now, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to Flash gross margins because a lot of that is dependent upon other factors that are outside of our control. What do our competitors do, production levels, demand levels, and all that. So, we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but from our standpoint it is safest to assume that we're going to continue to see our Flash gross margins remain under some degree of pressure as we move through the calendar year, albeit maybe at a moderating level from a pricing perspective as we move through to the back half of the year.
Karl Ackerman: If I may, just ask more of a question on the hard drive business. Steve or Mike, would you endorse that part of the reason why near line demand has been soft at least for the last two quarters, maybe due to a push out in storage raise until these higher capacity near-line drive progressed through qualification? And secondarily, I'd appreciate hearing from your thoughts on how you view the competitive landscape changing if at all from your line draws as the industry provider's offer slightly different near line technologies in the back half? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: So, I think the principle driver of growth was actually broader inventory levels within the broad based hyperscale levels. So, yes I think there is some modest waiting for the next capacity point that played, let's call it, a secondary role, but the primary role for calendar Q4 and the drop we saw was really inventory levels in them and our customers making an inventory correction. Relative to sort of competitiveness in the back half of the year, I talked about that. I think there is multiple approaches, we're quite comfortable with our approach, it gets there at the next viable capacity point with less heads and disks, which will give us a cost advantage vis-à-vis our competition. So, that's the application of our leading technology in a way that gives us an advantage though, from our standpoint we've talked about energy assist being important to us. As a technology enabler, we continue to be confident that it will give us the benefits we expect and we'll see that in the next generation of products.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. The first question was on the NAND underutilization expenses and if somebody can be a bit more explicit about whether or not you still expect to be taking underutilization in the second half of the calendar year. And then related to that topic, my second question was, asking both now, whatever point those underutilization expenses do stop getting excluded. Where do you think you'll fall within that 15% to 25% annual cost per bit target that the company has for NAND cost downs. Thank you.
Mark Long: Okay. Well, in terms of the underutilization charge as you heard me say earlier, the majority of that will be taken and reflected in the first half of this calendar year. And then a very small portion is left for the remainder as it -- and that is the full extent of our current plan for utilizing the [indiscernible] as relates standing changes to that, Mike.
Michael Cordano: Yes. Relative to any changes as you would expect, we'll continue to monitor market conditions. But at this point, no additional plans beyond what we've already announced. And then relative to sort of the cost implication once, of course we're through that period that's reflected in our estimate of around 15% annualized cost down.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Two follow-ups; Mike, you said near line exabyte growth of 30% 19 versus 18. Is that for Western Digital or is that the industry guide?
Michael Cordano: Yes. Mehdi, we think that's an industry opportunity and obviously we would hope to do a bit better than that.
Mehdi Hosseini: And then, in regards to the NAND bit shipment growth of low 30%. What is your expectation for NAND production bit growth?
Michael Cordano: That is production bit growth, not demand.
Mehdi Hosseini: I see.
Michael Cordano: Supply growth.
Mehdi Hosseini: Supply growth, okay. And then, given your comment on inventory declining for both NAND and HDD into the June quarter, should we assume that days of inventory has finally peaked and is going to decline, looking-forward?
Michael Cordano: We would expect days of inventory be roughly in the same range for Q4 and then to decline and begin to normalize in the backup.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Munjal Shah with UBS.
Munjal Shah: I had one on capacity enterprise. You saw better demand this quarter. Have you seen any indications that the demand for second half could be stronger than what you initially thought, or do you see a risk that we can run into a similar situation as last year, where first half is stronger, and then that can have could be softer?
Michael Cordano: No. Our view and the reason we commented on our expectations for calendar year growth is that we'll see some additional strength in the first half and we believe the second half will remain strong, so that drove our update in our forecast from the low 20's year-on-year total bit growth to approximately 30% year-on-your bit growth.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess I was hoping first question to focus on gross margins. I believe before you were thinking that you would take the cash charges most heavily in the March quarter and to be more bell shaped and now it appears like June quarter based on your guide is similar at a roughly $185 million and you're now taking further utilization plan charges into the back half of '19. So could you share with us.
Mark Long: So let's clarify that C.J. -- let's clarify so our underutilization charge, the largest portion was in the March quarter. Then we are expecting between $55 million and $75 million in the June quarter and then that will account for virtually all of the -- there'll be just a very small amount that will go beyond the June quarter.
Michael Cordano: Yes. C.J. just to reiterate, we have not modified our production plan at all from the original announcement; so hence what Mark just said.
C.J. Muse: And I guess as you think about the adjustment on the leverage ratio amendment, that was really all about the higher rate that goes into January 20 right so you still have the 4.25 times into September, December that's unchanged. So, curious as you look at adjusted EBITDA on an LTM basis and as you project into the back half, is that something that you're going to need to negotiate in your view today?
Mark Long: No. So that was the benefit of the amendment. The amendment really had two great features. One is what you talked about, which is we pushout step down for our total leverage maintenance covenant from 4.25 times to 4 times. We push out that step down by one year. So, it just provides that additional headroom. Now, the second important piece is, we changed the definition of adjusted EBITDA to increase adjusted EBITDA by the amount of the depreciation for our portion of the JV; CapEx basically that is.
Stephen Milligan: That's billed to us in effect by TMC.
Mark Long: Exactly. But it was previously not included in the definition of adjusted EBITDA. So that was a -- that provided us a significant benefit in the calculation of that leverage ratio.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan [ph] with Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: If market conditions warranted basically how much work do you have to further reduce expenses beyond the $800 million annual reduction that you're targeting?
Stephen Milligan: Well, we have not dimensioned that, certainly not externally. The one thing that I will add to that is -- and we commented on this previously is that when we look at let's just talk about our expense structure, forget about the cost structure for the time, but one of the things that we were attempting to not do was to disrupt or harm our future product road map. If market conditions, I mean it's hard to mention this because you don't know if market conditions got more challenging. First off, you'd have to evaluate why they got more challenging and sort of understand that but if they -- if they got more challenging, we would have to take a harder look at our go-forward product roadmap. Right now, we don't think that's necessary based upon our expectations both from a market perspective and from a financial perspective, but that would be the next place that we would go look from an expense standpoint. And like I said, we have not dimensioned any potential opportunity as it relates to that.
Unidentified Analyst: And any commentary that you could provide in terms of NAND flash inventory that you see in the channel? So we know it's flat on your book, but what's your view in terms of what's sitting out there in the channel?
Stephen Milligan: Well, I think we've seen the channel is getting in better shape. I think it's a little bit of a different story with certain manufacturers and there's a different story with each of them obviously, but our case has been that we wanted to get ourselves in a better position relative to flash inventory. We feel comfortable about the actions we took. We think it's put us in that position. So, we see things sort of trending down from here.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Last quarter, you talked about it previously and now wafer starts will reduce supply by 10% to 15% which you kind of reiterate today. But then, you also said you will continue to assess the situation, with three more months of data, what are your thoughts today in terms of further lowering production and maybe remind us what portion of your best supply is in tuning in right now? Thanks.
Stephen Milligan: So at this point, we don't see any need to reduce our output schedule. We talked about the industry supply growth rate being around 30%, we're at or slightly below that. We're comfortable with that position relative to our production plan given our current view of market outlook. We have not commented on the percentage of output on 2D planar. I'll give you this color, the remaining percentage of output tends to be in long life cycle businesses that have quite good economics. So, we're very comfortable with the remaining percentage of our output that's on 2D planar.
Sidney Ho: Maybe just to follow on that; I think you mentioned CapEx will be down in fiscal 2020. Are there any changes for this calendar year or maybe mixing calendar year versus fiscal year there?
Stephen Milligan: So I think just to dimension it, we'd previously said for fiscal '19, our expectation for cash CapEx would be in the $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion range. And we believe will come in at the low end around $1.5 billion for fiscal '19. For fiscal '20, as Mike indicated, we expect our cash CapEx to be lower, and it should be in the $1 billion range at this point.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: I wonder in terms of the utilization comments you said that utilization charges are winding down now. Does that mean that the supply comes back on in the third quarter or should we be modeling for a step function increase in production in Q3 -- in calendar Q3?
Stephen Milligan: Yes. I think the way you should think about it is our industry growth rate for the year will be at or slightly below the 30% we talked about. We chose to implement it in such a way; we took pressure off of our inventory position in the first half of the year, which is seasonally slow. So, I think generally speaking we think we're well aligned with our view of market demand and our inventory position is in a reasonably good position, as we sort of go through this quarter into the back half of the year.
Michael Cordano: Yes. And let me add to that because when we announced these cuts in terms of wafer starts, we had a -- we had a simple goal, which was to get our inventory levels down to a range that we felt comfortable with. With the plan cuts that we have made, we are moving in that direction. Our intent was not to eliminate all pockets of inventory within the system. That will require other activities. So, we are in a position to be where we thought we wanted to be and frankly, we were talking about exiting the June quarter. So, we're kind of in that spot or moving in that spot, but I just want to make sure that everybody is clear in terms of what we were trying to accomplish as a consequence of the web wafer starts that we made to our production levels.
Joe Moore: And then, secondly on the lower cost of market inventory charge. Can you talk about I expect it's generally moving around -- what makes it move big enough to sort of trigger a charge like that and you expect it to repeat in the coming quarters? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Sure. So, with respect to the driver, it has to do with our multi chip package product that goes into smartphones and as we said, these carry the DRAM that we purchase and it turned out one of the reasons it was a higher charge than you might have expected was just a function of the amount of DRAM we had in inventory. And as it relates to future quarters, this is something we evaluate every quarter and this one just was higher than much higher than typical. So we spend time explaining that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: As we look back at the consumption and digestion in the cloud, what they've procured, purchased, and unused; can we look back and kind of help us understand whether if they just pre-buy a lot of our memory and storage or did they find better efficiencies with cloud to use it and is there still more like compression that's really helping them out. But what exactly was the disconnect of why it's taking so long to digest the inventory situation now that we're kind of coming out of there at some point? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So listen, the lowest -- all those factors are at play, but the principal one that occurred in the tail end of calendar 2018, if you remember, lots of components were on constrained supply, so DRAM Flash and even capacity enterprise. So, in that environment, the hyperscale players are very concerned about availability, about the ability to continue to build out their infrastructure, so they bought ahead of demand to secure that supply line. So once the supply -- overall supply environment began to change, they took upon themselves to normalize inventory position. So, that was the primary driver. Yes. There's always an efficiency effort going on within the hyperscale, but that's generally comprehended within our growth rate expectations, the thing that -- that impacted at least us in calendar Q4 was what I just described relative to inventory adjustment.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would not like to turn the call back over to the CEO, for any further remarks.
Stephen Milligan: All right. So thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing our dialogue. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference, this does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-01-25 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Western Digital Corp Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Andrew you may begin.
Peter Andrew: Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including business plans and strategies, industry trends, and business and financial outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations and we assume no obligation to update them to reflect new information or events. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and Guidance Summary that are being posted in the Investor Relations sections of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.
Steve Milligan: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported revenue of $4.2 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $738 million and we delivered $1.45 in non-GAAP earnings per share with $469 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. Despite a softening business environment, our fiscal second quarter results were generally within our guidance ranges. Consistent with indications we provided at our Investor Day, overall demand trends exhibited a negative bias as the quarter progressed, subsequent commentaries from several companies in our served markets and highlighted continued demand weakness. Geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions have contributed to our customers having a more cautious outlook. Additionally Flash industry dynamics remain challenging. Consequently, our outlook for the March quarter will be significantly weaker than it would otherwise be given normal seasonality. I will comment on the actions that we are taking in response to current business conditions. First, we have been transparent in sharing our views on the evolving business environment and we'll continue to do so. In December 2017, we were the first to describe normalization trends in Flash and since then we've enhanced our disclosures to provide greater insight into how we are performing in both Flash and hard drives. Second, from a product perspective, we are entering calendar 2019 with the strongest product portfolio in our history. We expect to further enhance our portfolio throughout the year. In Flash, we continue to lead the industry's transition to 96 layer BiCS4 technology. We expect broad implementation of this technology across our product portfolio in calendar 2019. We have 96 layer products in customer hands today. In the December quarter of calendar 2019, we expect BiCS4 to achieve BiCS mix crossover with the BiCS3 from a supply standpoint. The product development investments we have made are yielding results. Specifically, we have completed development of internal controller and firmware architectures that can be leveraged across our portfolio in client, enterprise, mobile and embedded applications. We now address all the key categories for the enterprise SSD market. In addition, we will be sampling our enterprise NVMe product with BiCS4 by mid-2019. We have a significant market position with our NVMe client portfolio and expect to further capitalize on this success. We will be shipping our mainstream client SSD based on BiCS4 in the March quarter. Our embedded solutions are now shipping to all of the top global smartphone manufacturers enabled by our expanding portfolio of UFS products. Surveillance, automotive and gaming are attractive growth opportunities for Flash and we are already making inroads in these areas. In hard drives we continue to provide the enterprise market with leading aerial densities, enabling the highest capacity points and most cost-effective solutions. We have had an exceptionally smooth qualification process for our 14-terabyte helium drive and expect customer qualification activities for this industry-leading offering to be completed at virtually all of our customers in the current quarter. We've already commenced revenue shipments for several customers. Last quarter we announced a 15 terabyte offering at our Investor Day and described our plans for a 16-terabyte product based on energy assist technology. This will be followed by an 18-terabyte product, details of which will be shared later this calendar year. Data Center Systems continue to gain momentum across all of its product offerings in the quarter. As we've previously indicated, we are taking actions to right-size our factory production levels while ensuring we maintain our competitiveness and technology leadership. In Flash we are executing on the previously announced changes.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Once again ladies and gentlemen please standby.
Peter Andrew: Hi Sherry.
Operator: Hi yes, we can hear you now.
Peter Andrew: Put me back on the line I'm going to begin the call.
Operator: You're in the line, sir. We can hear you now.
Peter Andrew: You can hear?
Operator: Yes, I can hear you.
Peter Andrew: Okay. We're okay on your side now?
Operator: Yes, I believe so.
Peter Andrew: Okay.
Steve Milligan: All right. Well, I don't know where we cut off. Anyway I'm going to back up - sorry about that, I'm going to back a little bit on my script. As we have previously indicated, we are taking actions to right-size our factory production levels while ensuring we are maintaining our competitiveness and technology leadership. In Flash, we are executing on the previously announced changes to our wafer output levels to reduce our bit supply growth for calendar 2019. We are also making adjustments to the pace of our capital investments in Flash in order to align of our bit output with our market demand. Additionally, we have accelerated the closure of our Kuala Lumpur hard drive manufacturing facility by almost three quarters. Lastly, we are implementing substantial cost and expense reductions across the company. In total, we are targeting $800 million in annualized reductions in non-GAAP cost and expenses. Mike and Mark will provide further details in their prepared remarks. The long-term growth opportunities for our business remain unchanged. Transformative trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, mobility, and IoT will continue to drive massive amounts of data that needs to be captured, preserved, accessed, and transformed. Western Digital remains well-positioned to further capitalize on the fundamental opportunities associated with the rapid growth in the volume and value of data. I want to thank the Western Digital team and all our partners for their ongoing support. With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Mike Cordano: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone. We have spent the last two years aggressively investing and building our architectural platforms to power product line expansion. We are now at the point where these platforms and the products launched from these platforms are ramping as we enter 2019. The results of these investments gives us the confidence that we have the strongest portfolio in the company's history. Before I get into the details of our December quarter performance, I'd like to comment on how we intend to capitalize on the strength of our expanding portfolio throughout the calendar year and beyond. Our architectural platforms consisted of a combination of industry-leading-based technologies, internally developed controllers, and the corresponding firmware. The underlying storage technology whether Flash or the hard drive heads and media and the manufacturing and test processes to mass-producer products with high yields and industry-leading quality. We have developed our product portfolio to allow us to increase our participation and differentiated end markets that have strong growth prospects. We are also strengthening our market-facing capabilities across the sales, marketing, and go-to-market organizations. These key ingredients are allowing us to innovate and quickly bring products to our targeted end markets working collaboratively with our customers in the broader ecosystem. We are now in a position to drive greater participation in higher value markets and expect to corresponding improvement in the quality of our revenue throughout 2019. I will illustrate with a few important achievements today. For the data center we began qualifications of our NVMe SSD product in the December quarter and due to stronger customer pull we expect to ramp this product for the meaningful revenue by the middle of this calendar year. Leveraging our enterprise architectural platform and the associated IP blocks, we will be able to expand our enterprise SSD product portfolio throughout 2019 in a cost-effective and predictable manner. This includes shipping BiCS4 based products to customers within this calendar year. In capacity enterprise, we are focused our investments to build upon a highly successful helium technology platform, which has become an industry standard. We continue to maintain our leadership position as demonstrated by the ongoing ramp of our 14-terabyte hard drive and the introduction of our 16-terabyte hard drive later in the calendar year. Our position in the midrange capacity enterprise market continues to strengthen with the ramp of our cost optimized 4 terabyte to 8 terabyte products, fueling customer breadth and geographic penetration. We continue to capitalize on our industry-leading client SSD platform with products spanning from high performance gaining solutions to cost optimized mainstream offerings. All with the quality and reliability customers expect from Western Digital. This platform will enable exciting derivative products which will announce throughout this year. In mobile and embedded, we will further expand our presence within top-tier accounts given our complete portfolio of products to address all categories of this market. We've got it additional design wins with our eMMC and UFS solutions further expanding our customer base and enhancing our position among the top five smartphone manufacturers. We're also successfully developing leading embedded solutions for automotive, connected home, and surveillance categories. This is being illustrated through several of the product announcements, we've made in the second half of 2018 and expect to make in the coming quarters. We are realizing the benefits of two years of accelerated product R&D investments already in terms of greater participation and higher value areas of the market and a broadening customer base. I will now provide additional details on some of the near term actions we are taking. We previously announced the reduction to wafer starts for a proportion of the Flash joint venture along with the way deployment of the capital equipment. The magnitude of these actions is a planned reduction of 10% to 15% of our bid output in calendar 2019. As the year progresses, we will continue to assess market conditions and evaluate the need to make further adjustments to right size our inventory. We are also accelerating our Kuala Lumpur facility closure time line by almost three quarters along with rationalizing other HDD manufacturing costs. In terms of our second quarter results, revenue in each of our end markets declined on year-over-year basis due to a combination of lower demand and aggressive Flash pricing conditions despite healthy growth in Flash bits sold. We maintain our leadership position across our G-Tech, SanDisk and WD brands in our client Solutions portfolio. We grew up presence in client SSDs during the quarter and delivered solid performance on differentiated Form Factor devices such as iXpand. Demand elasticity contributed to a strong 30% year-over-year increase and average capacity in the Flash portion of our Client Solutions portfolio. Within Client Devices, while near term demand trends in the smartphone market are soft. Our view on the longer term shift towards higher average capacities remains unchanged. We achieved excellent momentum in our client SSD portfolio in the quarter. Average capacity for client SSD grew over 60% year-over-year in the December quarter of fueled by an increase mix of our 512 gigabyte SSD at our key customers. For the first time our client compute SSD revenue exceeded client compute HDD revenue. In data center, devices and solutions we have maintained our position as a leader in aerial density with the highest capacity HDD products. As Steve described the production ramp of a 14-terabyte helium drive has progressed smoothly. We are pleased to have commenced product sampling of our first generation energy-assisted 16-terabyte drive and we are on-track to begin revenue shipments of this 8 flatter solution later this calendar year. In terms of the Exabyte growth rate for Capacity Enterprise, as we previously stated we are seeing a moderation in the first half of calendar 2019. Based on our customer discussions we continue to forecast year-over-year growth to resume in the second half of calendar 2019. In Data Center systems we experienced excellent momentum with record quarterly bookings and new customer acquisitions in our IntelliFlash and ActiveScale portfolios. We also had record revenue in our Ultrastar portfolio of storage platform and servers. For the third fiscal quarter demand for our products is expected to be affected by many of the market factors we highlighted at our Investor Day. These include reduced demand for mobile handsets a continued slowdown investments by hyperscale customer’s inventory adjustments at certain customers and geopolitical volatility. To conclude my remarks as we enter the New Year, we are confident in the strength of our product portfolio and our evolving market position. We fully expect to emerge from the current soft market environment in a position of strength and in the near term we are taking the necessary steps to effectively navigate current conditions. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.
Mark Long: Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion at the lower end of the guidance range, primarily due to a decline in Flash, offsetting slightly better-than-anticipated hard drive revenue. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion with a sequential bit growth of 5% and a sequential average selling price per gigabyte declined of 18%. Hard drive revenue was $2 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was 31.3% below the 32% to 33% guidance range due to a product mix for hard drives that included less capacity enterprise products and lower-than-expected Flash pricing. Non-GAAP gross margin for Flash was 35% and for hard drives 27%. Continued focus on operating expenses combined with lower variable compensation in the quarter resulted in total non-GAAP operating expenses of $738 million. And non-GAAP tax rate was 14.5% which was higher-than-expected. We also recorded a GAAP-only charge for various tax-related accruals of $496 million consisting of the true up for the repatriation taxes related to tax reform and future withholding taxes related to decisions about permanent reinvestment in foreign jurisdictions. These are not expected to result in the near term cash payments. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.45. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $469 million and free cash flow was $24 million, primarily driven by lower operating income and a sequential increase in the inventory. Within inventory almost all of the sequential increase was driven by continued hard drive builds, due to the Kuala Lumpur plant closure. In the December quarter, we returned to $144 million in dividends to shareholders. We did not repurchase any common stock during the quarter. However, we did repay in full our outstanding revolver balance and made scheduled principal payments reducing our overall debt balance by $537 million. At quarter end, we had $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and principal debt outstanding of $10.8 billion. As Steve noted earlier, we planned to reduce our annual non-GAAP cost-of-goods sold and total non-GAAP operating expense levels by combined $800 million evenly split between the two line items. For cost-of-goods sold, we expect to see the full results of these efforts reflected by the end of the December quarter of 2019. And for operating expenses we expect to see the full results reflected within the September quarter of 2019. These planned actions are designed to reduce our base level of non-GAAP operating expenses before variable compensation by $100 million per quarter including a normal level of variable compensations our new total non-GAAP operating expense level for 13-week fiscal quarter would be approximately $740 million starting in the September 2019 quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that the September 2019 quarter will have 14 weeks instead of the normal 13 weeks. I will now provide our guidance for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Gross margin of approximately 28%. Operating expenses between $760 million and $780 million, which reflect the normal payroll tax reset and other one-time items. Interest and other expenses of approximately $105 million and effective tax rate of 15% to 17%. Diluted shares of approximately 294 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.60. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: I do have a follow-up as well. Maybe to start given the questions that we've gotten through the course of the last month or so, Mark if you wouldn't mind just addressing the balance sheet concerns, your thoughts on the capital structure, the covenant situation as you kind of look at that threshold of roughly $0.50 a quarter in EPS and any kind of thoughts on how you view the dividend?
Mark Long: Well, I'll talk about the first part and then Steve can talk about the dividend. So in terms of the leverage ratio, we are currently in compliance with significant headroom. And as we look forward we are focused on cash flow and we believe we have the necessary headroom through the near term and through our forecast period. And we certainly from a balance sheet perspective have sufficient liquidity to operate our business. And I'll let Steve talk about the.
Steve Milligan: Yes and Aaron with regards to dividend we absolutely remain committed to our dividend. And so it's as simple as that.
Aaron Rakers: And then as a quick follow-up. I think last quarter you had alluded to the view that possibly the near line, high-capacity business into the CSP's would see more or less flattish kind of year-over-year growth rate in capacity shift. Clearly the result of this quarter were worse the next expected. And so, as we work through the CSP kind of digestion what's your updated view on capacity shipments looking into the March quarter as well as any thoughts into the June quarter as well?
Steve Milligan: Yes just to reiterate our view of the first half is remains the same, roughly flat growth year-over-year. It was our tough compare as you know what's growth resuming in the back half.
Aaron Rakers: I want to be clear there. So flat year-over-year growth in total capacity ship would put you at -- I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but roughly 50 exabyte which is a pretty notable jump quarter-over-quarter into the March? Is that right?
Steve Milligan: Yes. So think about it mark zero growth year-over-year flat.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess first question in terms of your revenue guide. Can walk through how you're seeing contribution between the NAND side of things and the HDD side?
Steve Milligan: Yes. So in terms of the guidance, it's about an 80:20 split. In terms of the delta from quarter - our current quarter to the past quarter.
Mike Cordano: With 80% being flat.
Steve Milligan: Exactly.
Mike Cordano: So the line share the decline is Flash related as opposed to HDD related.
C.J. Muse: And then as a quick follow-up, in the slide deck you discussed price aggression in HDDs and I'm just curious are you seeing that across all verticals? Is that related just a near-line? We would love to get clarification on that.
Steve Milligan: No. In the slide deck it was talking about our client solutions business of that external hard drives. We do not see any of that within sort of standard devices business. The Capacity Enterprise or any of the other direct to OEM businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Just wondering when you looking at the NAND side, if you can give us some color on what inventories look like exhibiting the December quarter versus the normal and same for the hard disk drive as well?
Steve Milligan: Sure. So can you go on mute we're getting feedbacks.
Vijay Rakesh: Sure. So I was asking - just wondering if you can give us some color inventory levels on the NAND side exiting the December quarter and hard disk drive as well. Hello?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Once again, ladies and gentlemen please standby.
Peter Andrew: Sherry, are we coming through on your side?
Operator: Yes. We're coming through.
Steve Milligan: I will restate the answer. In terms of inventory for the past quarter on a sequential basis we grew inventory by a little over $300 million and that was virtually all hard drive related and that was a function of both the bills associated with our KL closures and our return to normal inventory levels for capacity enterprise. So we did not have a significant build from a dollar standpoint in Flash. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown a little over $1 billion, and it's roughly half Flash and half hard drives. And it's basically, the same drivers for hard drives, but with Flash, it is a function of the cycle and holding more inventory. So that's our current position.
Vijay Rakesh: And when you look at demand side in both NAND and hard disk drive, one of the hiccups has been the data center demand has been a little bit weaker. I was wondering, what your expectations are? I know you've talked about that it should come back in the second half. What gives you the confidence that it should come back in the second half given that it's still continues to be at very low level here? Thanks.
Steve Milligan: So the confidence we have is a number of things. Obviously, it's through direct conversations with our customers. It's a combination of the rate of growth relative to their services remains sort of steady and constant. So what they need to do collectively is get through their optimizations as well as in some cases, there are some excess inventory in this system for that group of customers. So a combination of those factors gives us confidence that will see the growth resume for us in both sides of a business and the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: I have one question, one follow-up. Going back to the NVMe commentary and how you're position for new product launch, I want to better understand your value and what is it that you've been able to get some design wins. I'm under assumption that three quarter of the NVMe SSD market is dominated by two and one Korean competitor dominating at least half of the market. And in that context, I want to understand what is it that gives you confidence that you're going to gain traction? And I have a follow-up.
Mike Cordano: So two things. One is the quality of the product we're bringing the market in terms of its relative competitiveness. And you sort of stated one of the other motivations. There is two guys with a lot of market share. They all preferred to diversify. So there is a pull from our customer base on those two factors and they're rather significant.
Steve Milligan: Yes, and the other thing Mehdi that I would add to that is we have to keep in mind that these are our traditional customers. I mean they deal with this across the product spectrum. We are a known supplier to them and so we're able to deliver the right product at the right time with the right cost. We arguably have a pretty good head start anyway given our pre-existing relationships.
Mehdi Hosseini: And my follow-up has to do with TMC in relationship in wafer supply agreement. And I'm just going to ask you and you feel free to how we're going to answer this. Historically you've been obligated to purchase a certain amount of wafer and it's been a cost-plus arrangement. Given all the changes that you're making cut backs on wafer starts and everything and in the context of where NAND process are going and the SSC revenue contribution not in the second half of 2019, how should we think about these relationship? Is there room for realignments of both party would benefit? And should we still assume that the prior arrangements that are based on sustain looking forward?
Steve Milligan: So two things. No. I'm not sure that you're characterizing the relationships the right way. We have the ability to throttle our wafer start levels on our own. Now there are certain fixed costs that they have incurred. For example building, setting up the building, some of the infrastructure costs that we don't pay directly that we are still obligated to pay for. And so we talked about this last quarter on our earnings call when we looked at that from the broad economic perspective from a cash perspective we determined that it was more economical given the supply demand situation to cut our wafer starts which we are doing and are in the process of doing and that will carry you through your kind of the first half of this year and we'll continue to evaluate what level that needs to be. But from your characterization and relationship is not correct. And the economic consequences of that for us were favorable well from a cash perspective essentially.
Mehdi Hosseini: Perhaps a better question would be, will the current downturn, bringing the two parties together? Everyone talks about the need for consolidation. And is this opportunity for a more close relationship?
Steve Milligan: Well that, I'm not going to speculate on that. Mehdi, I'm sure you appreciate that.
Mehdi Hosseini: Would you agree that industry needs to consolidate to better adjust to the industry dynamics supply and demand?
Steve Milligan: I'm not going to comment on that. I appreciate your questions Mehdi, but I'm not going to comment on that. Operator, can we go to the next call for questions please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Hopefully, I got four questions as well. I have two though that I'll stick to. I guess, I'm surprised by the gross margins on the HDD side of 27%, Steve I don't think I've seen that since the time and slot time. So could you just touch on what's going on over there? And how do you see the path of the gross margins on the HDD side 2019?
Steve Milligan: No. Fair question, Amit. And the reality of it is just to be upfront. I'm not happy with the hard drive margins. I'm disappointed by the level there. It's driven by two things: one, weaker or lower capacity enterprise mix, which obviously capacity enterprise hard drive carries a higher-margin profile. And by the way we are carrying a cost burden in the HDD space, which is the reason why we're closing of Kuala Lumpur and not only the reason we're closing it, but also acceleration of that. And so as we finalize the closure of that facility and capacity enterprise are mix improves in the back half of the year, we'll see those margin levels to return to a more acceptable and traditional level on the hard drive space.
Amit Daryanani: And if just follow-up, and I realize everyone’s crystal ball are somewhat cloudy these days. But to the extent you could see and look at all the cost reduction initiatives that you guys have up. Do think gross margins in aggregate to Western Digital trough out of the March quarter and they start to improve for the rest of the year, or do you think June could be another soft quarter before things ramp-up in the backups? How do you think the gross margin trajectory from given all the cost reductions you guys are doing?
Steve Milligan: Well, let me give you a little bit. Let me answer your question. I'm going to broaden that question. So let's talk a little bit about how we see 2019 playing out. So let me talk about the top line first. So we would expect that for next quarter our fiscal Q4 and I'm going to speaking relatively general terms, but this will help all of you. Our revenue levels to look pretty consistent with what we're expecting for fiscal Q3. Going into the back half of the year we would expect that our revenues will begin to improve for two principal reasons: one, improvement in capacity enterprise volumes as our hyperscale customers return to more normal buying patterns and resumption of growth in terms of capacity enterprise. And then additionally, let's call it a seasonal bump in terms of our revenue kind of call it across the board both in terms of Flash as well as in other areas. So our revenue will begin to improve. Now I'm going to start your question on margin for the time being. I'm going to talk a little bit about OpEx. OpEx this quarter in terms of expectations, Mark touched on it is inflated beyond what it would normally be. It's an inflated -- it's inflated really because of a couple of different reasons. Inflated compared to fiscal Q2, because one we've got FICA taxes that kick in this quarter that for a higher wage or people that will kind of go away as we move through the quarter. And then the other thing is that we had some variable comp, credits that were in the December quarter that will not reoccur in terms of in the March quarter. So that's why that compared looks a little bit odd. When you then move to the balance of the year, one we've got operating expense actions that we will be taking that will – the full effect of that will be realized in September, but you will begin to see more of a benefit of that in the June quarter. So OpEx will be trending down as we move through the year to a $740 million level starting the September quarter. After one complexity in the September quarter's we will have 14 weeks of operating expenses versus 13. So we all need to keep that in mind from a modeling perspective. From a margin perspective that is always difficult to determine. And it is really the wildcard. Clearly, from a Flash supply and demand perspective, which is consistent with what others have said, we expect that we're going to continue to be under pressure as we move through the first half of the year. The second half is a little harder to say, but I'm going to tell you what we are assuming. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen, but I'll tell you what we're assuming is that we are assuming that margin pressure in the Flash area will persist through calendar 2019. Now we're doing that for really one principal purpose from a financial modeling perspective and that we want to have a conservative bias, so we're kind of - I'll call it planning for the worst that is leading us to the actions that we outlined from a cost and expense perspective in terms of either accelerating actions that we are already planned or taking new actions to take cost and expense out of our system. But it's obviously not fully within our control to say how is Flash supply and demand going to play out as we move through the calendar year, because obviously we've got demand which there is a fair amount of fluidity and uncertainty associated with that right now. And then, we do not have – clearly, we don't have control nor do we have complete visibility in terms of the production level of our competitors. I know it's a long answer. What that will mean from an EPS perspective is that you – is that probably next quarter will look a lot like this quarter in terms of EPS performance. With some level of improvement as we move through the back half of the year with one exception in that we don't know how the 14-week can we make up for that 14th week of OpEx in the September quarter in other words can we get 14 weeks of sales. That's always a challenging thing that when we get 14 weeks. But that's kind of how the year is going to look based upon our current expectations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Co.
Karl Ackerman: Steve or Mark I wanted to clarify on your - I appreciate all the commentary that you just gave. Thank you for that. But I did want to clarify on your gross margin and OpEx savings assumptions combined equating to a run rate of $800 million. Could you please remind me, how much of these savings are incremental beyond what you previously called out from integrating SanDisk exiting calendar 2020, which if I recall correctly, you expected an incremental $600 million from the end of 2018 through 2020? Secondly, where are the two largest buckets you expect to extract the $400 million of COGS savings from? And then lastly, how should we think about you reinvesting those savings into strategic growth areas of the market? Thank you.
Steve Milligan: So the first question is relatively straightforward. In that the entirety of the COGS actions are incremental to the previously announced SanDisk related synergies. So that will -- we were targeting 2020. And so these are separate from those. And then, when we think about the primary drivers from a COGS standpoint, these are first associated with our acceleration of the KL closure and rightsizing our HDD footprint. And then the second big driver is just an overall focus and improvement in terms of our other COGS related expenses on the primarily in the hard drive side. So the vast majority is associated with the hard drive side. I think those were the main points you asked. Was there?
Mark Long: I think there was a last question which I was going to answer. I have lost. I'm sorry I missed that. There was -- do we cover everything? You have a follow-up there?
Karl Ackerman: The reinvestments.
Mark Long: Where do we reinvest.
Steve Milligan: Reinvestment. Yes, so let me comment on that. I'm sorry. Yes. Reinvestment. One other things we make this point. One of the things that we are trying to do -- obviously, we need to tighten our belts, there is no question about that. I mean, it's a challenging market. Margins have been under pressure. So we obviously need to tighten our belts and we will do everything to do that. One of the things that we don't want to do I've used this phrase before as cut our nose off in spite of our face, right. So we don't want to unreasonably curtail our investments in terms of fundamental technology or in terms of fundamental product offerings. So those are areas where at present we other than trying to push on efficiencies and things like that we're not making fundamental cuts that we will believe will hurt either our short-term or our long-term competitiveness. Now that being said, as market conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate. At present that's what we're trying to do and we believe that we can do that even with the aforementioned cuts that we're making in both cost and expenses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: I guess previously talking about fiscal 2019 cash CapEx of 1.5 to 1.9 and maybe another $1 billion of JV CapEx I assume that hasn't changed I understand you assess that throughout the year. Can you talk about within that budget, what are you planning in terms of wafer capacity additions versus just to kind of more technology transitions?
Steve Milligan: So we are not expanding wafer capacity. So that's all tech transitions that you see from us.
Mike Cordano: And just to address the qualitative side, we do continue to expect to be in that $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion range for total cash CapEx for fiscal 2019.
Sidney Ho: And then my follow-up question is that in your prepared remarks you talked about bit supply crossover of 96 layers in BiCS4 in Q4 of this calendar year. And at your Analyst Day you showed a slide that says cost per gigabyte crossover between to 96 layers will happen sometime in the first quarter in calendar 2019. Is that normal to see a three quarter lack in terms of the supply bit crossover? In other words are there any changes to the technology road map and maybe can you remind us what kind of cost improvement per gigabyte do you expect this year? Thank you.
Mike Cordano: So let me try to answer. That is normal. And that's really the benefit of the technology transition gets you the crossover earlier. But we have to continue to transition the fab to get a bit crossover. So that is standard and normal. And we've talked about this notion of our long-term cost down between 15 and 25. We think this year is at the lower end of that range and is driven as we get more of the production over to the BiCS4 96 layer output.
Steve Milligan: So, going back to the Investor Day, we absolutely standby and – our ability to have the lowest cost per bit from a NAND perspective. So that belief and conviction remains.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Considering the cost-cutting that you're proactively doing can you help us compare to where that kind of gets us from a gross margin perspective or other actions you're doing? I believe last month at your Investor Day you gave some gross margin guidance longer term 35% to 40% if I'm correct and kind of what you're looking at now is 28% so quite a gap. Is there a road map to get back to that or if timeline or given that industry changes are those of the table? Thank you.
Steve Milligan: No. I think as Steve pointed out, we standby our long-term financial model with the gross margins of 35% to 40% for the reasons we stated at Investor Day. Currently, because primarily of the Flash cycle, we are below that range, we highlighted, we will periodically operate below the range and periodically operate above the range. And our actions are designed to improve our cost structure as we said a lot of that is focused on the HDD side of things, but we continue to believe that overtime as the Flash market normalizes and returns to a balanced stage, we will get head back towards our target range. But we haven't given a timetable for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Steve this was one of your weaker free cash flow quarters in a very long time. I was wondering, how you're thinking about the company's ability to drive free cash flow in Q1 and the rest of fiscal 2019? And just how quickly can you work down that inventory from the Kuala Lumpur build?
Steve Milligan: So you're absolutely right. I mean, free cash flow if you were essentially -- well cash flow were essentially were slightly free cash flow positive for the quarter. Right now, I mean, obviously, as our earnings compress cash flow terms under more pressure. I can tell you that what I am pushing the team, in other words, challenging the team is that, I'm going to talk about the current quarter that we remain free cash flow neutral for fiscal Q3. That's going to be a challenge. Certainly, not saying that don't take it as guidance per se. But we are absolutely pushing on cash flow. That is our number one priority. And so we are looking at all the levers we can from an economical standpoint to maintain a free cash flow neutral position from an operating perspective. And of course, that's before any financing activities whether that's payment of our dividend or any debt -- inventory debt pay-downs that we might have. And so we are successful at maintaining free cash flow from an operating perspective that would mean that we'd have kind of I'll call it relatively modest decline in our aggregate cash balance ending in the March quarter. So that's where we're challenging ourselves. But you're absolutely right. And valid to focus on that and it remains very much of a high-priority from my standpoint and accordingly with the rest of the management team.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: The question is on the enterprise hard drive business. Looking at my model, I think units came in at the lowest level since the HGST acquisition. So there's a lot of discussion about the new line portion of that already on the call. But so maybe you could talk about the mission critical piece of that business. I know WD’s prior view has been that's there is still going to be a longer tail of that business and curious if any of the weakness in enterprise hard drives is related to mission critical and how you think your market share of mission critical is trending?
Steve Milligan: No. We've talked about previously. We have exited that marketplace from a new developments standpoint. We are getting near the tail end of our participation from production shipments. So from that standpoint we prioritized investment in enterprise SSD and other areas. So from an overall market share standpoint, we probably seated some market share in the quarter just reported, but that's really about the end of our – our end of life shipment scenario.
Operator: And our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS.
Munjal Shah: I had two quick ones. How would you characterize the inventory in the channel and at the customers at current levels? And then on China, did you see any demands, I mean, what is your exposure there and what type of demand trends do you see there?
Steve Milligan: Let me comment. So I think channel inventories are slightly elevated. And inventory at end customers in certain pockets there's a substantial amount and that's part of the muted demand we see as we came into the quarter.
Mike Cordano: And certainly, I don’t - I mean, obviously people have talked about a softening environment in China in kind of a broad sense. And that's generally what we've seen and it's kind of across the board. I don't think that we've seen anything that is unusual or deviates from that. In other words smartphone guys are kind of enterprise business. So just kind of a general weakness but nothing that stands out in particular to highlight.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Steve Milligan: So thank you very much for joining us and we certainly look forward to continuing our dialogue. So have a great rest of the day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.
T. Peter Andrew - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including business plans and strategies, industry trends, and business and financial outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and we assume no obligation to update them to reflect new information or events. Please refer to our most recent annual financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and Guidance Summary that are being posted in the Investor Relations sections of our website. During the Q&A, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question. Before I pass the line to Steve, I want to alert everyone that, in an effort to provide investors greater transparency into our business and make our earnings-related information easier to find, we've made a number of significant changes to the information in the earnings-related materials posted on our website. All of these materials can be found in the Investor Relations sections of our website under Quarterly Results and Earnings Documents. Please take a few minutes to check out this new material and we look forward to hearing your feedback. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter financials and wrap up with our second quarter guidance. We will then take your questions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported revenue of $5 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 38%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at the year-ago level and, with the help of a capital structure that has significantly reduced interest expense, we delivered $3.04 in non-GAAP earnings per share and over $700 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. While our first quarter results were impacted by declines in flash average selling prices, we experienced strong performance in capacity enterprise, surveillance hard drives, and embedded flash solutions, with each growing revenue over 30% on a year-over-year basis. Current geopolitical and industry dynamics are creating a more challenging global business environment. For example, trade tensions with China, changes in monetary policy, foreign exchange volatility and the corresponding economic impacts are causing our customers to be more conservative resulting in a demand slowdown for our products. This softening demand, in combination with increased flash supply, has led to a market imbalance resulting in a deteriorating near-term flash pricing environment. In response to these conditions, we are making an immediate reduction to wafer starts and delaying deployment of capital equipment. These actions will reduce our wafer output beginning in fiscal Q3 2019. The goal of these actions is to better align our output with the projected global demand for flash. The duration of the planned output reduction will depend upon market conditions and will not impact our ability to meet customer commitments nor will it impede our ability to deliver the most innovative and cost-competitive solutions to the market. Longer term, we remain focused on technology leadership, the broadening of our product portfolio and continued operational improvements. Highlights of our recent successes in these areas include: leadership in bringing the highest capacity and lowest total cost of ownership solutions to cloud customers with our recently introduced 15-terabyte SMR-based hard drive, successful introduction on 96-layer BiCS4 solutions, including our latest SATA-based client SSD and the industry's first UFS 2.1 embedded flash drive for high-end smartphones, ongoing growth in data center systems and industry accolades for our ActiveScale object storage systems – Gartner has recognized ActiveScale as a challenger in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant – and operational improvements that include the rightsizing of our hard drive manufacturing footprint. We remain well positioned to capitalize on the long-term opportunities associated with the rapid growth in the volume and value of data. I want to thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support. We look forward to hosting our 2018 Investor Day on December 4 to provide further insight about our plans to deliver long-term shareholder value through ongoing growth and leadership in today's data-driven world. With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we are taking aggressive actions to align our supply of flash to current end market demand. I'd like to provide some additional insight into our actions announced today. Our immediate reduction in wafer starts and delayed deployment of capital equipment is a reflection of the adjustment to bit supply growth needed to improve the supply-demand dynamic by midyear 2019. The magnitude of these actions is a reduction of 10% to 15% of our planned bit output in calendar year 2019. With these adjustments to our supply, we expect our bit growth in calendar year 2019 to be in line with our view of end market demand growth of between 36% to 38%. We will continue to monitor market conditions and make additional adjustments either up or down as the situation dictates. As we enter the second fiscal quarter, we are faced with a number of market factors that will impact our near-term results. Beyond the flash supply dynamic, other challenges include: we expect to be negatively impacted by the widely publicized CPU shortage. Industry analysts have estimated the PC unit growth will be constrained between 5% to 10% for the current quarter with the situation potentially lingering into early calendar year 2019. We are experiencing a temporary slowdown in Data Center capital spending, particularly by large cloud service providers after several quarters of growth above the expected long-term exabyte growth rate of 40% for capacity enterprise. We are in the midst of adjusting to a more normal growth rate. For the calendar year 2018, we now project capacity enterprise exabyte growth of approximately 55%. Based on discussions with our customers, we expect stronger growth to resume in the second half of calendar year 2019. Steve has already talked about how the global business environment is contributing to a risk averse orientation with our end markets. These dynamics are having a disproportionate impact on certain end markets outside the U.S., particularly China. As a management team, we are well aware of the current macroeconomic and industry conditions and are taking appropriate actions to respond, while ensuring we invest for future growth and leadership across the markets we serve. Examples of our progress in the first quarter were: we maintained our leading position across all the brands in our Client Solutions portfolio, including G-Tech, SanDisk and WD. Client Devices experienced healthy demand in both surveillance hard drives and in embedded mobile flash solutions versus a year ago. Leading smartphone providers continue to increase the average capacity per device, which is driving ongoing growth for our mobile products. Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue grew year-over-year, driven primarily by continued demand for our capacity enterprise hard drive. In addition, we experienced record revenue in our emerging data center systems products, a strategic growth area we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in December. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As Peter mentioned earlier, we've updated our disclosures to provide investors with additional transparency into our business. In particular, we are providing a breakdown of our total revenue and non-GAAP gross margins for flash products and hard drives. These disclosures are included within the earnings presentation available on our IR website. I will now review the financial performance for the September quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 3% on a year-over-year basis and below our original outlook for the quarter. The shortfall was primarily driven by weaker-than-expected flash pricing. Specifically, our flash-based products had revenue bit growth of 28% sequentially, while the average selling price was down 16%. The September quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our Data Center revenue growth continues to be driven by cloud-related storage. Client Devices revenue was $2.7 billion, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We had significant growth in embedded flash and surveillance products, offset by client compute hard drives. Client Solutions revenue was $932 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by the normalization trends in flash market pricing. Non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 38%, down 430 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin declined primarily due to a reduction in flash ASPs. Non-GAAP OpEx for the September quarter totaled $820 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Given the current environment, we continue to align our spending with our top priorities. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the September quarter was $906 million, or $3.04 per share. In the September quarter, we generated $705 million of operating cash flow. We continued to reinvest in our business with $248 million in capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $457 million. In the September quarter, we had a sequential increase in inventory primarily driven by a return to normal operating levels for capacity enterprise products. Flash inventory grew slightly contrary to normal seasonal trends as a result of the market factors that Mike identified. In the September quarter, we returned $711 million to shareholders, of which $148 million was in dividends and $563 million was through share repurchases. These share repurchases put us on target of our goal to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock during fiscal year 2019 depending on market conditions. We continue to believe this is an attractive capital allocation opportunity and demonstrates the confidence we have in our long-term outlook. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling approximately $4.8 billion. Before I provide our guidance, I would like to describe the financial impact of our decision to reduce our flash output through reduced wafer starts and delayed deployment of capital equipment. We expect to reduce our planned flash output by approximately 10% to 15% for calendar year 2019. The goal of these actions is to bring our supply more in line with the demand environment with the majority of the supply reduction occurring by the middle of calendar year 2019. Based on our current plan to temporarily reduce our flash output, we expect to take a GAAP-only charge in the range of $250 million to $300 million spread over the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2019. This charge is driven by our fab capacity decisions and does not reflect an incremental cash payment. As Mike indicated, we may adjust our plans based on market conditions, and this could impact the extent of any charges. I will now provide our guidance for the second fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion; gross margin in the range of 32% to 33%; operating expenses between $760 million and $780 million; interest and other expense of approximately $105 million; an effective tax rate of 10% to 12%; diluted shares of approximately $295 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.65. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and I appreciate the additional disclosures given tonight. I just want to try and dissect a little bit the guidance that you just laid out. Help us understand the variables to consider between the hard disk drive revenue assumptions and that of the flash assumptions. And then also, on the gross margin line, looks like just simple math is that you're able to take your cost down by a high-teens percentage rate on a year-over-year basis this last quarter. How are you thinking about the cost-down equation and what's the assumption you're making for flash gross margin in this current quarter? Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, why don't I let Mike talk about the product side and the cost side first, and then I'll finish with the modeling question?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So, on the cost-down, just as we think about costs, we've talked about the long-term range of between 15% and 25%. We've been operating and expect to be operating near the low end of that. We continue to see that as our expectation, and obviously, we'll update this further with more perspective at the Analyst Day in December. Relative to the product impacts, it's roughly impacted equally on both sides between the HDD and the flash business relative to the impact in question.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so from a modeling standpoint, when you think about the HDD side, the capacity enterprise and client compute contribute to the decrease in revenue. And then on the flash side, we have the pricing environment reducing revenue as well as mobility declines. The margin changes are largely a function of the flash pricing environment and then the lower mix of capacity enterprise on the hard drive side.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Aaron.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. Steve, appreciate the incremental disclosure on the flash side. That's very helpful. Clearly, you're taking some actions here to curtail flash output to be in line with demand. But can you give us some sense of how long do you think that it might take to get the supply-demand back into balance? Sounds like mid next year possibly in the way that you are currently thinking about it. And why do you expect this action will be followed by other competitors versus a strategy of potentially share gains, that is, they keep pricing down and try to gain bit growth as opposed to sort of reducing output similar to what you're doing?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so let me add color on that. Our – the efforts that we're taking are intended to get our supply-demand equation in balance by the middle of calendar 2019. We don't know what the rest of the industry is going to do. And so your comment in terms of why we think that the industry's going to follow, that's not a correct characterization, that's going to depend upon the behavior of our competitors. And so, really, what we're trying to do is, if you want to call it that, get our own house in order so that we are better positioned to take advantage of, let's call it, the long-term growth opportunities in the market. And in particular, to kind of put a finer point on it, we would expect that demand from a seasonal perspective would pick up in the second half of calendar 2019. And getting our inventory situation in better balance will position us better than we otherwise would have been if we had not taken these actions.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, and just to add a little color on that, our costs bring us in line with what we expect the end market demand to be. So straight calculation there is it's obviously intending to maintain share.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And the other thing I would add is there is no intent or implied shift bit share loss in our numbers. In other words, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we still intend to have enough bits or supply to demand our customer commitments. This is really a matter of supply has been outstripping demand for a variety of different reasons. We want to get that excess out of the system and better position us going forward.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the color. If I could really quickly, when you think about the gross margin trajectory here, obviously, the flash margins have been compressing here a few quarters and going to continue. But as you think about these capacity reductions coming ahead, should we expect gross margins to compress beyond the December quarter here like at least for the next couple of quarters at this point? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, it's a great question. And the reality is that, I'll be sort of literal, we don't know for sure. We're going to have to wait and see, but we would expect that we would continue to face a challenging flash market through the first half of calendar 2019. And so that implies that there could be further margin compression, but at what rate, we will have to see. But we don't – these reductions that we're making from a wafer start perspective will not begin to hit just because of lead time for us until the first quarter of 2019. It will primarily allow us to reduce our inventory. And then, of course, we've got the demand environment that we're dealing with and whatever competitive dynamics we'll be dealing with. But we do expect the first half of 2019 to continue to be challenging for us and for the industry.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for the color too (23:22).
Operator: Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Any additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, in light of the wafer start change and delaying CapEx, would love to hear your thoughts on how you think about scale and other factors to enable best-of-breed cost-down in this highly competitive market. So are there other avenues to lift that sort of low end of the range of 15% that you're focused on, perhaps pulling in 96-layer or above or faster move to QLC? Would love to hear your thoughts, particularly in light of six players plus YMTC entering the fold. Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Relative to the cost declines, you're on the points. It's tech transition, so rate in which we convert to the next node, and the implementation of QLC over the longer horizon. That's a bigger lever. The thing we are highlighting in our projections as of now is just the realities of the 3D era, right. They're more capital intensive and the cost declines are going to certainly be less than they were in the 2D era. So that's all part of how the market and the industry is having to plan differently.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And we continue to – because of the joint venture structure and that, we continue to expect to benefit from scale despite the reduction in wafer starts, because it's only our capacity that we're reducing those wafer starts. But if you look at the total output of the joint venture, we continue to have the broader benefit of scale semiconductor manufacturing operations.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryani (sic) [Amit Daryanani] (25:25) of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. This is Amitesh Bajad for Amit Daryanani. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the NAND ASP decline, do you at this point see any risk of you having to cut pricing on the HDD side as well? Or actually, at what point do you think that NAND ASP declines could pressure you to cut HDD pricing to slow down the substitution of SSDs versus HDD?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. I think in the case of relative pricing, that's not the direct impact. It really is the rate of cannibalization. And we have seen that accelerate. We would expect we exit the year about 60% in terms of SSD versus HDD in the PC space.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And just to comment on that because the – as painful as it is, the announced closure of our Kuala Lumpur manufacturing facility anticipated continued decline, particularly in terms of client hard drives. And so that expected uptick in terms of substitution of SSDs for hard drives has been factored into our plans. And we'll continue to look at opportunities at how do we optimize our manufacturing footprint in light of that. But the KL activity, that closure, not to take it lightly, but was done in direct response to that anticipated uptick.
Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. And if I could just have one follow-up. The cost-downs of 15% to 25% range, do you think that could have like some kind of a downside bias next year as you ramp up 96-layers?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: So if your question is a downside bias to the lower end of that range, I think we'll give you more commentary in December what we think next year will look like.
Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group LLP: Thanks for taking my question. This is for the entire team. Inventories have been going up since earlier this year, and I'm just curious how you're thinking about the debt covenants, especially given your guide and your comment about the margin erosion. Is there any of the covenants that would be at the risk of default? And is there anything other than the cost-down, manufacturing cost-down, that you could do to improve cash flows and minimize a downside risk? Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So, in terms of our covenants, through our refinancings and the optimization of our balance sheet earlier in this calendar year, we put ourselves in a good position to manage through volatility. And we remain in good standing with respect to our covenants. And our current forecast keeps us in a good position with respect to compliance. As it relates to managing cash flow, we are looking at all the levers, as Steve pointed out. That's part of our overall review. We look at our manufacturing footprint. We look at how we manage working capital. We look at our OpEx levels, and we are constantly pushing to both manage our business as efficiently as we can with respect to the current market environment and then make sure that we are also investing in the right ways for what we see as some very good long-term opportunities and some very good growth potential on the capacity enterprise hard drive side and in the flash business.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And, Mehdi, just to add color to that, because I think it's important to emphasize, when we looked at the decision to cut capacity, not cut capacity, I mean, ultimately, what we were solving for was what did we think was a better answer from a cash perspective. And that action in and of itself, just as a for instance, provides us with a meaningful net cash positive. And so that is something that we are constantly looking at mechanisms to optimize not only on a short-term basis but on a long-term basis.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group LLP: But what is it with inventory? And it ties into my question, the days of inventory are up 30% year-over-year up and 2% Q-over-Q, and this is kind of the repeat pattern that happens. And I'm just – to understand, as you focus on a cost-down, is there something with the mix or is there something with your inventory hubs that this still needs to be looked at?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, let me give some color on the inventory situation. The inventory is up. It's up more than we want it to be, okay, let's put that out there first. But it's up for three principal reasons. One is is that we have more flash inventory than we'd like, all right? That's why we're taking the wafer start cuts so that we get that inventory back down to a more acceptable level, better matched in terms of supply and demand. So that will be corrected, barring there being other changes in demand and that kind of thing, that will be corrected over the course of the next – well, through the middle of calendar 2019 because of those actions. The other thing is is that we have built up a bit of more inventory, not excess inventory, but more inventory. As we look to close our Kuala Lumpur facility and transition that manufacturing, we need some buffer inventory to enable that transition because you can't unplug it from one factory and plug it into another factory and not lose any manufacturing. You have manufacturing downtime as a consequence of that. That's the second reason. The third reason is that we have largely been running over the course of the previous nine months, let's just say, at very high demand levels in terms of capacity enterprise. And so we've been a little bit, let's call it, hand to mouth without much buffer inventory in terms of capacity inventory. As that market, well, not only begins to soften, but as it softens, we'll see a returning to a more normal level of capacity inventory for capacity hard drives because the demand predictability on the part of our partners or our customers is not necessarily that great. They don't want to go down in terms of having drives, and so we tend to hold a little bit more extra inventory for them in order to maintain high levels of service. So that's in brief the explanation of what's going on with our inventory balance.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Sorry if I missed this, but could you give us a little bit more color on the GAAP charge that you're taking to take the utilization down? I guess, my understanding of the way the JV fab works is that when it's underloaded that you still pay the higher cash cost for those wafers reflecting the underloading. So, can you just help me understand what that charge actually is?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So the technical structure of the JV is not as you describe. It's actually that we make cash payments to the JV, but it's not for the purpose of purchasing wafers. As a result, it's what I referred to as the – we have no incremental cash payments, but we do continue to make cash payments in connection with our JV agreement to basically pay for the CapEx, appreciation, et cetera.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: The CapEx that we have not funded directly.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Exactly.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So they own the buildings. They do that. They have the labor. We have to pay for the labor, things like that.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Right. So this is a true underutilization charge that we are taking. It doesn't have anything to do with the purchasing of wafers.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Munjal Shah of UBS. Your line is now open.
Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. I had a question on the capacity drives. How broad-based is the softness from your end customers? You mentioned outside of U.S. macro impacts, but is it more broad-based on the capacity enterprise side?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So on the capacity enterprise side, it is quite broad-based. We're seeing it sort of across all – our comments relative to China were not specific to the cloud providers. It's really more broadly our assessment of the market in China. So just to separate it distinctly, broad impact on cloud service providers on a worldwide basis. And then the China comment was more general to broad market slowness in China.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Just to add to that, I mean, really, what we're seeing, and I don't want us to sound alarmist, but we've seen other people talk about it in terms of reports in that. The simplest way of characterizing it in terms of what's happening from a broader demand perspective is there's a bit of a risk-off kind of mentality in terms of our customers, end markets, all that. So everybody is kind of leaning out in effect their supply chains. So if you look at the hyperscale guys, they're going to push up their utilization rates to higher levels than maybe what they were operating at. If you look at, say, it's a PC company, they're going to thin out their inventories, our channel partners are going to chin up (35:56). So there's a – but it's generally under this guise of kind of just taking a little bit of air out of the balloon from a risk standpoint. We are doing the same. We are absolutely doing the same and taking actions from a cost, from a capacity perspective, from an expense perspective that is reflective of that environment.
Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC: No, that's going to help. (36:20) And just related, do you think that the cloud customers might have, like, double order? I know you mentioned that you keep extra inventory to kind of provide service, but do you think that they might have given higher forecast or ordered more and that's why you have inventory?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: No, I don't think we have any specific indications of that, but I think, as Steve said, they are taking a more conservative posture. I think in some indications, they are continuing to consume some inventory, but that's not the primary driver.
Munjal Shah - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Any additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. Given what the share price has done recently plus your outlook to earnings, any changes to the way you think about capital deployment for your stock buyback or the early cadence of it or do you need to keep that cash a little more handy for your closing of Kuala Lumpur and your shifting in other business? So just wondering if there's any change in the tempo. I know what you've done historically, that's for sure. But just kind of thinking and getting a pulse and sense currently on the stock buyback.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. There's no change – yeah, there's no change to our capital allocation strategy. As we have said, we have a balanced strategy. We allocate the capital among our top priorities. So investing in the business, our CapEx, and then we look at, of course, the dividend and our share repurchases. We had targeted $1.5 billion for repurchases in fiscal 2019, and as we said, we remain on track for that. So there's really no change other than we do agree that, with the current share price, it is an attractive use of capital. And we will factor that into our balanced strategy going forward.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then as a quick follow-up, you mentioned the word dividend. That was my follow-up, is how should we think about dividend going forward? Do you use it as a percent of cash flow, as a rate of change in earnings? Could the dividend be reduced since the yield is going higher? How should we think about the dividend?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, dividend is a critical part. We're not that formulaic, I would say, number one. But the dividend is a key part of our capital allocation program, if you want to call it that. And we continue to expect it to be that way going forward. And we'll look at different factors and see if we want to modulate it. But clearly, in the short term, we're not looking at anything that would – we're not looking at cutting the dividend. I can assure you of that.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much for the details. It's greatly appreciated.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I had two questions, if I may. The first question is just really perhaps trying to level-set some things on what is your comfort level about hyperscale end demand beyond the December quarter? I think one of your primary memory peers spoke about some challenges in server demand, server memory demand for the first half of 2019. I'm just kind of curious, how should we think about the impact on your nearline hard drive business?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, let me answer that. So, yes, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we expect more robust growth to return to that sector in the second half of calendar 2019. So that's the way we're thinking about it currently.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So the first half will continue to be certainly weak compared to what we saw last year. But that was – the growth was above the longer-term exabyte growth rate of 40%. But we expect this, if you want to call it, stall from a buying perspective to persist through the first half and then resume to more normal patterns in the back half of 2019.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Right.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. I guess, with that demand backdrop, you obviously run a fairly lean operation today. But how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx as the macro drives some lower revenue near term, but you're also going to rationalize your hard drive facility? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So as I think both Steve and Mike mentioned, we are very focused on optimizing our cost and expense structure, given the market environment. As we indicated, our OpEx will be trending down in the current quarter. And we will look for opportunities to continue to improve that and reduce that going forward. So...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: While also making sure that we're not cutting our nose off in spite of our face in terms of enabling our technology and product competitiveness over a longer threshold.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. I appreciate you guys taking my question. Just sticking right there, Steve, if we could, with nearline. Should we think – I mean, what do you think is the wisest for us to do as you think about first half of 2019? Exabyte, should we think of it as flattish? And I know the term growth even though muted has been used. So do you actually think you can get back to a little growth? Or should we think of it as this more flattish – or actually just how should we think of it? Then...
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, I think the best way to think about it year-over-year is very flattish.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it, for first half. And then the thinking is that...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: In exabyte terms.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: On exabyte terms.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: In exabyte terms, Ananda.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Correct.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thanks. And then just, Steve, you had mentioned sort of the risk-off broadly. Is there any way to get a sense of – or do you guys have a view on – for nearline, how much of sort of the exabyte softening is risk-off versus just sort of cycle winding down?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I'm not sure I'm smart enough to dimension that. I'll turn and see if Mike's got a sense for that.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a combination of the two. I think, obviously, there's been a rapid build-out that has been occurring. Different providers have had different drivers of their build-out. So, in some instances, they're onetime things that are sort of behind them. In other instances, as you know, in addition to the risk-off, once they do a large build-out, they'll move into an optimization mode. So there's some of that going on as well. So it's a combination of those things that are really creating the demand environment we're articulating here.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your line is now open.
John Joseph Donnelly - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is John Donnelly on for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the CPU shortage, can you describe how you see your customers positioned? Are they waiting to buy the storage components or is there a potential for some excess inventory to build up there?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Our view of it would be this. First of all, depending on which part of our market, it's not, let's call it, proportionally impacting the market. So it's less in the first year and more elsewhere. And we actually see it as a constraint to shipments in the period. So that's how we are evaluating it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Raksha of Mizahu (sic) [Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho] (44:26). Your line is now open.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Yeah, hi, guys, just looking at the 2019 guide on NAND for 36% to 38% bit growth, just wondering how you spread it between 64- layer and 96-layer.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: We haven't commented on that. We'll give you more insight on that in December.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: But I will add that we are making good progress. I mean, very pleased with our ramp of 64- layer and 96-layer technology. So we feel that we are very competitively positioned in that regard.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Got it. And on the hard disk drive side, you talked about nearline being a little flattish year-on-year first half, but what kind of cost declines could you get – or density increases could you get next year in terms of when you compare to the cost declines on the NAND side?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So relative to the Data Center side of the business, capacity enterprise in particular, we think that cost decline runs roughly at the same rate. So in that sort of 15% to 25%, so it tracks nicely.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to get a sense as to what you felt the new entry Yangtze Memory Technologies' cost competitiveness is relative to your joint venture with Toshiba and whether or not they are absorbing some of the share given the trade tensions that you talked about?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, they're having minimal impact at this point, minimal to no impact...
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: ...both in terms of systems – yeah.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So thank you very – go ahead. I'm sorry. Proceed.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Milligan for any closing remarks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: All right. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you on December 4 at our Investor Day. Have a good rest of the day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, we will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew (00:24), Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Unverified Participant: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our product and technology platform, market positioning, business strategies and growth opportunities, market and flash industry trends, our joint ventures with Toshiba Memory Corporation and our expected future financial performance, capital allocation plans and potential share repurchases. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our quarterly financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 8, 2018. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures, guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. During Q&A, we will ask that you limit yourselves to one question. As a reminder, we are also providing concurrent presentation on this webcast and a PDF of the slides, and our remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of our website along with our quarterly fact sheet. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Peter (02:27), and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full year financials and wrap up with our first quarter guidance. We will then take your questions. Our strong financial results for fiscal 2018 demonstrate the power of the Western Digital platform. For fiscal 2018, we grew revenue at the high end of our long-term range of 4% to 8% as demand for our hard drive and flash-based offerings remained strong. Non-GAAP gross margin improved nearly 5 percentage points to a record 42.5% and with non-GAAP operating expense growth of just 2%, our business model demonstrated significant earnings leverage. The long-term trends of data growth and its increasing value require a robust storage infrastructure. We have assembled a compelling portfolio of storage technologies that address these market opportunities in Big Data and Fast Data. With the continued expansion of our product lines, we believe we are well-positioned to address this growing market opportunity, which is expected to be $100 billion in calendar 2021. There has been much debate among the investment community about flash industry cyclicality and its effects on our business. I would like to share my perspective on it. The tight demand-supply balance experienced by the industry for the last several quarters was driven by several factors including the complexities of technology convergence such as the move from 2D to 3D and then in 3D to higher layer counts. As these technology conversions are maturing and manufacturing yields are improving, the rate of flash supply growth is also increasing. We estimate that in calendar 2018, industry bit growth will be at the high end of the long-term range. These factors, together with a softer demand environment in key sectors such as mobility, are causing flash pricing to decline in a rate faster than in past quarters. The flash industry has been in the midst of adjusting to these normalization trends, and we expect pricing pressure to continue through the remainder of calendar 2018. In this context and in response to the changing market environment, we are reviewing our near-term capital investment plans for flash with our joint venture partner. We are a leader in both hard drives and flash-based technologies and products. We expect gross margins for our flash portfolio to remain healthy. Additionally, our broad portfolio of hard drive solutions, coupled with the underlying growth in cloud infrastructure, allows us to better manage dynamic market conditions. To demonstrate the confidence we have in our business model, its cash flow generation potential, and long-term outlook, our board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. We believe today's announcement is an excellent capital allocation opportunity to enhance long-term shareholder value. We're focused on innovating and executing on long-term value creation strategy by utilizing the power of our platform. I want to sincerely thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support. We will be hosting our 2018 Investor Day on December 4, and we look forward to engaging in a deeper discussion about our market opportunities and how we are continuing to build the company to deliver shareholder value. With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter performance once again highlights the power of the Western Digital platform. Strong demand for our products helped deliver year-over-year revenue growth in all of our reported categories. The transition to 3D flash technologies in the flash joint venture fabs continued as planned, and we made further improvements in our manufacturing efficiencies. In Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand from our cloud customers drove continued adoption of our high-capacity helium drives, particularly at the 12 terabyte capacity. Strong demand for these products reflects the needs of cloud customers to upgrade their infrastructure and build new data centers to support the unabated growth in data. Our helium drives gained further traction on a global basis in both established and emerging markets. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform, we have shipped more than 30 million drives underscoring our multigenerational leadership position. We estimate that the overall exabyte growth in capacity enterprise was more than 90% year-over-year in the first half of calendar 2018. And we continue to estimate more than 65% year-over-year growth for calendar 2018. Switching to Client Devices, we began revenue shipments of our latest NVMe client SSDs with additional product qualifications progressing as planned. In the June quarter, we expanded our surveillance portfolio with the introduction of the Western Digital Purple 12 terabyte drive, which is the industry's highest capacity surveillance-class product. This latest addition to Western Digital's portfolio creates new possibilities in video surveillance by supporting the capture and access of multi high resolution video streams for use cases such as deep learning and analytics. In embedded applications, we saw further adoption of our 3D flash-based products. The design win pipeline for emerging applications in the automotive, industrial and connected home verticals remains strong. In the Client Solutions category, the worldwide appeal of our G-Tech, SanDisk and WD brands continue to drive consumer preference for our products. In the established markets, we expanded our presence in the e-tail channel and achieved better than expected June quarter performance, notably in APAC and China. Last week, we announced the industry's first 96-layer 4 bits per cell QLC 3D flash technology. This new 3D flash chip delivers the industry's highest storage capacity of 1.33 terabits in a single die, reflecting the deep flash technology design and implementation expertise of our team. We have commenced sampling, and volume consumer product shipments are expected to begin later this calendar year. Turning to our flash joint ventures, the ramp of our BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D flash technology, progressed well with manufacturing yields setting new records. The transition to BiCS4, our 96-layer technology, is also underway, and for the full calendar year 2018, we expect our 3D flash bit output to constitute nearly 75% of our total captive bit supply. As Steve described the flash market is continuing to normalize. And in response to these dynamic conditions, we are in discussions with Toshiba Memory Corporation, our joint venture partner, to moderate the near-term pace of capital investments. We are working to ensure that any changes to our investment plans are done with the intent to moderate the pace of flash supply growth without compromising our technology leadership. As we have stated previously, we are continuing to rationalize our hard drive manufacturing footprint as part of our ongoing integration activities. To this point, we recently informed employees of our plan to decommission hard drive manufacturing at our Kuala Lumpur site. Implementation of this plan has commenced, and we will be moving our operations to Thailand over the next 18 months. In summary, with our unique portfolio, we are able to address and capture the opportunities presented by the growth in and the increasing value of data. With the continued expansion of our product portfolio in calendar 2018 and beyond, we are confident that the Western Digital platform is well-positioned to deliver the best financial and strategic outcomes in a variety of market conditions. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter and fiscal year 2018. We executed well across our broad array of markets with our diverse product portfolio, achieved expense targets and reduced interest expense, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We finished the year with a strong liquidity position as a result of improving our capital structure and continued strong cash flow generation. Revenue for the June quarter was $5.1 billion, an increase of 6% on a year-over-year basis. The June quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.6 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our Data Center revenue growth continues to be driven by cloud-related storage. Client Devices revenue was $2.5 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year. We had significant growth in mobile and embedded products offset by client compute devices. Client Solutions revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by the strength of our global brands sold through retail. For fiscal year 2018, year-over-year revenue growth was 8% driven by growth in each of our end markets. This is indicative of strong operational execution and the strength of our diverse product portfolio. Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. Flash average selling price per gigabyte declined in the mid- to high-single digit range on a quarter-over-quarter basis. For fiscal year 2018, our non-GAAP gross margin expanded 470 basis points resulting from a higher mix of revenue from sales of flash products and capacity enterprise drives. Non-GAAP OpEx for the June quarter totaled $820 million below our guidance due primarily to lower variable incentive compensation. Our non-GAAP net interest and other expenses for the June quarter was $101 million, a year-over-year decrease of almost 50%. This includes $107 million of non-GAAP interest expense for the June quarter, a decrease of $94 million year-over-year. For fiscal year 2018, we reduced non-GAAP interest expense, $180 million year-over-year, primarily due to the financing transactions implemented throughout fiscal year 2018. In the June quarter, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the June quarter was $1.1 billion, or $3.61 per share, an increase of 23% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2018, we increased our non-GAAP earnings per share by $5.54, an increase of 60% year-over-year. In the June quarter, we generated $863 million of operating cash flow. We continued to reinvest in our business with $225 million in capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $638 million. For fiscal year 2018, we generated $4.2 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 22% from the prior year. We deployed $1.6 billion on capital investments, resulting in fiscal year 2018 free cash flow of $2.7 billion. In the June quarter, we had an increase in inventory primarily driven by preparation for seasonal demand for flash in the back half of the calendar year. Additionally, hard drive buffer inventory grew to facilitate the expected closure of the Kuala Lumpur hard drive factory. In the June quarter, we returned $586 million to shareholders, of which $150 million was in dividends and $436 million was through share repurchases. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. As part of our continued balanced capital allocation strategy, our board of directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program replacing our prior programs. We're targeting repurchasing $1.5 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months depending on market conditions. We believe this is an attractive capital allocation opportunity and demonstrates the confidence we have in our long-term outlook. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling approximately $5.1 billion. In addition, we have $1.75 billion remaining out of our $2.25 billion of total revolver capacity. As a result, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.9 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our long-term gross margin model should be increased. Despite near-term volatility in the flash market, the power and resiliency of the Western Digital platform remains strong. We are increasing our long-term non-GAAP gross margin model range to 35% to 40% from 33% to 38%. I will now provide our guidance for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion; gross margin in the range of 38% to 39%; operating expenses between $825 million and $835 million; interest and other expense of approximately $105 million and effective tax rate of approximately 10%, also consistent with our updated long-term outlook; diluted shares of approximately $304 million; and as a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $3 to $3.10. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of double click on the NAND flash assumptions that you're making looking into the back half of the calendar year. Can you just, one, help us understand of what a "healthy" gross margin profile might look like in a NAND flash business in total and maybe using SanDisk historical levels as context to that? And what are your assumptions with regard to your ability to take costs down relative to the ASP expectations for the back half of the calendar year?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Do you want to talk about costs and then...
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So the cost declines are within our range on annual basis, so we've talked about 15% to 25%, that's kind of ongoing. As you see in our guidance, Aaron, obviously, we expect ASPs to come down a bit faster than that, and that's what's having the effect. Relative to our flash margins, I think we continue to see them healthy in a context that you just talked about relative to legacy SanDisk margins.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Meaning that at similar points in the cycle if you want to refer to it, we've been able to operate at a premium to historical SanDisk margins. Aaron?
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. And so, I guess with that context, I mean is there – as we look back historically, how do you see us currently in terms of the cycle? Is there a basis for that comment of what we should be looking at with regard to the cycle that we're in and how fungible maybe the capital deployments might be, or the industry's CapEx or capacity growth going into the back half of the year?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I don't know if I know exactly how to answer your question. I mean we are focused on really a few things. I mean, one, let's keep in mind that our business model, our business was constructed to deal with dynamic market conditions. And so what we're focused on are on those things that we can control, what can we do in terms of making sure that we've got the right products and the right customer base, and not only that, what can we do with our cost structure to optimize things and then also what can we do from a capacity standpoint. And that gets into the discussion that we're currently having with Toshiba Memory in terms of expansion plans as it relates to 2019. That being said, we continue to expect that our margins are going to be at very healthy levels as indicated by the reset in terms of our margin model of 35% to 40%. And additionally, beyond that, we have high confidence in the long-term cash flow generation capabilities of the business and also believe, quite frankly that the market is, I will call it, overreacting to the pricing pressures that we're seeing from a flash NAND perspective, and we believe that at this level with the new share authorization, we have the opportunity to repurchase shares at an attractive level.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thank you. With regards to raising the long-term gross margin profile, can you talk about the rationale for that I mean other than the fact that you've operated above that range for quite a while? I guess what is it structurally that sort of makes you think that gross margins can operate over a full cycle in a higher range? Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, the two main drivers are the greater mix of flash revenue which will be at a higher margin, and then the increasing mix of capacity enterprise hard drives. So both of those drive a higher margin profile.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And I guess if you think about – just as a follow-on to that, I mean as you think about the historic SanDisk margin profile, I would think that the amount of capital spending as an industry that we have to do to sort of stay on the same growth profile a gigabit growth profile is higher, should that drive a structurally higher gross margin in NAND as we sort of need to fund a higher level of CapEx to stay on the bit growth trajectory or is that not part of your thinking there?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think we're going to need to get a sufficient return on the capital that we're investing. And so obviously, that is going to be subject to the pricing environment. But our intent would be to work with our customers and our partners to make sure that the capital that we're deploying to provide them with additional bits that we're getting a satisfactory return for that, absolutely. But we don't – I mean let's be honest, we don't fully control that, right, because it's market-based pricing.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. All right. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thanks. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you called out soft demand for mobility. I understand there's not much growth in unit demand there, but I'm curious if you were also referencing any decline in the growth rate of capacity per device.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so relative to that you're right, the unit growth is muted, and relative to our previous expectation, it's come in lower than expectations. So I think that continued unit trend is there, and the unit trend and the capacity mix has been below our original expectations.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Thanks, Mike. And then just as a quick follow-up, it's early here, but looking out to December with price-per-gigabyte declining, do you still expect to see like a typical seasonal move from September going into December? Any kind of pain points in the market that could prevent that today?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, right now – I'll comment on that, and then Mike can correct me if I state it incorrectly. But right now, we're not expecting that. As we indicated, we're – I mean there may be some seasonal bump in terms of demand, but seasonality in our business has kind of muted over time between the September quarter and the December quarter. And we're not expecting there to be any dislocations in the market if you want to call it that would create a different opportunity from a pricing perspective. So we do expect continued – as we said in our prepared remarks – continued pricing – downward pricing pressure in terms of the flash market. And that being said, we'll have the ability to mute that impact because we're continuing to see strong demand particularly for capacity enterprise.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Just looking at the flash side, the NAND side, I was wondering how do you see – if you look at next year as you shrink to 64, 96, do you see the cost-downs being faster than what you're seeing on the pricing side or do you see the pricing stabilize into early next year?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. I think in general, we think the bit growth for next year is sort of the middle of our range, and given our comments, with a bias to the lower end of the range. And it's really about supply-demand balance and where things end. So as Steve just mentioned, it's market-based pricing, and so we would expect our cost progression to be roughly within our range as well. So nothing untoward and really is going to be tied to the supply-demand balance.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Got it. Unless the pricing on the flash side has been a little bit softer, have you seen that drive a little bit more penetration on the hard disk drive side of the business, either in client or enterprise? Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. To this point, it's not been anything material. As things progress, we did see during the period of allocation that we actually saw a slowing of flash penetration in PC adoption. We would expect and we have seen the initial indications of that progression continuing as we moved into this normalized period.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. Steve, the shutdown of the Kuala Lumpur HDD manufacturing and shift to Thailand, how much of restructuring charges will be needed? How much cash restructuring charges? And how much savings can you drive from this move?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, I'm looking at Mark to help with a little bit of color in that.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so in terms of our restructuring charges over time, we're looking at approximately $160 million that'll be spread over three fiscal years. So some of that was reflected in fiscal 2018. We'll have kind of the majority in 2019 and then a little bit in 2020. In terms of – we haven't set out our targets for value creation publicly, but we do feel we're going to get a very good return on that restructuring.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. To add a little bit of color on it, if you look at our hard drive margins and I recognize the fact that we don't disclose our hard drive margins or our flash margins, because it's not necessarily consistent with the way that we manage our business, in other words, we don't have a – we have an integrated business as opposed to a separate hard drive versus flash business, and I do know that some of the investment community wish we did disclose those margins separately. But just to provide a little bit of color, our hard drive margins for quite a while have been incredibly stable, and we have traditionally carried a premium vis-à-vis our gross margins versus our largest competitor. That absolutely continues to remain the case. And what we want to do is we want to continue to optimize our cost structure that allows us to continue to have that strong margin performance. Right now, we have not seen a meaningful degradation in our margin performance, but it takes a while to close the factory. And so, we needed to announce this. We needed to get ahead of it. It's going to take us a while to make this happen and we've been in Kuala Lumpur for 45 years. And so, right now, not a significant impact, but the effect of the restructuring that we'll be going through over time will allow us to continue to operate our hard drive margins at an attractive premium to our competitors.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Steve. If I could quickly follow up, the NAND ASP comment in the quarter of mid-to-high single-digit quarter-on-quarter decline that you witnessed in 2Q, how do you see that trending as you go through the September-December quarters? What assumptions are embedded in your gross margin guide?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, we expect the pricing environment, as Mike and Steve indicated, to remain the same in terms of normalizing. So we would expect the declines to be roughly the same and...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: We would kind of be similar to maybe a little bit higher than what we saw in the last quarter.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yes.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: The other thing to add to that, which I think is an important point to note is that when you look at – obviously, we are out looking a lower gross margin level in our fiscal Q1 or calendar Q3. Largely, that entire gross margin decline – largely, not necessarily entirely – is due to some of the pressure that we're seeing in terms of ASPs on flash.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: No, that's very helpful. And, sorry, one clarification, can you just talk about any potential impact from tariffs to Western Digital? And I mean where your main competitor has some large capacity footprint in China, I was wondering if that creates any opportunity for you guys. Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Well...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, yeah, sorry. How it impacts our competitor, we don't have visibility to that. But, of course, we'll continue to monitor and see if there is an opportunity. We are largely not impacted by the recent tariff actions. If additional actions are taken on tariffs, we could be impacted. But, right now, there's really minimal impact to our operations.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to one of the earlier remarks on where you think we are in the NAND pricing normalization cycle, what is your view on that just based on what is available today? And just going back to Wamsi's question and your answer, if ASP to NAND ASP declines are similar in December quarter to what you think in the September quarter, would the gross margin range – would it be reasonable for the gross margin range to be similar as well? Those two. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think it's a little too early to call in terms of that, but I will – and this will probably be an unsatisfying answer, but there's a reason that we have a gross margin range, right? And so our margins are going to modulate over time within that 35% to 40% range. Sometimes they could be a little bit higher, as we saw historically, and I guess conceivably they could be a little bit lower. We're certainly not calling that, but we have a range for a reason. And right now, in terms of how we see market conditions evolving for the balance of calendar 2018 and then into 2019 is that we are comfortable with that gross margin range as it relates to our business. But that does not mean that we are not going to experience some degree of volatility. And oh, by the way, that's okay. Our business was constructed and our management team was constructed to deal with that kind of volatility and manage it to the best of our ability and generate long-term returns for our shareholders.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. And where in the cycle do you think we are right now? Best take.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, it's interesting. The reality of it is, is that everybody always predicts the end of a recession two quarters late. So it's always difficult to predict it when you're in it, and I don't mean that to sound like a cynic. A lot of it will be predicated on, let's just say, the behavior of others in the industry because we only have so much. We are encouraged by some of the actions that, for example, Samsung in terms of curtailing their investment plans, and we're working with our joint venture partner to temper our expansion plans in 2018. If we're successful in that regard, wherever we're at in the cycle, it will make it shorter, and it will make it less steep. And our job is to do what we can to control and influence our aspect of our operations.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. On the high capacity cloud drives, manufacturing and test lead times are quite long there. So given the strong demand pull from your customers, looking at the recent cloud CapEx spending trends, looks like they're wanting to enter into long-term supply agreements with some of their key suppliers, which is pretty favorable because you kind of lock in pricing and obviously, you guys have control over your cost curve. And so is the team starting to see some of your customers wanting to enter into these long-term agreements with the team?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. I think when you think about our Capacity Enterprise business and those particular buyers, we have a range of different commercial agreements with them, and certainly in several instances, they are longer than a quarter long. And there's different mechanisms there, but yes, I think they are looking to assure supply over a longer horizon, and they're working with us to find the right way to do that that's mutually beneficial.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And then on the flash side, just given the continued normalization of flash pricing, we are starting to see price elasticity kicking in, right, especially on things like smartphones where we're seeing healthy content increases on some of the upcoming flagship smartphones. Are you guys seeing accelerating attach rates to SSDs to client compute?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. As I mentioned on earlier question, we've seen a little bit of the resumption that was really us coming off the allocation period more into the normalized period. We'll see as the rest of this calendar year and early calendar 2019 occur, but you would expect there will be some elasticity there. That's been the case in the past, and we would expect we will see some of it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a problem with unmuting. Just wanted to go back to the increase in inventory this second quarter and is having an adverse impact on free cash flow. I'm just wondering where the rationale is in changing your footprint at this juncture. Would it not make sense to wait until you have better NAND pricing environment and allocate some of that cash flow to a more aggressive buyback given what the share price has done over the past two years? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think that, first off, we talk about a balanced capital allocation plan, right? And let's be honest, our first job is running our business. And in that regard, we are clearly not capital challenged, I wouldn't say. And so right now if you look at it, and I'll just give this as a point of reference, our major competitor in the hard drive space is down two factories. Now we have been rationalizing our hard drive footprint for a while, because we have the HGST and the WD combination. So we used to have four hard drive factories; now, we're down to three. And so from a capital optimization perspective in terms of our footprint, we are not as optimized as our competition. And so we want to make sure that we've got a competitive cost structure in that regard. Now is the right time to do it. We've got things optimized in terms of those three factories. In other words, the capability of the other sites to accept the volume out of Kuala Lumpur is there. We've got a solid transition plan in place that'll take us a little bit of time to execute in a way that is rational and does not disrupt supply as it relates to our customer base. And we think it's the right thing to do and we've got sufficient capital to do that. And oh, by the way, because we can do both, we also think that it's a wise use of our capital to repurchase our stock, particularly at these levels.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. And most of the call has been focused on NAND pricing. Let's look at the half a glass full. You have several new products coming out, the 14 terabyte MAMR later this year, and I believe you also have the high NVMe SSD coming out. Can you give us some ideas how these new products are going to trend? Is this going to be more of a material impact in 2019? Or any kind of milestones would be great so that we could focus on this new product ramp trying to tie in the NAND HD bodily.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, let me – so first on the capacity enterprise side just to be clear, the 14 terabyte is not a MAMR product, but it will be ramping towards the tail end of this calendar year, and we think we are in a good position to continue to maintain our leadership at high capacity – at the highest capacity points in that segment. Relative to our plans around enterprise SSD, as we've talked about, we have announced a high-performance NVMe product a quarter or so ago. We just a day or so ago announced a new SAS enterprise SSD. Those are high performance products, certainly will help us gain some traction within those product revenues, but we would expect the more material capability and impact to our P&L would occur in calendar 2019 as we ramp more mainstream NVMe product. So we're making good progress, but the things we're launching now are really good to sort of defend our position at the highest performance part of the market, and more broad expansion would occur in 2019.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just to follow up on that. You mentioned some interesting products coming down the road, and you also have some other areas where you're productizing your core technologies whether it be spinning disks or flash. Can you talk about how those are trending towards impacting the gross margins, because I assume when you talked about flash prices that was sort of a like-for-like chip base (42:24), those are not exactly with mix included? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think Mark mentioned one of the drivers, or the main driver of our model update was really the trend of both capacity enterprise as a percentage of the total hard drive business, which of course is the higher margin part of that business, and the continued shift to flash as a percentage of our total, as well as the mix of our flash business. Both those things are driving that update in our model.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: And the mix of – when you look within the flash business, is it generally a positive as you productize some of these areas or...
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yes.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: ...is some of them – they are.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. Over time, the mix is positive as well.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And I would also add to that it has a little bit more of a stickiness element to it as well.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much. I wonder if I could just dig back into that enterprise SSD point a little further, which is – I mean obviously, the high-cap enterprise hard drive has been great driving all the growth in Data Center. Do you feel like the lack of – I don't know, I'm not sure you won't say exactly but whatever the – relatively speaking, the lack of growth from the enterprise SSD side which otherwise is a strong business. I mean, are you guys just not focusing on it much because you don't feel like you're there yet with the new sort of internal in-house products? Or is there – or do you feel like your products aren't there yet? Like I know Mike, you said there's more of a – expect more of a calendar 2019 impact from the NVMe stuff. I mean is it just you pulling together the former HGST, the SanDisk, all the acquisitions you've made, all that IP and getting new products out with internal controllers and architecture? Is it just a matter of getting there or is there something else?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So, Rob, this is Steve. I'll take that question, and we've talked about this fairly openly. If I look at our business, kind of scan it and give a report card in terms of execution, our execution in the enterprise SSD area has not been as good as it needs to be. It is a strong focus of ours, there is no question. It has been a strong focus for a long time. We've had some execution issues from a product development perspective. We've talked about those. We've made some changes. We're making some progress, and you're going to begin to see some new product introductions in that area, given some of the changes that we've made as we approach the end of this calendar year and into 2019. It'll begin to have a more material impact in terms of our financial results as we progress through 2019. But that is clearly an area that I have been disappointed in from an execution standpoint, but make no mistake, it is a key focus item for us as a company.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thanks two – as well, if I may. I guess one, Steve, when you talk about moderating the pace of supply growth and you're in discussions with Toshiba about it, how much control do you or both of you really have in controlling your capacity sort of like how far can you push that button? And realistically, are you comfortable ceding market share if the market remains in oversupply mode for multiple quarters?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think that we have – we, with our joint venture partner, have, I will call it, complete control over what we do from a capital perspective. Clearly, we can't control what our competitors do and so – but yeah, we have that lever in conjunction or in consultation with our joint venture partner to affect the deployed capital in terms of expanding or converting capacity in our factories in Japan. Now relative to ceding market share, I mean that would be a calibration point that we would use to determine how much – in terms of where we would want to end up. It's not necessarily the only metric, but clearly one of the factors that we would consider along with what sort of return we would get on that deployed capital is where would that position us from a competitive standpoint including market share. So it's a consideration but it's not an absolute thing that we would look at as a red light/green light kind of decision point.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Understood. And then as we think about flash ASPs and you talked about declining kind of mid-to-high single-digits range consistently in September and December as well, how do you think of cost-per-bit decline? Does that actually start to slow down because as you migrate to 96 layer, I would imagine the cost per bits would slow down a little bit, the declines of that would slow down? So is that the second lever that's potentially compressing gross margin in September?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, cost declines have been – well, first off, let's talk about when we talked historically. We've talked about a range of 15% to 25% and in terms of per-bit cost declines on an annual basis. We've also indicated that this year we expect to be at the midpoint of that. The reality of that kind of getting to your point is that that does not necessarily occur in a linear fashion as you move through a year. And as we move to new node points, sometimes, the cost challenges can be more acute on the front end as opposed to on the back end. And so it may have some impact in terms of our margins as it relates to the September quarter. But we remain, I'll call it, committed or we still believe that cost declines will be in that 15% to 25% longer term and 20% for us kind of midpoint for calendar 2018.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner, and we will have one more question after her.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I guess I squeaked in. I think on the last earnings call, you guys talked about hitting above 40% or 40% gross margins in all the quarters this year. And now, you're guiding a little bit lower than that. I guess maybe what is driving that lower outlook for the second half? Is that primarily related to the mobility that we've talked about? And going along with that, with the lower outlook for the second half of the year, do you still think you can exceed the $13 in EPS in calendar 2018?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So you're right, Sherri, in terms of where we thought we would be in margins and where we are now. It is almost entirely driven by a softer demand environment, particularly in the mobility segment, which is creating a different supply-demand dynamic, therefore pressuring ASPs more than we anticipated. So you're absolutely right. And then I'll have Mark address the second question.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. Sherri, that's a very clever way to try to have us give you guidance for the fourth calendar quarter. But the answer is yes, we will – we're still confident that we'll be able to exceed $13 a share in calendar 2018 EPS. So as Steve highlighted, our earnings power for the platform remains strong. We are going through this normalization period, and the teams and the business model are constructed to manage through that.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then with the buyback that you announced, the additional $5 billion, I know that you guys have been in the process of working down your debt levels. Is the buyback announcement sort of a signal that you feel comfortable with your debt where it is or do you think you'll still reduce some of the leverage that you have? Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. So as we highlighted, we've a balanced capital allocation strategy, and we are still committed to deleveraging as one of our priorities. At this point, we do have more flexibility because we've been able to restructure our debt and we've been paying it down, so we're comfortable with where it is. We expect to continue to delever over time, and as we talked about, we're very happy with the way we brought down our interest expense through our debt restructuring transaction. So we feel like we're able to do both, and we're able to allocate the right amount of capital to running our business as well.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thanks, Sherri.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you for the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit more. I know it's been talked quite a bit, but is the expansion or the ramp of Chinese domestic NAND manufacturing also impacting this or do you expect that to be a greater factor next year?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: No and no.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I mean it's a long-term risk factor as we've talked about before, but it is having no impact in terms of the recent dynamics. (52:13)
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: There's no meaningful output. There's no meaningful output coming from China, I mean. And if there is any output, it's not at any, let's just call it, capacity point that would compete against our products.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay. I was going to say it's also at a lower, a more – a chip – a prior-generation chips too, okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Is that it, Mark?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: All right. So thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we move forward, and thank you for your interest in our company. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now all disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Western Digital Corp. Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jay Iyer in Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jay Iyer - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding our growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies, demand and market trends, our product platform, product and technology development efforts, joint ventures with Toshiba, and our expected capital allocation plans. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed on our Annual Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 6, 2018. Any applicable forward-looking commentary is exclusive of onetime transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that may be announced after April 26, 2018. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled fully our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. In the Q&A part of today's call, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask a question. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. As also a quick reminder, we are also providing a concurrent presentation on this webcast and a copy of the slides and our prepared remarks will be available later today on the IR section of our website, including with our Quarterly Fact Sheet. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter results and wrap up with our fourth quarter guidance. We will then take your questions. We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter with revenue of $5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.63. Our operating cash flow reflected solid execution supported by healthy demand for our products, particularly high capacity enterprise drives, which achieved record quarterly revenue. Macroeconomic conditions remained supportive in the quarter with Cloud Computing and Mobility serving as primary demand drivers. The positive third quarter dynamics included continued strong demand for our NAND flash products. Our results in the March quarter demonstrate the power and agility of our platform and a sustained focus on operational execution by our global team. We continue to pursue a long-term value creation strategy underpinned by secular growth in Big Data and Fast Data applications. Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT applications are fueling creation of valuable data at an unprecedented pace. The number of connected devices worldwide is expected to grow from 9 billion today to upwards of 75 billion by 2025. This exponential growth will require robust storage infrastructures and purpose-built solutions that allow users to capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data. The Western Digital platform is strategically positioned to play a key role in supporting these long-term growth trends. Enterprise and hyperscale cloud customers continue to accelerate their CapEx spending to keep pace with the rapid growth in data, and this represents a significant opportunity for our data center storage solutions. In the Mobile market, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities with our comprehensive product portfolio. We expect increasing average capacity in smartphones to be a continued driver of growth for Western Digital. In a moment, Mike will provide some color on our strong ongoing performance in these categories and update you on what we are seeing in terms of long-term exabyte growth. He will also discuss progress towards delivering high capacity enterprise drives based on our innovative MAMR technology. In Flash, during the third quarter, we saw the market environment continue to normalize with expected price declines. We continue to deploy our 64-layer 3D NAND technology across our product portfolio and will be ramping our 96-Layer technology as planned throughout calendar 2018. I am pleased to report that our joint venture operations with Toshiba Memory Corporation continued to perform exceptionally well, and our plans for continued joint investment in Fab 6 in Iwate remain on track. In March, we celebrated the opening of our shared memory development center in Yokkaichi, strengthening the ongoing collaboration among our engineers. I am excited about the future of Western Digital. The power of our platform allows us to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth, healthy gross margins, and industry-leading profitability. As markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize product and portfolio mix towards higher-value opportunities will continue to be an important lever for managing the business. I would like to sincerely thank the Western Digital team and our partners for their ongoing support. With that, I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. The Western Digital platform performed well during the March quarter. Demand trends in the Cloud Data Center, Embedded Mobile and PC markets were positive, leading to strong pull for our Hard Drive and Flash products. Operational execution was solid, and our responsive supply chain capabilities allowed us to optimize resource allocation and product mix. We shipped a record industry-leading 100 exabytes of total storage as we optimized our output during a period of strong demand for our products. Flash market conditions were as expected, which we have previously described as normalizing. We expect the Flash market to continue to be constructive with the possibility of a constrained supply environment in the second half of calendar 2018. In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, demand for our 10 terabyte and higher capacity enterprise drives for cloud customers grew substantially, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our exabyte shipments for this category more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. Just a few days ago, we launched our fifth-generation helium drive at the 14 terabyte capacity point. Customer qualification activities for this new product have begun, and we expect commercial ramp to begin later this year. Additionally, we have begun meaningful revenue shipments of our midrange capacity air-based drives launched earlier in the calendar year. We now estimate that on a year-over-year basis in the first half of calendar 2018, the capacity enterprise market is expected to grow at least 75%, well above our prior estimate of 60%-plus. We are also increasing our previous estimate for exabyte growth for the full calendar 2018 of greater than 50% to more than 65%. Our long-term exabyte growth estimate of 40% remains unchanged. In enterprise SSDs, our Ultrastar SN200 has been qualified and is ramping at leading Tier 1 customers. This NVMe product delivers best-in-class performance metrics for a variety of workloads. From a hard drive technology standpoint, we are on track to begin sampling our groundbreaking MAMR Recording Technology in the second half of calendar 2018 with a meaningful production ramp expected in calendar 2019. Switching to Client Devices, we experienced strong demand for our mobile, embedded, and compute products. Sales of our 64-Layer 3D flash-based iNAND offerings expanded during the quarter. The design win funnel for our iNAND solutions for the connected home, automotive and industrial verticals deepened, further strengthening our position to capture long-term revenue opportunities in these sectors. Our comprehensive Flash storage solutions portfolio for the mobile embedded market covers a full range of eMMC, UFS and proprietary interfaces for a diverse customer base. With average capacity in smartphones estimated to double every two years to three years, we see continued long-term growth opportunities for our mobility business. From a PC market standpoint, the March quarter was slightly better than expected. We announced our first client SSDs based on new internal controller and firmware technologies. We also announced a differentiated high-performance WD Black SSD for serious gamers, leveraging the same architecture. The expansion of our product portfolio highlights the successful execution of our accelerated R&D investments. In the Client Solutions category, strong consumer preference for our G-Tech, SanDisk and WD brands delivered healthy year-over-year revenue growth for both our drive and Flash-based products in a seasonally slow March quarter. Our offerings for this market continue to garner accolades. In our Flash joint ventures, Fab 6 operations have commenced and we expect initial output in the third calendar quarter of 2018 as indicated. The ramp of our BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D flash technology, progressed further, and manufacturing yields approached mature levels. In particular, BiCS3 yields are also approaching levels achieved by our 2D flash technology. This is a very significant milestone that demonstrates our leadership in Flash technology development and manufacturing. For calendar 2018, we expect BiCS3 to constitute more than 70% of total bit supply and the manufacturing ramp of 96-Layer 3D Flash has commenced, with meaningful output expected in the third calendar quarter. Western Digital's estimate for industry bit growth in calendar 2018 remains unchanged at the high end of our long-term range of 35% to 45%, with our bit supply growth consistent with the industry. Publicly stated estimates of bit growth rates from industry participants as well as market analysts appear to have converged into the 40% to 45% range. The expectations for calendar 2018 bit growth rates reflect the complexities of 3D Flash technology conversion along with some companies utilizing their flexibility to convert 2D NAND capacity to DRAM. In summary, our strong March quarter results reflect the flexibility of our model to allocate resources and supply to deliver the optimal mix of product. With our unique portfolio, we are able to capitalize on fundamental drivers of data growth and the increasing value of data as evidenced by the record-setting exabyte shipments. With further expansion of our product portfolio in calendar 2018 and beyond, we continue to believe that the Western Digital platform is positioned to deliver the best financial and strategic outcomes in a variety of market conditions. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. We executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on the power of our platform, increased gross margins, achieved expense targets and reduced interest expense, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the March quarter with a strong liquidity position as a result of improving our capital structure and continued strong cash flow generation. Revenue for the March quarter was $5 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis. The March quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.7 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Our Data Center business continues to be driven by growth in cloud-related storage. As Mike stated earlier, this was led by strong demand for capacity enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue was $2.3 billion, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We had significant growth in Mobile and Embedded products, offset by client compute devices. Client Solutions revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in our hard drive and Flash retail products. Non-GAAP gross margins was 43.4%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points from the prior quarter driven by significant growth in our capacity enterprise products along with a higher mix of Flash revenue. With respect to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $850 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and short-term incentive compensation. Our non-GAAP net interest and other expenses for the March quarter was $137 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 33%. This includes $157 million of interest expense for the March quarter, a decrease of $48 million year-over-year primarily due to the recent financing transactions which lowered the effective interest rate on our debt. In the March quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1.1 billion or $3.63 per share, an increase of 52% year-over-year. In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 3% year-over-year. As part of our recent financing transactions, we paid approximately $190 million of interest expense in the third quarter that was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter. We continued to reinvest in our business with $411 million in capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $616 million for the March quarter. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we generated $3.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 34%. We deployed $1.3 billion on capital investments, resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $2 billion. In the third quarter, we had an increase in inventory primarily due to seasonality and ongoing hard drive manufacturing transformation activities. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $148 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We bought $155 million worth of shares as part of our buyback program. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaling approximately $5.1 billion. In addition, we have $1.75 billion remaining out of our $2.25 billion of total revolver capacity. As a result, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion of available liquidity. Recent capital restructuring activities decreased total debt principal outstanding by $825 million during the quarter to approximately $11.4 billion. We remain committed to the following capital allocation priorities: organic and inorganic business investments, deleveraging, optimizing our cost of capital and capital structure while enhancing our financial flexibility, and delivering returns to our shareholders through our dividend and share buyback program. I will now provide our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, gross margin of 41% to 42%, operating expenses between $840 million and $850 million, interest and other expense of approximately $100 million, an effective tax rate in the 5% to 7% range, and diluted shares of approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.50. I would like to point out that, based on our current outlook, we remain on track to meet or exceed our prior expectations for revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2018. For calendar 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model. Previously, we had indicated that our quarterly non-GAAP gross margin for calendar 2018 would be above the high end of our long-term model of 33% to 38%. We now expect that non-GAAP gross margin will be at least 40% for each of the remaining calendar quarters of 2018. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wonder if you can give us a little more context around the Data Center strength; very nice number there. But just in terms of contribution to growth, how much came from disk drive revenue versus Solid State Drive revenue?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Mark, the majority of it was high-capacity drives, so enterprise hard drive activity; hyperscale build-out as we indicated.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just as a follow up, with respect to solid state, is the composite revenue of solid state, is that improving versus the last few quarters where it kind of seems like it was kind of going sideways or maybe even down on a year-over-year basis?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Are you talking about a particular part of the market or just in total?
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just in total. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, Mark. I don't know if we can comment. I mean, I know it was down seasonally, but that's consistent with seasonal revenue trends. But we haven't provided specific breakout in terms of Flash-based memory or Flash-based revenue versus hard drives. But we are seeing good momentum in terms of our Flash-based products. And so, things are in good shape in that regard.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just one last question for Mark. Just given the ability now or the flex in the model with the refinancing recently to buy back stock, how should investors think about the runway for stock buyback over the next year or so? Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, in terms of the buyback, as you remember, we executed $155 million of the $500 million that we had announced, and we did that to take out the hedging shares as part of the convertible bond issuance. And the additional $350 million approximately we intend to execute on an opportunistic basis, and this is part of the broader $2.1 billion worth of authorized buyback that we had reinstituted following the closing of the SanDisk transaction.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions, and also congratulations on the quarter. I'm curious on the gross margin kind of trajectory of the business. You guys now are talking about a 40%-plus gross margin. So the first question on that is, should we think about that as potentially raising the long-term sustainable target gross margin range? And then as we think about the mix of the business, particularly around the hard disk drive business, are you now seeing a gross margin in HDDs that is solidly above what the historical range had been? I think was past 27% to kind of 32% range.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so, Aaron, this is Steve. I'll take both questions. In terms of our long-term margin range, we continue to have the long-term margin range of 33% to 38%. Of course, we will continue to look and evaluate whether or not that margin range should change, based upon our experience and what we see from a go-forward perspective; but for the time being, we're sticking with the 33% to 38%. If you look at our hard drive margins – and obviously we don't disclose our Flash-based margins or our hard drive margins, but if you look – just to give a little bit of color, our hard drive margins for several quarters have been very, very stable. And without disclosing the specific number, if you look at this past quarter, driven almost entirely by mix. We actually saw a nice pickup in our hard drive margins and that was due to the strong demand that we saw from a capacity enterprise perspective. Obviously we'd like to see that continue, but we'll have other mix dynamics that will affect our business going forward. But very strong margins in the hard drive space this past quarter.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: And we'll be providing kind of more insights into the long-term model at our Investor Day that we indicated would be in the back half of this year.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And real quickly...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, go ahead, Aaron. But one of the things I wanted to add is that – because I think this is a really important point – is that this past quarter, in my opinion, really is a very strong proof point as to why we thought that it made sense to put these two businesses together. What we've got is, we've got a portfolio of businesses – or of products that allows us to play across various markets. And you see that you've got very strong margins in terms of the hard drive market. We've got a normalizing Flash market, which means that we're seeing a little bit of normalization in terms of our margin rate there. But when you add that up all together, our margins went up on a quarter-on-quarter basis. I think that's pretty impressive.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, I agree. Just to follow on that though is, I mean, as we look forward – and you've consistently said, normalizing. Do we take normalizing as being a view that the company can sustain kind of the implied Flash gross margin? And just remind us on where you stand on the cost downside. I think you'd referenced that last quarter, but I didn't hear that this quarter of where you think you can execute cost down on Flash.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, well, I'll talk a little about normalizing. And my first comment, it'll sound like a little bit of a wise aleck comment, but normalizing means normalizing. And what I mean by that is obviously we were in a allocated environment with rising ASPs and that sort of thing, and when we're looking at a normalizing environment that means that we're going to more normal, more consistent ASP declines like we've seen historically in a controlled environment. So, you're basically seeing even the margin percentage drift down a bit, but in a very measured way. And so, we're seeing a bit of that. We're not alarmed by it. It's still a great environment for us. And so that's really what we mean by normalizing. But as you can see, in terms of what Mark said in terms of our calendar 2018 margins, we're still going to have margins greater than 40 percentage based upon our current forecast, and so that's a pretty good gross margin for us. And so that's a little bit of color on normalizing. And then I'll ask Mike to comment on the cost declines in the Flash area.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So, Aaron, we've talked about, in the 3D era, if you think about on annualized basis, it's between 15% and 25%, and that depends on exactly where the nodal transition is and where we are with sort of capital and footprint build-out. So that's what you should expect, and we remain confident with that. We expect that to happen throughout this year. And a little more color to Steve's normalizing and to add where I commented last quarter, our ASP reductions are largely offset by cost reductions, which does not mean, entirely offset.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: And another factor I think we should just keep in mind is that we get some margin pressure as the MCP revenue increases, which it's doing.
Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thanks, Aaron.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess maybe first one, your June quarter guidance is essentially implying gross margin is going to be down almost 200 basis points on slightly higher revenues on a sequential basis. Just maybe help us understand. I think you were fairly positive on the HDD commentary there. What's driving the downtick in gross margin by 200 basis points while revenues are very stable on a sequential basis?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, it's really two factors. It's the continued normalization of Flash that Steve referred to, and it's product mix, which is higher gaming revenue for HDD and as I was alluding to, higher MCP revenue.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Perfect. And then I guess, Mike, you mentioned potential constraints in the back half of 2018 on the NAND side. I'm wondering, is that a Western Digital comment or is that an industry comment, given I think the 96-Layer transition may be more complicated for everyone? And in that scenario, if it is somewhat constrained, how do you think ASPs will track on the NAND side for June versus the back half of the year if that scenario plays out?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think the way to think about it is, you got to look at the individual market sectors and how they play and the products in those markets. So, it will sort of play by that. And really what we see is this progression and the challenges at an industry level of making the progression to 64-Layer and then 96-Layer. That's all more difficult than was previously predicted such that the bit growth rate, as you've seen over time, has been at industry level being – sort of moving in a shrinking direction. So, it's those factors combined with what we expect to be strong seasonal demand in the second half of the year that let's that possibility be in play. And I won't comment specifically on ASPs in that environment.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: But, obviously, that statement that we could be in a more constrained environment is reflective in the gross margin indication that Mark gave for the balance of the calendar year.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Understood. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter, guys.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Looking into the second half and with your new product introduction, should we assume that the MAMR samples are going to be out? And how should we think about customers sampling? Obviously, this is very critical. And just want to get a sense as to when the PR campaign is going to start and when we would be able to hear from customer and kind of compare and contrast to the alternative technology. And I have a follow-up.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so by samples, meaning we will do that in a broad-based way in the second half of the year. So that will translate to production ramp in 2019. So depending on those customers and how they feel about it, we'll see what they have to say. But I think we'll be very active. We feel very confident in the progress we've made, so we're basically hitting our internal milestones. And the milestone checkpoints we needed to get confident about both those major milestones have been reaffirmed in the recent month or so. So we're feeling very good about it.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then, Mark, you talked about inventory upticking due to seasonality and hard disk drive manufacturing. Can you elaborate on it, because the uptick was very significant? Is there a new product that you're building inventory for, or what else is there that led to this uptick?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, it's really two factors. So, the seasonal builds for Flash and HDD is one aspect of it. And then, the second is what you are referring to, the inventory builds for our hard drive manufacturing transformation activities. So that's our ability to reconfigure our manufacturing footprint and optimize our loading of the factories and our ability to evolve the HDD side of the business, so...
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Is that for 14 terabyte that you highlighted that the ramp just started?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Let me add color to that, Mehdi. I mean, basically what you've got is – you can remember that we – I mean, although we've largely accomplished a lot of the integration activities, we still are working on optimization activities regarding the remaining factories that we have in our HDD space. What that means is, it means reshuffling production around to get the kind of optimum mix from a variety of different directions. At times, that requires you to build some buffer inventory as you ship from point A to point B. That's all that it is.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah, thank you. Congrats on really sturdy results while the cycle kind of unwinds here. I want to start out on nearline. Hope you could put a finer point on where the most activity is today from the perspective of capacity points and how you expect capacity points to evolve over the course of the year and beyond, including your mid-range air drives.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so let me talk about that. I think what we're seeing is very strong growth at the high end, so 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte. That continues on a global basis, primarily with the large hyperscale players. But in addition to that, we see very nice growth at the lower-capacity points, so 4 terabytes, 6 terabytes, 8 terabytes as well. So, as you see more diverse workloads out there, different players optimize around at different capacity points. So the growth is really across the board, but we still see very strong growth at the high end as well.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And along similar lines, the $72 hard drive ASP obviously jumped off the page. There were some (36:02) component shortages throughout the quarter, so I'm curious if you saw those and to what extent shortages either at the component level or the end device level served to boost those ASPs, or is that ASP jump mostly on the natural benefit of rising cap per drive?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so it's mostly on the mix and capacity per drive, but I would describe the overall market as tight. So the demand was very strong and the supply versus demand balance was quite tight.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then, a final quick hit for Mark. If you could just remind us of the jump in the tax rate you expect in 2019, and I'll step aside. Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So we expect the tax rate as a function of tax reform to go to the high end or just above our long-term model, so in the sort of 12% range.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Yeah, just wondering, on the NAND side for 3D NAND, what was your mix on 64-Layer here and where do you see that exiting the year? And if you could remind us on what the cost benefit was with the transition.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so I said in my statement, 70% exiting.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: And the cost benefit was?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: All we said about cost is that nodal transitions allow us to maintain this 15% to 25%. So we haven't been explicit around nodal benefit.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Got it. And I know you mentioned second half 2018 potential for tighter NAND could happen. But if you look at this cost, 15%, 20% down, wouldn't you expect margins to be – continue to trend up unless pricing comes in a bit more? Just wondering – we would assume your guidance on margin is a little bit conservative here.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I don't know if I would characterize it that way. I mean, one of the things is that's part of the normalization trend. We have been operating in an allocated environment. And as we move to a more balanced scenario, we will see a bit of normalization in terms of our gross margin. But, on a collective basis, for the balance of this calendar year, our gross margins we expect to exceed 40% – 40%, or greater.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: And that does not – that 40% rate per quarter does not contemplate a return to an allocated environment.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could maybe provide a little detail on how you are thinking about the calendar year playing out in terms of HD versus the NAND business. The HD business drove all of your growth this quarter and helped you reach the high end of your range. Do you expect the cloud business to continue to be strong through the calendar year, or do you think that NAND business will get a bit stronger as we move into the back half?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so really both. So as we stated on our expectation for cap enterprise, the growth is strong in the first half, will remain strong in the second. That was – really drove our upgraded exabyte growth commentary. And we would expect that the Flash-based product growth will be traditionally seasonally strong in the second half. So, everything we see leads us to that conclusion. I think our visibility is pretty solid.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So in terms of the year-over-year growth in the back half, you would expect NAND to accelerate in terms of the growth rate versus...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: That's right.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...the March quarter? Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much. A couple more, not surprisingly, questions on the high cap enterprise and cloud. So, I mean, a question obviously for – cloud CapEx is booming here, which is great. What kind of visibility do you genuinely have beyond the next couple quarters? You obviously need some for your own capacity planning and whatnot. How do you get visibility and how do you get – or can you get commitments beyond a quarter or two? And then I have one quick follow-up if that's possible.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so, Rob, I think our expression of our estimates for the year would lead you to believe for the calendar year we believe we have pretty good visibility, and that comes from a variety of things. Some of our customers, we have longer commercial arrangements and some we have just more tightly integrated sort of, a view of their demand and their CapEx plans. So, it's a combination of those things that give us confidence in that increased estimate.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: And I would add to that. I would add to that, Rob, that – this is at the expense – I don't want to sound too optimistic, but there's nothing on the horizon that – at this point that would indicate that we're seeing any weakness, if you know what I mean. So there's no kind of storm clouds on the horizon regarding the cloud build-out.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. Okay. Makes sense. And then if I can just ask a quick follow-up. Just obviously the upside in nearline, you had weaker, even in seasonal drives and sort of desktop and consumer electronics. Obviously, there's seasonality there, but was there any amount of you needing to allocate head and media capacity to the higher margin nearline that maybe takes away from it – were you sort of selectively maybe not shipping as much in terms of desktop consumer electronics, or was it just seasonality? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, well, Rob, you really – you hit on a good point, which I was kind of alluding to earlier in that we're going to use the power of our product portfolio – the strength of our product portfolio, the depth of our customer relations to allocate our resources to those areas where we think we can derive the most bang. And in this case, clearly, because of the strong demand in capacity enterprise, we felt that it served us and our customers' best longer term to allocate our heads and media to those capacity enterprise opportunities. So you are absolutely spot on.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Congratulations on another strong quarter. I'm just – was wondering, your projections for a tightening or constrained NAND supply, how much of that is projected to be due to improved smartphone shipments?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So I think from our standpoint, we have probably a reasonably modest view of unit growth in smartphones. What's unique to us is capacity mix. So, we look at it as bit consumption, and albeit the unit growth rate has muted in the smartphone industry, we still are seeing the benefit as we did in the quarter just completed of a better mix. So that's what's feeding into our view of demand in the back half of the year.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: And as NAND pricing has moderately declined, are you seeing an expansion in terms of the lasting demand for the product? Are you seeing some new opportunities come up because of the lower pricing?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: I think what's really happening is, that was – if we go back into calendar 2017, because of allocation, it was actually delayed in 2017. What we've really seen in 2018 as we've entered, is a continuation of the penetration of Flash into certain markets such as client SSD as an example.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we only have time for questions from two more participants. And our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. This is Ada calling in for C. J. You had talked about nodal transitions getting you about 15% to 25% cost reductions. Can you talk about how that changes as you get past 96-Layer and as QLC enters the mix?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So in general, we see that 15% to 25% to be a long-term cost reduction forecast in the 3D era, including QLC.
Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. And then, in terms of your JV with Toshiba, are there any implications for the JV if the sale to the Bain consortium doesn't go through?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: The short answer is, no. When we constructed our, if you want to call it settlement agreement, it was constructed with the intent that it simply protected our long-term interest effectively, no matter who the buyer or owner was of the asset – of the TMC asset. So, we're not affected one way or the other in that regard.
Ada Menaker - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on strong results. I guess two for me. The first is just a clarification. I believe that the past couple quarters, at least quarter-and-a-half, you guys had talked about cost offsetting NAND price declines such that you expected gross margins to be stable. And I just wanted to see if you're altering that outlook at all here. Then I have a quick question after that. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So, what we've said previously as we talked about the normalizing market was that the cost declines would largely offset the ASP declines. And that's what we've seen.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. So, no change in what you were expecting and (46:52)?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, just for clarification, largely does not mean entirely.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just my question would be, with regards to NAND supply constraint potential in the second half of the year – and this is particularly because of the comments that Mike made that it's not baked into the gross margin thought process right now; it's incremental if it happens (47:15). Can you just walk us through what you see – I know you touched on one or two, but can you walk us through what all the signposts could be as you see them that could lead to a supply constrained environment in the second half? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, so signpost number on, we've already talked about, which is our expectation for bit growth at a industry level, which has been coming down sort of quarter-over-quarter in terms of the estimate for the year. So that combined with what we think the demand side's going to look like. So I think we will see – actually see more clearly in the coming months. But I think there remains that possibility. And obviously at this point, for the majority of our business, we are still not booked out in the second half of the year. So as we progress through this quarter, we'll have a better feel.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Okay. All right, thank you. So thank you everybody for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital's Second Fiscal Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operation Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you, Stephen, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies, demand and market trends, our product portfolio and product development efforts, our plans to deleverage optimize our capital structure and reduce certain cost and expenses, the expected impact of the Tax Cuts and job Act, our joint ventures with Toshiba and our long-term access to Flash. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-Quarter filed with the SEC on November 07, 2017. Any applicable forward-looking commentary is exclusive of one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions that may be announced after January 25, 2018. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their question. I thank you in advance for your cooperation. I also want to note that we are displaying a PowerPoint deck during today’s commentary and that a PDF of the slides in our remarks will be available later today on the IR section of our website along with our quarterly factsheet. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Steve Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions. We demonstrated the power of our platform with record non-GAAP financial results in the December quarter. I am very pleased that we achieved a year-over-year revenue growth in each of our end market categories. We reported revenue of $5.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95. We once again generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets most notably for capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products. Entering the new calendar year, there are several noteworthy trends as we pursue our long-term value creation strategy. The global economic environment is healthy; the GDP growth rates in the U.S., China and the EU are positive, portending significant IT spending. Data has been created at a record pace worldwide and the value of data is increasing too driven by advancements in mobility, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The unabated growth in data is creating a global need for a larger and more capable storage infrastructure. The level of CapEx spending by cloud service providers to accommodate this growth is robust. As Michael addressed in more detail, the healthy pace of data center build out has resulted in a recent reacceleration of demand for a high capacity enterprise hard drives. Against this backdrop, we are well positioned with our powerful platform to enable our broad customer base to capture, preserve, access and transform an ever increasing diversity of data. The flash market is normalizing in a constructed manner as a diversified value-added storage solution provider with a wide breadth of serve markets; we will continue to demonstrate resilience of our model by delivering compelling financial results. I am very pleased with our progress in technology and product development. The deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND technology continued across our product portfolio and we will be ramping our 96-layers technology later this calendar year. We continue to lead the industry with our high capacity helium platform and we remained on plan to sample our MAMR-based capacity enterprise hard drives in the second half of calendar 2018. It was gratifying at the end of the calendar year with a resolution of our negotiations with our JV partner Toshiba to extend and strengthen our relationship and ensure our long-term access to flash and I am happy to report that our JV operations continue to perform very well. I am very proud of our team driving and focus on execution and the results they have delivered. With that, I will ask Mike to share the business highlights.
Mike Cordano: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased that we finished calendar 2017 with strong December quarter results. We executed well across our business with continued strength and demand for our products and solutions. As Steve indicated, we saw year-over-year growth in each of our end market categories, reflecting our power of our platform and addressing a broadening set of markets and customers. In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven most notably by demand for our embedded flash and client SSD products. We began shipments of our 3D flash-based embedded solutions with a mobile and compute market including our first USF offering allowing us to address our broader market opportunity beginning this calendar year. In addition, we saw continued strong demand for our products and growth areas, such as connected home, surveillance and industrial verticals. Solid year-over-year revenue increases in Client Solutions highlighted the continued preference for our G-tech, SanDisk and WD brands during the strong holiday season. We made further end roads in our engagement with leading brick-and-mortar and e-tail partners during the December quarter. At CES earlier this month, our products received half a dozen awards, underscoring the ongoing innovation and differentiated value we are delivering to this market. In Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand for capacity enterprise drives remains strong. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives grew further and the transition to the 12 terabyte capacity point accelerated. We also began shipments of our industry leading 14 terabyte drives, for hyperscale applications during the December quarter. In terms of exabyte growth in capacity enterprise, as previously indicated, calendar 2017 was the slower period for the market, primarily due to industry-wide component constraints, with an overall exabyte growth rate of slightly less than 30%. However, as we noted in our December conference call, we saw strengthening demand for capacity enterprise drives, as we ended 2017. In the first half of calendar 2018, we estimated that the year-over-year industry exabyte growth rate will exceed 60% as the pent-up demand is fulfilled. For the full calendar 2018, we estimate exabyte growth to exceed 50%, as broad deployments of capacity enterprise drives are expected to persist throughout the year. Data center build out by several large hyperscale customers and guided industrial policies are driving significant global infrastructure expansion. These trends are leading to a growing need for capacity enterprise drives in the high end as well as the mid range. Western Digital, the mid range part of the capacity enterprise market has been an area of lower exabyte share. We have responded to the rising demand for 4 terabyte to 5 terabyte capacity drives, especially in Asia, with our recent introduction of a new range of cost-advantages, air based products. We expect the demand for high and mid range capacity drive to support the higher rate of exabyte consumption in calendar 2018, and our long-term annual exabyte growth estimate is unchanged at 40%. From an operational standpoint, we expect to achieve further cost and expense reductions, as the hard drive market continues to evolve. For example, we have reduced development expenses in our product portfolio by eliminating future investments and performance enterprise drives and narrowing our client HTD portfolio. Additional actions include our previously announced closures of manufacturing operations in China and Singapore. Turning to flash joint venture, the ramp of our 64 layer 3D flash technology, BiCS3, progressed well with further improvements in yields and productivity. The mix of our 3D flash bit supply approach 70% exceeding the December quarter with BiCS3 constituting more than 90% of 3D flash bits. Additionally, we commenced initial production of our 96-layer technology BiCS4 and began product shipments to retailers in the December quarter. We expect to ramp BiCS4 in the second half of the calendar year. From a fab standpoint, as we had announced in December, we will begin our participation in Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche. Fab 6 operations are expected to commence in the next few months with our initial bit output in the third calendar quarter of 2018. From a flash industry perspective, we estimate bit growth in calendar 2017 was at the low end of the long-term range of 35% to 45% with Western Digital’s growth somewhat higher than the industry given a relative strength in 64-layer 3D flash. In calendar 2018, we estimate industry bit growth to be near the high end of the long-term range due to improving manufacturing yields and continued transition to 3D flash with our growth consistent with the industry. Before I conclude, let me note that the normalization in flash markets is both expected and beneficial for the industry, creating new opportunities for flash. In fact extended periods of supply constraints limit market adoption and the pace of innovation. We view this normalization as a part of our business and it is our objective to leverage the strength and breadth of our portfolio to drive the best business outcome in a variety of market condition. In calendar 2018, we expect the Western Digital platform to strengthen further from the planned launches of several new products and solutions and I look forward to providing you further updates in the months ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussions.
Mark Long: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I’m very pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of market as we capitalize on our diverse product portfolio, increase growth margins and achieved cost and expense target. All of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the December quarter with a strong liquidity position, as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation and we made progress on deleveraging and improving our capital structure. We had record revenue for the December quarter of $5.3 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion. Client Devices was $2.6 billion and Client Solutions was $1.3 billion. Our Data Center business continues to be fueled by cloud related storage demand. Our December quarter revenue for the Data Center Devices and Solutions increased 3% year-over-year. We saw significant growth from capacity enterprise hard drives, which was partially offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the December quarter increased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility, client SSDs and surveillance products. Client Solutions revenue for the December quarter, increased 17% year-over-year mostly as a result of the strength and reach of our valuable global retail brands. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2% up 655 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply demand environment for flash-based products. Cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue. With respect to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $865 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and the first full quarter of operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. As described in our December call, our operating expenses are higher than our October guidance driven entirely by the over achievement on our six months variable compensation plan. Our non-GAAP net interest and other expense for the December quarter was $180 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 19%. This includes a $197 million of interest expense for the December quarter, a decrease of $8 million year-over-year primarily from the re-pricing of our debt and the retirement of our euro term loan deep, partially offset by increases in LIBOR, which were approximately 70 basis points on a weighted average basis. Let me explain the impact of the recent tax reform on Western Digital. We will benefit from the new tax law by having the ability to access our global cash in the U.S. in a highly efficient manner. As a result, we will have greater flexibility with respect to our overall capital allocation and investment decision. In the December quarter, we booked a provisional net tax charge of $1.6 billion due primarily to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, which is included only in our GAAP results. The payment of this repatriation tax will be spread over the next eight years, which is expected to begin in fiscal 2019 with approximately 60% due in the last three years of the period. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be at the high end or slightly above our long-term guidance of 7% to 12%. In the December quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 4% which was lower than our expectations because of the new tax legislation which resulted in a reduced U.S. corporate tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $1.2 billion or $3.95 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $823 million or $2.78 per share driven by the one-time net charge related to tax reform. A GAAP net loss for the period also includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. The net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP result is primarily due to charges that have no cash impact within the quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continued to reinvest in our business with $629 million in capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $553 million. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 54% year-over-year. We deployed $915 million on capital investments resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $1.4 billion. We paid the previous declared cash dividend totaling $148 million further during the quarter and also declared the dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalence and available for sales securities totaling $6.4 billion resulting in approximately $7.9 billion of available liquidity including our $1.5 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We repaid our euro term loan B in full and our net debt has decreased approximately $500 million to $5.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to the following capital allocation priorities. Organic and inorganic business investments deleveraging, optimizing our cost of capital and capital structure while enhancing our financial flexibility and delivering returns for our shareholders through our dividend and reauthorize share buyback program. We achieved our planned cost and OpEx synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations within the expected timeframes. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. While we have achieved our synergy target as of the end of the calendar 2017, we will continue to deliver and expense benefits from both of these transactions over the coming years. I will now provide our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be approximately $4.9 billion consistent with a seasonally weaker fiscal third quarter. Gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. Operating expenses to be between 840 and $850 million which includes the annual payroll tax reset. Interest and other expense to be between 180 and $185 million. The effective tax rate in the 5 to 7% range and our diluted shares to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.30. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth, profitability and value creation through industry cycles. While we expect to see normal seasonality in the second half of fiscal 2018, we continue to see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4 to 8% for fiscal 2018. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be between $13.50 and $14 for fiscal 2018. For calendar 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth at the high end of our long term model. We also expect that non-GAAP gross margin will be above the high end of our long-term model range of 33% to 38% throughout the year. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: I want to start-off with the longer term question. In the past year, we were destructed by Toshiba. Now that looking forward, I would like to revisit your longer term method that you presented at Analyst Day December of 2016 has been a while. How should we think about those longer term growth and longer term objectives beyond the next few quarters? Is there any change -- is there any change in the strategy? And how do you see the Company evolving with the next few years especially in the context of updating us since you've been kind of absent over the past year or so?
Steve Milligan: Yes so, Mehdi, I would say that there has essentially been no fundamental change to our long-term strategy since we had our Analyst Day and growth rates from an industry perspective, from our perspective remained consistent. We constantly think about, how the market is evolving and changes and relook at our strategy, but I would say that right now there is no real fundamental change. One other thing that we are contemplating is, does it make sense to have in Investor Day coming up here in the fall. We haven’t made a formal decision on that, but we will certainly from an internal perspective be refreshing our view on everything and providing appropriate updates to our investor base. But as a general statement, there has been no fundamental or big change to either our strategy or the fundamentals as we saw them at our Investor Day.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. But when I look at your segment information especially for December quarter, your Client Devices on a Q-over-Q basis to me was a little below expectation, it was down 1%, and your data center, you have to understand you may have been constrained by NAND shortage. But it doesn’t show the kind of scaling that I thought it would happen maybe 18 months after acquisition of SanDisk, and this is why I was asking for an update. So, is there -- with the Toshiba overhang distraction had an impact? If not, how come we're not seeing the kind of outperformance that should have happened by now?
Steve Milligan: Well, I am not quite sure what numbers you are referring to. So I think we should probably take that offline and maybe dive into it a little bit. But fundamentally I think that, we’re pleased. As Mike indicated, I’ll comment on two things. One, if you want to call being a slight negative in that universe of expectation that we had capacity enterprise, last year grew a little bit less than what we had anticipated, that’s a short-term statement. We talked about the reacceleration that was seemed here in the first half and through calendar 2018. So I would say that our data center and devices business kind of grow a little bit less than what we would expect longer term. On the positive side, Client Solutions which is a market segment that we had expected to kind of modestly decline over a period of time actually saw extraordinary growth, really speaking to the strength of our market position, the strength of our products or brands, et cetera. So, there is always going to be puts and takes within the particular segment. But on balance I have to say that I am very pleased with the way that the last 12 years, there was no Toshiba overhang from an execution perspective, and as I said, I am extremely proud of what our people have accomplished both from an operating and from a financial perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, if I can, one quick housekeeping question and then one other question. Can you just talk a little bit about where you stand today as far as debt to adjusted EBITDA? And how that relates to your capital return strategy? And then the question is and I’m just curious, if you could address the enterprise SSD market? It didn’t hear a lot about that during the script of the call. I’m just curious of how you characterize your performance there, and if there is anything that we should think about going forward that might change the trajectory of that business?
Steve Milligan: Yes, let me take the enterprise SSD question first. So I think as we’ve stated our product portfolio is sort of execution and expansion would happen in 2018 largely and then also towards the mid to second half of ’18. So we are continuing to hold serve if you will, but we have more to do at the product level that we expect will become more meaningful, as the year progresses for the mid part of the year summer and beyond.
Mark Long: Yes, with respect to our debt-to-EBITDA, in terms of the way our EBITDA is calculated under our debt instruments, we are now below two times debt-to-EBITDA. So we’re in a very good position, we have achieved a level that gives us strong flexibility in terms of what we want to do from a capital allocation standpoint and we will be evaluating our top priorities and kind of executing accordingly overtime.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: I have a question and a follow-up as well. Maybe we’ll start on the flash side, I think you guys mentioned industry and your bit growth would be at the high end of this 35% to 45% range. That seems fairly in line with, I think, a lot of peers are saying. I’m just wondering though, how do you think of cost per bit decline trajectory as you go through that high end of that range, if you may? And if we do have normalization as you characterize in the flash market in ’18. What do you think that does to your gross margin structure? Does that -- is normalization a stable driver, outside driver or downside driver to your gross margin?
Mike Cordano: Yes, so we’ve talked about in this new 3D regime, the sort of way to think about annualized cost reduction is approximately 20% per year. I think in our previous call, we talked about our view of the environment is such that ASP declines, if you're seeing some up are largely offset by cost declines. We see that happening in the current period and we expect that to happen going forward.
Steve Milligan: Right, and as I indicated in my guidance for the calendar a year, as a result that’s what gives us confidence that we will operate above our total gross margin model of 33% to 38% for the entire year.
Amit Daryanani: And if I could just follow up Mark, OpEx of March quarter slightly higher than I think what most of us were modeling. I’m just wondering, how much of the payroll tax reset driving that in the March quarter? And then just broadly, how do I think about OpEx through calendar ’18 for you guys as a range?
Steve Milligan: Good question. So, the rest for payroll tax is something on the order of $15 million or $17 million. And as a result, you can think about a -- I think what we talked about in terms of an $830 million kind of baselines quarterly run rate that we expect to decline and we have the number of activities ongoing to enhance efficiencies, so that that will decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan: Steve, I was wondering, you spoke about this pretty strong global economic backdrop to data center build out. Obviously, you are guiding on both the high capacity drives as well as NAND on the upside of these ranges. On the NAND side, the 35 to 45 range that you have for bit growth, how much of that is based on this improving economic backdrop? Or are you building in any elasticity of demand once you see this price normalization? And I have a follow-up.
Steve Milligan: Well, I'll answer the question this way. We have been saying and anticipating that the industry is going to grow at that high end of that 35% to 45% range for a while. And so, it really is more of a longer term statement as opposed to something that has changed over the last three to six months because of macroeconomic environment or something like that. And so, it takes a while that we think long-term plan and so we have seen the investment levels be pretty consistent with the growth levels. The one thing that we have seen recently that is an interesting dynamic is some companies that one are in the DRAM market as well as the NAND market, and then have the flexibility to convert 2D NAND to DRAM, they appeared to be doing that more so. So relative to that 35% to 45% or at that high end, there appears to be a little bit more of a downside by to that as opposed to about that it would exceed that. So we are beginning to see that kind of come down a bit, which is obviously good from a NAND perspective, right.
Mike Cordano: Right, the other thing I'll comment on as we look at the demand side of equation sort of expected capacity upgrades as we progress through the year, and how they translate through the demand cycle for NAND, we think that those numbers, not only are we in sort of a constructive period. As we see the year, we have the possibility of getting into a more constrained environment in the second half of the year.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks, I appreciate that color and I try to quickly follow up. You spoke about this hyperscaler pick up. Any color geographically where you are seeing the most activity in the first half of 2018? And what is the average capacity of the drives of these hyperscalers?
Steve Milligan: Yes. So, I think we are seeing strong demand domestically as well as certainly in China that would be the one would stick out to us. Yes, I think and if you look at the capacity point is that general statement, the domestic relative to us here in the U.S., they send to take a highest cap drives. In China, they don't always necessarily take the highest cap drives that then speaks to this area where we had a bit of hole in our product portfolio in terms of 4 to 8 terabyte in air products, which we recently introduced in the air of cost competitive product that will help to better address that portion of the market at least vis-à-vis our product portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Just one or two around gross margins, SEC gross margin, if I could. Just have to clarify, I believe the comment around SEC gross margin in December, was that you guys just hold them flattish, and in flattish I might be paraphrasing, but I think that was the spirit of it. Does that still hold? I just want to check that. And then, what are you guys anticipating for a NAND ASP declines through this year? And I have a quick follow-up on gross margin there. Thanks.
Mark Long: Well, as you can see, our guidance for the quarter for the total gross margin is 42% to 43%. So, we’re looking at very small changes in gross margin and I think it's -- we are seeing as Mike pointed out, some normalization in the flash market, but it's mostly offset from an ASP decline standpoint by the cost declines and as a result our gross margins are healthy.
Steve Milligan: Or relatively stable.
Ananda Baruah: I apologize. I was actually referring to the calendar year ’18 guide.
Mark Long: Yes, so what we’re seeing, I think in December where we talked about was being in a position where we would maintain total gross margins above the long-term range that we’ve talked about, and that’s certainly the case with respect to the trajectory of flash gross margins. I think the latest commentary I think you heard from Mike suggests that -- again while we may have some declines in gross margin -- remember some of declines in our total gross margin are also going to be a function of the seasonally weaker first half of the calendar year. And then in terms of the visibility in to the back half, as Mike pointed out, the gross margin trajectory will be a function of on the flash side how much this tightness in the market materializes. So, at this point, we continue to feel that it is a constructive market and as Mike pointed out there is this potential for tightening which would certainly have a positive effect on gross margin.
Ananda Baruah: What’s your sort of base case expectation for NAND ASP declines for calendar ’18?
Mark Long: We haven’t disclosed that.
Steve Milligan: Yes, the only thing we’ve said around that is, our expectation would be that the ASP declines would be largely offset by our cost declines and that gives you an idea.
Mike Cordano: Yes, with cost declines being in the 20% range.
Ananda Baruah: Right, okay. Is there any reason to think you’ll be tremendously different from past cycles ASP declines?
Steve Milligan: Well, I think if you look at it that part of what we’re saying is that, yes, it will be different than past cycles, in a positive way, and we try to talk to it and explain it as best to our ability, but it’s a bigger market. So the incremental impact of capacity additions, I think that you are seeing also to some degree that’s conversion from 2D NAND and the DRAM and that’s moderating and I think you are just seeing a more rational set of behaviors economically focus that is resulting and still from volatility but not the same level of volatility that has been seen in the past.
Mark Long: And the maturity of the end market so the secular trends for demand remained strong and I think as Mike highlighted some normalization of the NAND market is actually very healthy because it will open new markets and it will increase demand in those mature markets to the extent of price sense. So we feel that calendar 2018 is a very constructive period and as Steve was highlighting, there were dynamics both on the supply side and on the demand side that you can just go and apply the patterns from previous cycles and think you are going to really get the right outcome for this period.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Your line is open.
Stanley Kovler: I just wanted to clarify some of the trends in the near line market. So how should we think about the impact of mix? You've talked about selling more mid range drives versus high end and as we think about the entire near line revenue line within your HDD mix, especially going into the first half of the year. Could you remind us the levers there on gross margin between overall HDD volumes for you guys versus mix near line shipment to 60% there? And I have a follow up. Thank you.
Steve Milligan: Yes. So I think the thing to think about is it’s a more diverse market now. So we're -- certainly, we have been focusing our strategy at the highest capacity drive, which remains a robust part of the market. We are now seeing demand across our range of capacities, so from a unit volume perspective, that helps, right. The way to think about leverage through our model though is ultimately about our component utilization. So, when you think about it most for CapEx on the drive side is tied up in heads and media manufacturing, and whether we can figure those as 12 or 14 terabytes or 8, the combination of those to get to the expected exabyte growth rate remains fairly common. So you are modeling just on contemplate different unit volume scenario than just as sort of historical view to the high cast.
Stanley Kovler: So when I think about the volume impact there versus the overall portfolio coming down. Can you help me understand how the mix shift is going to improve overall ASP as well?
Mark Long: So, we do expect overall ASPs to benefit from a mix standpoint on the HDD side and we as a result, you know we know we have the -- we’ll have some volume declines from a seasonal standpoint and parts of the business. We do -- we see relatively stable gross margins.
Stanley Kovler: If I could ask a separate follow-up on more related to cash, you authorized or I should say reauthorize the buyback program back in November. And then if I look at the outlook for the share count looks about flattish with the current quarter. What are you contemplating in terms of share repurchases there?.
Steve Milligan: Yes, we have not made any public statements about our repurchase plans at this point.
Stanley Kovler: Any sense of timing on that to just provide an update or use of cash?
Mike Cordano: I think we’ve already indicated our priorities. I mean and I don’t want to go through what was already read, but first thing as we invest back in our business, optimize our capital structure, deleverage and repurchases on that list, and it will be contemplated with the a broader set of capital allocation considerations, as we look to drive longer term value creation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Robert Cihra: A clarification and although one question, if that’s alright. The clarification just in your slide you’ve briefly mentioned, and if there is no more development or point back development on performance drives and so, is that like stopping development on 10-K? And does that mean they go end of life or they go end of life at one point or is it just pulling back? I just was wondering if you could give a little info there.
Mike Cordano: Yes, let me be very clear, we have ceased development on 10 and 15-K RPM hard drives. So, our products in the market are the last of our products, and we will obviously manage them through a long tail, but we don’t intend to introduce new products.
Rob Cihra: Can you tell us what that tail might be? Is this a tail of months or years?
Mike Cordano: No it’s a long tail of years.
Rob Cihra: Alright and then if I could ask the actual question. There has just been decent amount of debate frankly for several months now in terms of how much the tightness in demand has helped to drive market and get any obviously you sell both. Can you talk if you think there has been a meaningful equal help for drives or left cannibalization than there would have otherwise been because of tightness? Or do you really think it's had that much impact obviously looking back and then looking forward, if you think that’s about to change it all?
Mike Cordano: Yes, so there is only one real area that, that has had an effect and its really in mobile. So 2.5 inch drives and then we would say it had a modest positive effect on the size of the HDD markets and then looking at rearview mirror. So, our penetration rate if you will flash to HBD is running behind our original expectations. What we see happening this year is more normalizing of that trend.
Steve Milligan: In other words the penetration of SSD in notebook based configurations will accelerate, right, which we are agnostic to positive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman: I actually wanted to focus on your progress and strategy of your systems business, particularly now that you have had some time to integrate Tegile in your operations in addition to your JV with Unis over a year ago now that strengthens your opportunity to go after Asia hyperscale players, who actually have a large contribution to the increasing global hyperscale CapEx. So could you elaborate on what you have done so far to integrate those businesses? And whether or not you actually have all the pieces in your portfolio, you like to target this area of the storage market? And I have a quick follow-up please.
Steve Milligan: Sure. Yes, so I think the recent acquisition of Tegile was a positive step forward across all markets, but particular to your question on China because the adoption of object storage in China is lagging slightly so the ability to have a file front end and be able to lead with the product is more mature in the market then pages to our participation in the China market. So I think from an overall portfolio standpoint, we are encouraged by the addition of the product that came to the Tegile acquisition. We continue to make steady progress although we don’t talk specifically about the growth rate and size of that. It is growing sequentially and we’re making good progress and I think we’re happy with the results, particularly in the last couple of quarters as we’ve added the addition of these file all flash or ray products to our portfolio.
Karl Ackerman: As a follow-up, I would appreciate if you could elaborate on how much your cost saving assumption in your NAND business adhere includes the qualification of your internal NAND supply in your own enterprise SSD business?
Mark Long: That’s an easy question, I'll take it. The answer is none. So when we did SanDisk acquisition, we talked about is vertical integration opportunity and we actually decided especially when the markets went into a constrained position that extending out our relationship with Intel who gave us access to more bits and that has worked well for us and we’ve got some product introductions are going well with Intel. So from a business standpoint, not having our own NAND in all of our enterprise SSD we having some but not all that actually yielding a better long-term economic outcome than that we replaced all the Intel products immediately.
Mike Cordano: Right and I'll just add to that certainly that it’s a testament to the way that relationship is going, the quality of those products in the marketplace and what we think we can do it from also allowing us to focus our product R&D on other thing. So, there is a number of benefits in this choice that's advantaging us through calendar 2018.
Mark Long: Right, and the good news is as I indicated, we do still have the 20-20 target for the SanDisk transaction that will include significant benefits from vertical integration, so intersecting with our own product line that has our own name by that time period.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh: Just looking at the hard disk drive side, I saw you guys mention in starting the ramp of 12 and 14 terabyte drives. As you get small now just wondering what the mix would be as we exit 2018 with 12 and 14 terabyte?
Mike Cordano: Yes, we would expect as we exit calendar 2018 on the high cap range, it will be majority of our mix, but I did mention 12 and 14 together. And -- but I did mention what we do expect is this more diverse market as we pursue continued growth. So we will see a continued and steady mix up at the highest end of our portfolio but given different used cases and workloads, both technologically but also geographically we do think we’ll see a longer tail of shipments at the lower capacities, as we referenced in this announcement of these mid range product that we announced for a week or so ago.
Vijay Rakesh: On the demand side, I saw BiCS3, I assume that 64-layer was almost 70% plus shipments now. So, as we go through 2018, what are the puts and takes on the NAND gross margin? Where can you drive cost down, I guess 96-layer is more later in the year, but just wondering as you go through the year where the puts and takes in the gross NAND margins?
Mike Cordano: Well, so two things. One is continued yield and productivity on the existing ramps that is on throughput which is ongoing on that’s a big statement and then of course as we move to the new node in the second half of the year that gives us additional opportunity.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Steve Milligan: All right, so I want to thank everybody for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, our acquisitions, integration activities, and achievement of synergy goals; demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, deleveraging plans, our joint ventures with Toshiba and the outcome of related legal proceedings, investments in Fab 6, and supply of NAND flash memory. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2017. Any applicable forward-looking commentary is exclusive of one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions that may be announced after October 26, 2017. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their question. I thank you in advance for your cooperation. And now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions. We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver, as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace. I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So, as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk. From the beginning, our number one priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy into finding a resolution, one that respects our partnership, and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship. Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders, such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ-KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management. It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders. While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with the consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today. There are two potential paths for resolution. The stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future, or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum, following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the three-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion. SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018 in advance of Toshiba's announced timeframe to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious. And it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship. With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that, over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment. This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions, associated with the first tranche, are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good-faith commercially reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed. Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either. As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly-owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly-owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6. In closing, I want to emphasize the following; first, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process. Second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief. Third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently, as we did with the recently filed FAQ, and through public forums like this call. And finally, I want to reiterate that our number one priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day one, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders. I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion. With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results were better than expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technologies. In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products, such as iNAND, gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications. Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs' product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets. Our Client Solutions revenue grew strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched two new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand Base and My Cloud Home, as well as the world's highest-capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with a broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace. In Data Center Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter, as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives. In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth with reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities such as our 12-terabyte offering to handle the growth of varied workloads, and as the component shortages ease. In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation helium offering. Customer qualification activities in our fourth-generation helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive, remained on track and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter. We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012. Just over two weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling. Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market in years ahead. In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center applications. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our active scale products addressing big data, the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers. In our flash joint ventures, during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the uses of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer base products in calendar 2017. From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018. Furthermore, as we previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range. In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position with our capacity enterprise helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets, as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation. It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion; Client Devices was $2.7 billion; and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply/demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup. Turning to operating expense, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently-acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making investments in our future capabilities. Or non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Or non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges. In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously-declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and will continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure, while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility. We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter. Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the details related to Toshiba. My only question here is really around the guidance here for 2018. Can you give us a sense here in terms of how you expect the mix of SSD versus HDD to play out? Will there be any sort of outsized change there? And do you actually get a benefit as NAND pricing does come down? Do you actually see the potential for pent-up demand for more NAND-based or SSD-based products for WD? Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: So, Mark, let me give you some color on that. So, I think as we see ourselves progressing through this fiscal year, we feel fully comfortable with placement of our bit output in the various market segments. So, the demand is there sufficient to consume our bit output. Relative to the mix and penetration of SSD, I think that is somewhat slowed based upon NAND constraints at an industry basis. We would expect though the long-term penetration to kind of continue as planned, nothing sort of untoward.
Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess the first question maybe to start with, on the Toshiba dynamic, if they do go forward with the transaction that they've proposed, I'm curious, and you don't need to give me the exact details, but do you think you have a viable plan B, C and D to secure bit capacity beyond the calendar 2019 you've talked about? And broadly, the cross-licensing agreement you guys both have mentioned, the SanDisk IP, does that apply for Toshiba, even if they decide to ramp up production unilaterally without Western Digital? Or does that cross-licensing only get held up while it's done together?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Amit, this is Steve. I'll take the second question first. I would prefer not to comment on that in terms of how the technology licensing arrangements work. And then the second thing is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the joint venture agreements require bit output to be provided to us over a period of time, out to 2029.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. I guess if I could just maybe follow up on one thing, Intel, on their call, is just talking about signing a long-term NAND agreement and getting $2 billion of prepayment for that in 2017 and 2018. I'm curious, given the fact that NAND demand keeps outpacing the supply based on even what you guys are talking about, is there a potential for you guys to enter into strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers? And are you perhaps already doing that?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. I think those sort of long-term arrangements are can be part of our ongoing practice. So, yes, we do those sorts of things, and from time-to-time, prepayments would be one of the elements of those agreements.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is the open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. In terms of NAND availability, how are you dealing with allocation? Right now, we are going through ramp-up by some of the smartphone OEM customers that you have. And, in that context, given the tightness, how should we think about allocation mix between enterprise SSD and embedded application? Do any of these customers have a long-term agreement, which would require you to fulfill? Or should we think about economics of each driving the allocation? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. So, our allocation philosophy has two dimensions. Obviously, one of them you referenced, which is economic. The other is strategic. So we're looking at our goals of, sort of, optimizing between our current and mid-term financial results and our long-term objectives of growing and diversifying our customer base across multiple product segments. So, it's a complex formula, and it really is based on those two things. Obviously, based upon our results, we are growing in basically all of those segments and you can see the results of some of that activity.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. And I think just to add to that, the diversity from a market, product, and customer perspective that we have, oh, by the way, is by design. And the other thing is that, it allows us – it provides more resilience from a financial perspective to our model. So I think that diversification concept is something that is very central to the way that we run and manage the business.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. And then looking longer term, especially with the nearline and higher density products, when should we expect MAMR samples to be out there? And I'm assuming that both HAMR and MAMR products are going to be out there. And for us from outside, we're trying to figure out when is the earliest that we could look into the market and figure out the differences and the cost benefit for each technology?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: So, we said in our announcement that we would have samples out late in 2018 and production in 2019, which I just commented on. Relative to sort of our reasons for picking it, I stated in my comments obviously our view is the economic or commercial competitiveness of the technology made it a pretty obvious choice for us. Obviously, we needed to get some technology breakthroughs to get confident around our ability to achieve the areal density results required, but once that was done, it was a clear choice for us. One of the things I will point you to is really our internal manufacturing processes, and the ability for us to leverage the current perpendicular or PMR based manufacturing technologies and tooling we have in place.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: So, by late 2018, we should see field data that would help us compare the difference between the two?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: No, we will ship customer samples in 2018, we will ramp production in 2019.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Mike, you talked about the high-cap capacity growth reaccelerating or picking back up in 2018, after being muted in part by DRAM in 2017. I mean, is that just a sort of a DRAM availability thing? Or is there also an indication in terms of you talking to customers, cloud builders, service providers? I mean are you seeing their demand looking better irrespective of component availability? Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Let me back up a little bit. I think the demand has been there all along, right? So, what's happening in 2017 is not a reflection of the true demand environment, it's certainly been muted by external or temporary factors. And yes, our view of 2018 is based upon close planning work with our customer base both in hyperscale and outside of that.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And do you find from your OEM customers – I mean are they more traditional OEMs? Are they taking enough high cap to offset declines in mission critical? Or is it really just now at this stage, it depends on what the cloud service guys do? Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Well, yeah, so for us certainly the big consumers of capacity enterprise are the cloud providers, or hyperscalers. But the traditional storage OEMs still buy at a substantial rate relative to its impact on performance enterprise hard drives, it's really not capacity enterprise eroding that, it's SSD's and the new architectures and better cost performance you can get, displacing a new system design and new architectures that performance tier with flash based products.
Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Thank you. Just curious, as you roll up your forecast for fiscal 2018 – I'm sorry, looking into calendar 2018 I should say, I'm just curious what assumptions – I know you talked about long-term supply growth in that 35% to 45% range. What assumption are you making in terms of your own capacity, ability to supply capacity growth? And in that context, what are you assuming as far as your cost, the price erosion and your ability to take cost down as you ramp 3D 64-layer and beyond?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Mike can take the first part, and then Mark can take the second part.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Aaron, we talk about our expectation for bit growth rate, which is 35% to 45%. We would expect we will be growing in that same range, and we expect to be able to maintain the expected cost reductions that we've talked about, which are in that longer-range models 15% to 25%, as we continue to convert from 2D to 3D, it's sort of at the 15% to 20% at an industry level.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And kind of in that same context, as you look at the overall industry supply/demand dynamics, I know you talked about more or less a reiteration of favorable trends through the first half of the year, have you seen any indications at all, either positive or negative, as far as that potential even extending further or shortening?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, I think at this point it's really too early to tell. Certainly, we don't have any indication strongly to one side or the other, at this point.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. Steve, it sounds like you're pretty confident in supply here in 2018, 2019 and beyond, but can you give us some sense of confidence that these JVs will keep up with future NAND development, so future output as the technology sort of progresses? And will you still have the supply, if arbitration proceedings potentially go against you? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, it's in both of our best interest that we continue to advance the capabilities of the joint ventures from a technology and from a manufacturing perspective. And so, we're confident that ourselves and our joint venture partner will continue to invest appropriately in that capability going forward. And that's independent, frankly speaking, of how the arbitration proceedings turn out.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks, Steve. And can you comment on expectation sort of NAND pricing? How much was that up relative to your expectations of flat in September quarter? And what is sort of embedded in expectations in your December quarter guide? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I think we talked about last quarter that ASPs had flattened. That was our expectation coming into this quarter, and that's really our expectation as we sit today. So we don't see continued movement in a substantial way up, but it's being sustained at the current level.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Hey. Thanks. Great quarter, and thanks for the discussion on the JV. Just one for Mark, on gross margin over the midterm, so obviously you expect supply demand fundamentals in NAND to stay favorable through the first half. Can you just address and even qualitatively, how you expect the GM line to trend after that point? And I ask mostly because the Street is still north of 40%, which is obviously solidly above the high end of your range. So any forward-looking GM commentary would be helpful.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. And I think, certainly, as we look more near term, we are getting some benefit from the ramp of our BiCS3 technology, so that will give us some gross margin benefit, and that will continue into the first part of calendar 2018, which is a positive margin benefit. As we look out through and into 2018, that is our seasonally slower period in the first half for HDD, so we're going to have some offsetting declines in gross margin there. And I think net-net, we would expect still healthy gross margin through the rest of the fiscal year, but we wouldn't expect it to continue at the exact same level due to those seasonal factors and the mix with HDD.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to circle back on the NAND technology roadmap questions that were addressed earlier today. I understand that the Bain-led consortium must fulfill your supply agreements in place through 2029, but do the master agreements stipulate that Toshiba and the Bain-led consortium must invest in 3D NAND technology for your existing fabs? Because if not, it would appear that your lack of a supply agreement with Fab 6 today, where I think the current plan is to build 96 layer 3D NAND, limits your technology roadmap beyond the 3D NAND tools that are installed in Fab 3, Fab 4 and Fab 5 today? Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: As I indicated, we provided a lot of details in terms of my prepared remarks in addition to the 8-K. And as I noted, that our number one priority is the continued longevity and success of the joint venture, and some of the details that you're asking, I'd prefer not to get lost in the weeds in terms of some of those questions at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. When do you see data center solutions returning to growth? Could that happened as early as the calendar first quarter? And then, maybe, Mark, can you comment on where you see OpEx levels exiting the fiscal year?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. I will take the OpEx question, and then Mike can talk about the Data Center Devices and Solutions. In terms of OpEx, one of the things we should keep in mind is that we tend to have, or we annually have, a small spike in calendar Q1 that has to do with the reset of payroll taxes. So we would otherwise expect OpEx to be relatively consistent through the rest of the fiscal year, other than this slight increase in calendar Q1. And I think the key point is we will be exiting the year roughly in a position that's consistent with our long-term model, plus or minus, and I think we're currently operating within our long-term model much earlier than we had anticipated. The long-term model being 14% to 16% of revenue. And so I think our continued efficiencies that we're gaining from our achieving the synergy targets and from other transformational projects that we have ongoing should allow us to continue operating in a healthy range consistent with our long-term model.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Relative to the Data Center Devices and Systems – or Solutions growth, I think two things, two factors, I talked about Exabyte (44:58) growth rate relative to capacity enterprise expected to reaccelerate as well as our continued and planned progress around enterprise SSD product offerings puts us in a good position, as we progress through 2018 calendar year to have growth as we go.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just on the hard disk drive side, I was wondering if you could give us some color on 10-terabyte, how it grew sequentially and how do you see the December quarter and looking out.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, the color we'll give you is we did see significant quarter-to-quarter growth on 10 terabytes. We also saw the initial ramp on 12 terabytes, and we would expect that will accelerate into the current quarter. So, the continued movements of the market to the highest capacities in this case 10 terabytes and 12 terabytes is progressing very well. And we're very pleased with how that's moving in our business.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. And on the NAND side, when you look at the 64-layer NAND, where do you expect the mix of 64-layer by bit exiting this year? And let's say middle of next year, how do you see that? And with the Toshiba spat going on, do you see any disruption in that 64-layer ramp? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I don't think we provided any numbers for calendar 2018 at this point. But we are getting more fixed re-output (46:38) than the 2D NAND at this point, so we've realized that crossover point. And we've seen no impact of the situation with Toshiba that's changed that. No disruption to what our expectations and plans were previously, and we do not expect that into calendar 2018 either.
Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.: We'll wrap up with this next questioner. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.
Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. I just wanted to continue the discussion about the outlook. As we think about the beginning of next year, clearly the PC market has held up a little bit better this year. What's your thinking about the first half of the year? You mentioned some seasonality in your business, is that the area where we should see the most seasonality? And implicitly with gross margins staying in that low 40% range, the seasonality in the first half, presumably when volumes return into maybe the second half of 2018, does that imply that we get some strength back in margins as well? Thanks very much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, I think your perspective – one of the drivers for seasonality is PC, so, yes, you're on it. Also the consumer segments of our business also see a seasonal trends, that would include gaming, as an example. And yes, obviously, when we move into the second half of the calendar year, we do see some absorption benefits that help us on the margin.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. From an HDD standpoint, we'll see that. And then for the remainder of the calendar year, the flash margins will depend on the supply/demand environment.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: All right. So you've got a follow-up question quickly, please? I think we're done. Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: All right. I want to thank, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions. We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance, as we addressed a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition. On a pro forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top-line growth, and we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role and the data storage ecosystem. For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets. Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfill the market's growing storage requirements. Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on. I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialog with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties. Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures. In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry. I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. With several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business, all of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment, and HDD results were largely within our expectations. We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives, and our operational advancements remained on track. Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our client devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker than expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base, and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD. Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity. In client solutions, the strength of our WD, HGST and SanDisk brands, combined with our global distribution capabilities, allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been our relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy. Turning to data center devices and solutions. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10 terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform four years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12 terabyte helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10 terabyte platform and our expectation to continue our generational lead with the 12 terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years. For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Given certain industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings. In our JV fab operations, we continued the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently -announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018. In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND. From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's Fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018. From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018. In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities, and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across a broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation. Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter, and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro forma basis. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full-year fiscal 2017. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup. Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges-related integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges. In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow, with $178 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaled $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll start off with – and I realize you guys don't break out your HDD financials in detail, but could you perhaps provide some color to help us differentiate your performance in sort of the classic Western Digital performance versus what your competitors saw in the June quarter and especially how that trends as you go forward in the nearline market, please?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. So let me start with a bigger picture. I think for some time, we've been adjusting both our product roadmap and our product investment to try to get that optimized versus how we see the market evolving over time. That is one dimension. The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis and our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy. But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10 terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year and that's from 10 terabyte to 12 terabyte. So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions. And just to give you a bit of a reference point (23:53) our legacy hard drive only model, we're operating somewhere near the higher end of that model, to give you a little more flavor.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. That's extremely helpful. And I guess let me just follow up, on a broader basis when you look at the portfolio you have today with NAND and HDD and both sides seem to be doing well, is there an opportunity or are you seeing traction and able to get some revenue synergies in terms of perhaps into a enterprise customer who needs NAND, which is in tight supply, and trying to get higher allocations and drives, as well, or vice versa where you can have better NAND business and you can get more HDD market share. Is that an opportunity, is that something that you're going after right now?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. I think the way you should think about that is, customers see us in a very strategic fashion. It comes down to the breadth of our portfolio and their view of us as a long-term relevant partner. And so that translates to a more strategic engagement, which ultimately turns into a better commercial engagement over time.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thanks, Amit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question come from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the revenue mix, if you could give us an update on how you're tracking with the data center solution. Last December, you talked about the TAM of $23 billion by 2020, and I want to see where you are and what are the key milestones in the next 6 to 12 months, and I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: It's PCS, yeah.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think the market size opportunity, we would see, is relatively the same and unchanged. We certainly see unstructured data and object storage, as the most optimum way to pursue that is a strategically viable path. We remain committed and convicted to that. As we've also said we're in a nascent phase of our business. I think we're making good progress. You saw that we brought Phil Bullinger into the company to continue to evolve our capabilities in this area. I would say we're satisfied with progress, but it's a little too early to talk about the specifics.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then as a follow-up, just as we're trying to better assess the risk or think of the scenarios, what happens if you're not able to secure NAND wafer from the JV? What are the contingency plans?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, right now, one of the things that I would emphasize, Mehdi, is that we continue to secure wafer output. We expect to continue to secure wafer output, and from a manufacturing and operations perspective, the JV remains very healthy.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: And what about the what-if scenario?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I don't think that that's a reasonable scenario to be considered. I would find that to be – and I'm not sure how to characterize it, but just highly unrealistic assumption to assume that.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions, and I have two as well. Appreciating that you guys don't split out the HDD versus the flash business, I still believe a lot of investors will look at – kind of thinking about the dynamics between the two, in particular around gross margin. And so my question is as we kind of progress – and last quarter, you talked about hitting a crossover on a cost perspective with 64 layer, how are we to think about that dynamic relative to what might be left and continued upside drivers to your flash business from a margin perspective?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So let me just talk about that. Our guidance does not assume any continued upward movement in bit cost. So what we've assumed is that we're in a fairly stable period on a go-forward basis. So obviously, as we – to the extent that remains ongoing, we would expect our margins in our flash business to stay at the current level.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Absent changes in mix and that sort of thing, or customers.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then back to kind of the synergies, I mean when you look at it, you've got still quite a decent amount of synergies to flow through the model. How are we thinking about, let's call it, that remaining $300 million of annualized synergies to be realized exiting calendar 2017 relative to the reinvestment of those synergies into the model?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, two things. First, the synergies that we're providing are – those are net synergies, with respect to what we're doing specifically for the SanDisk integration. And as you know, those synergies are both at the expense level as well as at the revenue level. So we see continued opportunity to achieve that $500 million a year run rate by the end of – it's really also the same time period, right? Eighteen months after the deal is about the end of this calendar year. So we feel very good about that. And as we've said, one of the areas that we've had very good success from a revenue synergy standpoint is in the ability to drive greater revenue in the client SSD space, as an example, by leveraging our strength in the client HDD market. So that's been very successful.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. We've heard a lot from a couple of companies about lower demand levels in enterprise based on higher NAND costs and higher DRAM costs. Clearly, your business benefited from the trends to higher costs, but are you seeing lower demand? You mentioned performance was weaker, and I know you guys have been deemphasizing that. But are you seeing lower demand from customers because prices are elevated? Or are you not seeing that?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think particularly as we think about the nearline or capacity enterprise market, as I stated, we've revised down our outlook for exabyte growth this year. The reason for that is really twofold. It is component supply shortages and then correspondingly in some instances the cost of components. So those two things are demand headwinds for us in the hyperscale market or for the industry. As I also stated, we think we will grow at the predicted 40% rate, and that's really based on our product portfolio and the advantage we have there. To some extent, we also would say it's a similar trend in PCs. We saw PCs being a little softer, maybe down 2%. We think the same thing is in effect there. Both cost and availability is really creating some headwinds for PC makers.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to follow up on the gross margin line, you guys now have been above the gross margin targets for two quarters and guiding higher for next quarter. You've got significant cost savings to come. I guess the question is, is your long-term target the right target because it seems like it should be higher or do you have the view that as things sort of level off in the NAND market that we'll go back to the prior targets in the high 30s for the gross margins? Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, you're certainly right that we've been operating above our long-term model. And I think at this point, we do feel it's a prudent model, and it does allow us to make the right investments to scale appropriately, but as we get more data and as we continue to ramp our 3D NAND technologies, we will always review the model. But at this point, we do believe that's the right range. But it's not a ceiling, and we certainly do everything we can to ensure that we're operating at the right gross margin level, so that we're ensuring that the financial model is appropriately optimized for the environment, and that's what you're seeing right now.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So, I think Sherri, just to add a little bit of color, this is Steve. I mean we're obviously pleased and will continue to do everything that we can to operate outside our gross margin model from an upside perspective. That being said, this is a factual comment and not meant to alarm anybody, the reality is that subsequent to when we acquired SanDisk, we have been dealing with very favorable market conditions as it relates to NAND. We all know that supply and demand will even out a bit more and it'll become less of a constrained environment. Or historically, when that happens, is that puts a little bit more downward pressure on your margins. As we go through, call it, that sort of a cycle, we'll have a better idea of what happens in that kind of an environment. We'll use that information and then see if a revision of the margin ranges that we've indicated previously is appropriate. And believe me, as the CEO of the company, we'd be happy to raise those margin levels if we think that makes sense as we move through a bit more time.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you, and good afternoon. Continuing that thread, I just had a question, Steve or Mark. Have you guys entered into any strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers to ensure they have adequate supply of NAND? And as a result, do they have to give you volume commitments as part of those agreements? And then the follow-up question is how should we think about 2018? I think a lot of investors are quite appreciative of how you're executing and what the model has been generating. But can you still have a 40% or so gross margin from the balance of calendar 2018? Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Hey, Mark. This is Mike. Let me talk about the customer engagement. So I think for a number of reasons, customers have chosen to engage on a longer horizon. Some of it is technology access, some of it is supply assurance. And certainly, we are operating on a multi-quarter or, in some instances, well into 2018 basis with customers. And that's some of the reason we feel comfortable making the statement that we've made, that we believe the flash market will stay constrained through the first half of 2018. It's really the way the market and customers are prepared to engage us.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Right. And as it relates to financial forecast for 2018, we just haven't provided that level of granularity although, as Mike points out, we expect to have the first half of calendar 2018 benefit from the strong NAND environment, and we would expect gross margin to benefit accordingly.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is Atica (36:46) calling in for C.J. Can you talk a little bit more about your expected synergies from HGST and SanDisk and what still remains to be done there?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. Well, what still remains to be done is to close the gap between what we stated as the Q4 results, so roughly the $700 million in HGST synergies on an annual run rate basis, that by the end of the year, we have a $800 million target, so we expect to close that. And as we always do, our plans are to exceed the goals. But at this point, it's the $100 million of incremental synergies that we need to close the gap to the goal.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Which we have plans to execute on that, by the way.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: We have plans. We're highly confident. And if you think about the COG side of the equation, we have largely reached our internal goal to hit the $800 million, and we are working to close the OpEx side of it, just to provide a little more visibility. On the Schrader side...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: You mean SanDisk.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: On the SanDisk side – sorry. That's our codename.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: You used the codename, just so you know.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: On the SanDisk side, of the $300 million left to achieve the $500 million target, we're also very confident, we feel we have the plans in place and the momentum both on the revenue synergies that I talked about earlier and on the cost and more the OpEx synergies. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve the $500 million in SanDisk synergies as well.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. And then for my follow-up, can you talk a little bit about your view on further reducing your debt?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, as we stated, we remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plan, and in addition to that, we will continue to review value creation opportunities as they arise. So long term, getting to the investment grade status is still our objective, and we will continue to look for the best way to deploy capital from a strategic standpoint in addition to our deleveraging.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong results. Just one for me, just circling back again to the revenue synergy conversation, Steve and Mike – I think I've asked about it sort of a few quarters ago – revenue synergy potential. It seems like it's coming up as a point of topic already just a few quarters in. And so I guess my question is, without – kind of knowing you're not going to give a guide around it and then maybe you aren't even able to yet, why wouldn't – I guess asking this way, why wouldn't the revenue synergy opportunity, as you guys have described it today, not ultimately be significantly bigger than the cost synergy side of things, the $500 million? Just in general it would seem – not when we see this kind of combination, I just think over the years it seems like a very classic, even less strategic than this revenue synergy for companies could be at least 5% or 10% kind of revenue synergy. And the $500 million on the cost side is I think 2% of the combined company revenue. So I guess, long-winded, why wouldn't there be an opportunity longer term to amplify this to a much more significant degree, like the billions of dollars?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So first of all, the $500 million mark reference is a combination of the two, and it's really timing relative to our original projections. So we would not disagree. We see revenue synergy as a very strong strategic opportunity. We're well on our pace to execute those synergies, and we see more in front of us. So I would not disagree in general with your statements. But the $500 million is a combination of the two, as well as the further out targets that we gave at the time of the acquisition.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Right. And just to clarify, so the end of this calendar year is where we have the $500 million annual run rate synergies for the SanDisk acquisition. And then in 2020 we have $1.1 billion of total synergies. So you're right, we continue to drive all the different synergies, the cost synergies, the OpEx synergies, as well as the revenue synergies...
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Right.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: ...for the long term.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Appreciate the clarification. And just a quick follow-up, same topic. Where are you guys just in the process of engaging clients, holistically, enterprise clients and CSPs holistically with the portfolio? Where are you mechanically with that process, as in when do you think you'll sort of have that process complete?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: So it depends on the particular CSP. Some of them were more advanced than others, and it really depends on their product requirements. As we've stated, our enterprise SSD portfolio, although we have some competitive products, is not all that we would expect it to be. That portfolio gets stronger in 2018, which will further enable that process. So that remains sort of a forward-looking positive lever for us as we engage, but we are well underway mechanically with all of them. It's really in some instances where we don't have all the product fits that we need.
Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Really helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions on the NAND side. How is the 64 layer progressing and what do you expect bit growth on the SanDisk side? And do you see any scenario where you could be blocked, or your supply of NAND could be blocked under any scenarios?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I'll talk about that. We're making very good strong progress on 64-layer BiCS3 technology, and our yields are very strong, so it's consistent with Mike's prepared remarks. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making on BiCS3 as well as frankly the progress that we're making on our next generation, the 96-layer BiCS4. So very pleased and hats off to the team in terms of the progress that's being made. In terms of bit growth, we have indicated that the industry growth will be towards the lower end of our longer-term expectation of 35% to 45% and that's for calendar 2017. And we would anticipate that our specific bit growth will be a little bit higher than that. So we'll be slightly exceeding on the industry growth rate. And then, your comment or question with regards to, I guess, being cut off from a NAND supply perspective. It's similar to the question that we had earlier and that is a very unlikely scenario.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. On the hard disk side, 10 terabyte, you guys have done very well, especially last quarter. Do you think there is a sustainable moat there where you can sustain that market share on your 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte going forward? Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, we do. So I think it begins with the helium platform maturity. It's a complex technology to get right, to deliver reliable product in the field, to ramp at high-volume, and that's just the base. We also have a pipeline of other technologies that we think are well-situated to allow us to continue to maintain and protect that lead. So we feel very good about the 10 terabyte, we feel good about the 12 terabyte, and frankly speaking, we feel good about products after that.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller of The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Following up on the last question where you believe you'll sustain your leadership in the 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte helium drives, your competitor has kind of led in the shingled media. Do you see yourself pulling closer to them over the next year?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think relative to SMR technology, it's about, from our standpoint, when we deploy that and to what market. I would acknowledge that our competitor went earlier in client and they had a lead on us. We're in the process of closing that. But our strategy has been from the beginning, deploy the technology where most value could be obtained from it and we see that happening frankly speaking at 14 terabytes and beyond and we'll be quite competitive at that point.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: And you said the flash demand supply won't come back into balance until the middle of next year. Do you have any ways – or do you believe there was any double ordering in the marketplaces?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: So there is always some of that in the world, but obviously, I referenced our engagement with customers and our ability to construct agreements with them that gives us confidence about our position into the first half of 2018. And normally customers, if they believe the supply circumstances would be different, they would not entertain such agreements. So it's an affirming point of view to our general market expectation.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to start off, you made the comments about Fab 6 and availability of output next year. We thought that in some of the filings you guys had made you'd said that negotiations over Fab 6 and Fab 7 had stopped. So I wonder, have things progressed on that front? I mean is that – have there been developments since the filings on the positive on that? Could you just kind of update us on that? And then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Sure, Rod. And as – well, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we remain in constructive dialog with Toshiba and our stakeholders in Japan and that includes conversations with regards to Fab 6.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And just, I guess I'll follow up on the same question. And the thing is, Steve, you guys filed in core documents that negotiations had stopped and now you have a high level of confidence that output's coming in 2018. So it sounds like you're pretty confident on the situation there. So I just wonder, has there been positive development in terms of the discussion or is there no development, no change from the core documents I guess is the question?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, Rod. In all honesty, I am not familiar with the details of all the particular filings that you're referring to, so I can't comment on that specific filing. Recognize that the discussions and various things that have been going on with Toshiba, there's been a lot of back and forth, and it's been a difficult situation for all of us including for Toshiba. And rather than talking about the history in terms of the back and forth that's occurred, I can assure you and our shareholders that last week and ongoing we're having discussions with Toshiba regarding Fab 6 and the discussions are constructive.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's great. I appreciate that, Steve. And then I just – could you comment a little bit about the hard drive market expectations you have as we look into September? Do you guys expect the TAM to grow into September? Could you give us any idea, kind of color on what you think the overall market is going to look like?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So just a little more color to my earlier comments around both hyperscale and PC. We would expect there will be some seasonal – normal seasonal growth in the back half, but both of those will be muted somewhat by those factors I talked about. We had previously been looking at about a flat PC market for the year. We now are projecting or planning for down about 2%, and then we also gave color or revision down on industry exabytes deployed in capacity enterprise, which we think will be around 30% which is down from the originally planned for 40%.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Sure.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So we want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now we'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.: Good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance and our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, our product portfolio, product features, development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, and our joint venture partnership and business ventures with Toshiba. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the investor relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their question. Thank you in advance for that, and I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39. With three consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products, enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. And I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations. The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions. Strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry, our team continues to execute very well on two key strategic priorities. The integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on. I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba, driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. Our goals throughout this, the current process, have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry, and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over its 17-year duration. Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders. We are committed to continuing this storied partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders. And we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation. I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong. And the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to the favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and this helped mitigate typical seasonality. We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology, and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well. In client devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications, while traditional commute demand was softer as expected. Demand for our solid-state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attach rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs, enabling us to expand our market presence. We commenced shipments of our 64-layer, 3D NAND in client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017. In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our three-bit per-cell x3 offerings. Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things. Turning to client solutions, our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. The strong appeal of our WD, SanDisk and G-Technology brand continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis. In data center devices and solutions, we saw sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter. Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth-generation helium product, underscoring our generational lead in this category. I'm pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch four years ago. From a memory, technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. These achievements are particularly noteworthy, indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies. Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018 somewhat higher than in 2017. When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry's supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation. Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.3 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our March quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We saw sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD. Client solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue. Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation, driven by our better-than-expected financial results. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated term loan B and our U.S.-dollar term loan B. The aggregate annual savings from these two repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings starting in our June quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges. In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost-of-revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017 we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65 with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares. As we described in detail during our last investor day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12.00 for the full calendar year 2017. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to focus in on the NAND business a little bit and just see if you could talk to us about the ASP trajectory in the quarter, and how we should be thinking about ASPs as we look forward and we compare back to the spot market, relative to what you guys are recognizing. Any comment on your thoughts on bit growth would also be interesting, given Samsung continues to save 30% so you guys are a little higher than them. Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: This is Mike. Let me give you comments on both. First on ASP, as you know, most of our bits are sold in products, not in the open market or at the component level, so we have realized pricing gains but – and we expect that favorable trend to continue through the back half of the year. But I would not peg us directly to the spot market price because of the way we go to market. Secondly, I think I noted the low end of the range, obviously the low end of the range being around 35%. I think we're – we remain comfortable that the industry will be in that neighborhood.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you. We learned this today that former CEO of SanDisk and Chairman, just joined Micron. And, Mike, I want to better understand whether the things that you have put in place to safeguard from any potential recruiting of key assets, especially on the SanDisk side. And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, well, part of – this is Steve, Mehdi. Part of our job is, no matter who shows up at what places, that our most important asset is our people. And part of the things that we try to do on a routine basis, is make sure that not only do they remain with our company, but that they're motivated and giving 110%, if you want to call it that, to the performance of the company, and we're going to continue to do that going forward, frankly, no matter who shows up at which one of the companies that may have an interest in recruiting our people.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. And then as follow up, going back to your helium-based product, how should we think about the mix between 10- and 12-terabyte, and do you have any assessment of your market share as helium-based products are further penetrating the install base?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, let me comment. I think as the year progresses, we would see the increasing deployment as a percentage of the total of 10-terabyte, which we feel very comfortable with our current product capability as well as our design win outlook across the major consumers of that product. Later in the year we may see some 12-terabyte begin to happen at greater scale, so that transition has begun. We also see ourselves in a good position from a exabyte share perspective, and we would think those trends will continue in a positive manner throughout the year.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first off, just on the 40% gross margin guide that you guys have for June quarter, could you just talk about what's driving the upside versus your longer-term model? And is it reasonable to think that both the NAND and HDD segments at this point are probably tracking well ahead of your long-term targets for each of those segments?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think right now we're seeing a combination of stable HDD market and a strong flash market, so it's that combination that's resulting in the 40% gross margin.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: And strong execution, both from just an operational perspective and from a cost perspective, which obviously that part of it is something that we'll be doing in effect independent of the demand or pricing environment.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Exactly. And I do think on a go-forward basis over the long-term, we do have more opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our cost structure, both through our transformation that is ongoing as we said and through the deployment of our new technology as they ramp. So I think we feel very good about the gross margin performance and the long term, as we said, earnings power of this platform.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And if I could just follow-up, Steve, you talked about working with Toshiba to come up with a win-win solution with what's going on. Does that suggest that you're actually having more exclusive discussions with them at this point? And what do you think the time line to get a resolution on this process is from your perspective?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, the reality is we talk to Toshiba all the time. They're our partner, and so we have ongoing engagements with them or discussions with them at various different levels. The question with regards to timing, that I can't speculate on, and so I'm going to have to punt on the answer to speculating on that question.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Fair enough. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the great execution, guys.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the operating expense line. Mark, I think a quarter or two ago you had talked about getting to a normalized operating expense level in the $770 million range for this March quarter. I know that you're guiding flat in the current quarter, but I'm curious of how you would currently characterize your normalized operating expense level as we start to look into the realization of the full synergies. And I have a real quick follow-up as well.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. I think the most important thing to keep in mind from an OpEx standpoint is we have these two factors. One is we have the higher incentive base comp that flows through when we significantly exceed our expectations. So that's one part of it, but the second, and the more important part, is we are making ongoing investments that will enable future growth, as we see the opportunity to accelerate a number of our R&D projects. So we're doing that. As I also said, we're making continued investments in other areas of IT systems to make sure that we have the right platform for this sustainable growth.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then as a quick follow up, I'm curious. Based on maybe my math, it looks like you saw a healthy maybe uptick in the average capacity per hard disk drive, and I'm wondering if you could talk about what you've seen there? And how we should think about that trajectory going forward?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I think two dimensions. One is there's the normal seasonality, some of the lower capacity segments in the market were running at a lower rate in the period just closed. So you get the mix up effect that happens there. But the other one that's maybe more important and secular is, as we transition to 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte in capacity enterprise and as that segment takes on a disproportionately important role for us, that will continue to drive capacity per unit up. And as I commented earlier, we expect that to continue through the balance of this year and beyond.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham and Co. Your line is now open.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions. First Mark, on the inventory side, days inventory increased or – is that just linearity in the quarter? Were you careful with shipping towards the end on any pricing issues? And then I have a follow up.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. Rich, it was actually simpler than that. We had inventory build that was a function of a buffer for our ongoing transformation. And then we did have some inventory builds based on anticipated demand. So it was...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Primarily long lead time kind of stuff, right?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yes.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: With the fairly strong demand we're seeing in capacity enterprise.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: That's right.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then – thank you. And then secondly, when it comes to the industry, the NAND side, returning to a more normal environment, I mean, how should we think about that, Mike? Is that something that's going to happen all at once? Or you think it will be a gradual thing in 2018?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Sort of hard to be specific. I think what we – sort of the new news from us on this call that we've been talking about through the end of the calendar year, now our visibility would tell us, we think it's going to remain in a constrained environment sort of through the first half of 2018. How that evolves ultimately, hard to tell, Rich.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, thank you very much and the $12 number, thanks for providing that. That's very helpful and impressive.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. Steve, you said regarding Toshiba that WD should lead and help implement this transaction that would be good for all stakeholders. I was wondering what sort of ownership changes are you philosophically opposed to and why? Maybe without going into specifics of companies, but what sort of things are concerning to you regarding some of the options that were out there? Was it IP risk? Was it operational risk? What sort of things, if you could handicap that? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, I'm not going to get into the details of that on this call. One, a lot of this has been speculation in the press in terms of other bidders. And so I'd rather not get into the details of, one, our view on the situation, nor speculate on what's happening with some of these other supposed bidders.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. As my follow-up, sounds like your view on the tightness of the NAND environment, I think you guys just commented that's pushed out to first half of 2018. If you were to say, is this more a function of higher demand from newer applications or lower yields in NAND, causing supply shortages? How would you probably rank order those? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, I think – and this is Steve. I think it's a little bit of, kind of all of the above, so to speak. But one of the things that we need to understand is that this conversion – and it is a conversion as opposed to new capacity. This conversion to 3D NAND is difficult. It's difficult for all of us. We believe that we're executing in a very solid and sound fashion and demonstrated by the fact that we now achieve cost crossover with our 1Z platform. But this is tough stuff, and so it maybe is taking a little bit longer from a conversion standpoint and from a yield perspective than what people estimated. And so therefore, the bit growth rate is a little bit lower than all of us expected, and demand continues to be strong, driving a tight environment.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Congrats on the great execution.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: You're clearly operating toward the high end of your long-term gross margin model that you just laid out four months ago with what looks like legacy SanDisk operating with a five handle in front of it. NAND ASPs are clearly helping you and you're still in process of your 64-layer ramp, but I was hoping you could touch on the opportunities to further expand your margins within the hard drive business and specifically enterprise, as your overall margins were a record this quarter despite what looks like softer enterprise units this quarter. And I have a follow-up, please.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yes, I think there's two areas, and then Mark will have some details. So one is, is we continue to progress forward into the 10- and 12-terabyte in capacity enterprise. That's obviously helpful to our hard drive margins. The other thing is, which was also referenced, we are not through the transformation and restructuring and integration, which will help us optimize our cost basis. So both of those things are ongoing and continue through this year and into next year.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And just...
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yes.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Sorry. Go ahead.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Oh, no. I was just going to say a key part of the model is that given the diversified product portfolio, we have a number of operating levers that we can use to manage and optimize good environments and manage volatility in more challenging environments. So we feel very good about how that platform is evolving.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, you have begun to make meaningful progress on integrating Hitachi. But relative to your SanDisk integration efforts, there's still a lot of runway left and I was hoping you could just indicate where you are in the process of qualifying legacy SanDisk NAND into your own enterprise SSD business. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yes. So, I think, as we've discussed before, we are actually qualifying our own NAND into products as they are developing and they enter the market. We remain quite happy with our relationship with Intel, and if you think about it that way, it's actually incremental bits that we are providing to the market, so it's a net accretive or positive thing. So at this point, we are going to continue on through a generation or two, more products with our relationship with Intel, and we'll really up our participation of our own NAND in the enterprise through development and launch of new products within our portfolio.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: And that vertical integration that you're talking about really is – was not contemplated in that initial $500 million of total synergies for the 18-month window. The lion's share of that will be reflected in the 2020 target of $1.1 billion of synergies.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Co. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: There has been a leadership in the helium drives you've exercised for four years. Seagate has, I think, led in the shingled media area, but both firms are making progress in the areas that they were not originally leading in. I'm just wondering, do you see both firms coming to parity in each of those areas next year in terms of introduction of products and the quality of their products in shingled and in helium-filled drives?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: I'm not going to speculate on that, Mark. I mean, we don't know where Seagate is and what progress they're making. I can tell you that our focus is on executing on our plans. And so in that regard, we will not be striving for parity.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: What about the shingled media drives? Any estimates on what percentage of drives will be shingled media or are you going to just...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: We haven't really provided that information. I mean, shingle's been a little bit more limited in terms of the applications because of some of the performance implications of that and that sort of thing. But we feel comfortable with where we're at in terms of SMR transition and the applicability and the drives that we're providing to our customers.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Congratulations and keep up the impressive results. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yes. Hi. I had a question. So, just looking at the Toshiba side, obviously, you guys are having a lot of negotiations there. Is there – do you guys have a right of first refusal? I know you have concentrates, but is there a right of first refusal and is there a time line to that process?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: We have consent provisions, is what we have regarding any transferred assets and JV provisions, as I've mentioned earlier.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. But is there a time line to that process at all or...?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, similarly, the answer to the question, I'm not going to speculate on time lines.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. And the second question is that – on the NAND side, as you look at the 14 and 64 ramp, what's the mix in the back half and what's the – how do the gross margins look?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Well, we talked about our mix in the back half. It would be 75% of our 3D-bit output will be 64 layer exiting the calendar year.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: And that's for the – no, that's for the full calendar year, which means that by the time you get to the back half, the lion's share of our output in terms of 3-D is going to be 64 layer.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: We're already transitioning out of 48 into 64. 48 layer was more of a learning platform for us, if you want to call it that, as opposed to something that we intended to extensively productize and ship. It was really for our learnings.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter, guys.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you so much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the afternoon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, our product portfolio, product features, development efforts, and expansion into new data storage markets and our joint venture partnership with Toshiba. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 8, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-answer session part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their questions. I thank you in advance to your cooperation and I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Steve Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. At our Investor Day on December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy, and business model, and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With a growing storage industry and evolving data driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers validating our approach to value creation. We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that began earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drivers, all NAND based products, and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger than expected PC demand. We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day. We continue to execute well on two key strategic priorities, the integration of HGST, SanDisk, and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND. In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio spanning removable embedded client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings. As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance we will act to protect Western Digital's interest and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink on board as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation. I'm sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital. I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the December quarter.
Mike Cordano: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio, amidst the favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating. We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platform is increasingly aligned with our customer strategic direction. Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016 providing business momentum as we entered 2017. In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully increased as a driving portfolio of hard drives and flash based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products, as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefitted us further in a seasonally strong quarter. Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business. Switching to client solutions. We experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions. We announced new retail prospects including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for the MAC. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND based retail products began in the December quarter and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond. In the data center category, demand for high capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year Petabyte growth for capacity optimized hard drive met our upwardly revised expectation which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate Petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%. At our Investor Day, we announced that 12 Terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as derivative SMR based 14 Terabyte drive marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched four years ago, demonstrates two true cost of ownership value for our customers and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform. Notably the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million helium drives reflecting our leadership in this category. From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and a high capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio. In our data center solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage system. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continued to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. Turning to Silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already began retail product shipments containing 64-layer of BiCS3 and we also expect to launch client SSDs and embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year. Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer of BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology. In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab6 along with our joint venture partner Toshiba. Fab6 will provide new cleanroom space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab6 to commence in calendar 2018. In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform; deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio and technology expertise, along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider. I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.
Mark Long: Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalize on our strong product offerings, achieve targeted costs, and efficiency improvements, and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics. Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.4 billion and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period. Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud related storage demand. As a result, this quarter we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives, as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs. Client devices which include both hard drives and flash based products benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash based products during the holiday season. Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy target, while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter driven by the debt repricings and reduction. Our non-GAAP other expenses net of interest income were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter it will result in lower expenses in future periods. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges. In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations with $189 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annualized basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy and investments are on track for the significant ramp of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners. I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis. As I have previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38% primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business. Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect those to total approximately $800 million consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our cost and at the same time support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10 with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions]. We will be taking our first question for the day from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I guess one of the things that stands out is that the near line business or I should say the total enterprise business, your capacity shift was down about 8%, your units were down about 1%, I think Seagate was down 14% sequentially on capacity shift. But the data points that we have seen throughout the quarter seem to be fairly healthy even Niedek recording pretty healthy growth in the spindle motors and enterprise. So I'm curious is are you ceding share to Toshiba what the dynamics look like specifically in the enterprise market and whether or not you are kind of capacity constrained and that was a variable to consider?
Mike Cordano: First of all, I think the year-over-year growth; I talked about in my comments, Aaron. So we saw coming at kind of as expected in around 40%. The other thing I would say is some of this is timing of when this revenue shows up. So from our standpoint we are seeing consistent demand and continued and continued strength and demand there. So I don't think there is anything we would say was outside of our planning expectation. And let me just add to your comment on share, we don't believe we ceded any share in the period.
Aaron Rakers: And were you at all capacity constraint?
Steve Milligan: We are -- this is Steve, Aaron. We are tight on capacity as it relates to capacity enterprise. The amount that we ship was not meaningfully impacted in terms of capacity constraints. But when you talk about this last quarter by the way given there is a large component count, if we saw demand spike in any regard we would struggle to meet some of that demand. But right now we are comfortable with where we are at from an overall capacity perspective but it is we are running pretty hard in terms of our capacity enterprise both in one account as well as on hard drive capacity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is open.
Rich Kugele: Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations as well. Couple of questions I guess first when it comes to the cloud service or rather landscape, your percentage of the business if we include NAND going into that segment, I mean obviously the high capacity enterprises, a big factor there but are you supplying a large amount of the SSD side as well and then I have a follow-up?
Mike Cordano: Well certainly hyperscale is generally a growing segment for us, Rich, and as you know that today is principally SATA based interface, so yes we see that as a growing market opportunity and participation for us.
Rich Kugele: Okay. And then Mark if you needed to access quite a bit of capital for investment in let's say to Toshiba business further, how much capacity do you have on the balance sheet for leverage and or ask maybe another way, what's the minimum amount of cash you need to run the business?
Mark Long: Well Rich let me just say this first with respect to running the business, we have more than adequate liquidity and we feel very good about both our cash balances and the location of our cash. So that's something we are in very good shape on. With respect to strategic opportunities and accessing additional cash, I would just say we don't comment on anything in particular. And with respect to accessing additional liquidity, we recognize there are variety of ways we can do it, we feel like we have good alternatives with respect to additional capital, if we find an opportunity that weren't accessing more capital. But at this point, we just feel very good about our liquidity, feel very good about the way the business is operating, and one of the things we should also highlight is all this is within the context of our long-term commitment to deleveraging. So we really feel like we are in a good position from a balance sheet standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I have two follow-ups. The mission critical seem to be pretty strong in December quarter and I want to bit understand what is driving that obviously with NAND and SSD prices going up that may have shifted demand to more hard disk drive and also traditional enterprises have it yet in budget flash. So if you could elaborate on those two drivers and my follow-up question has to do with the free cash flow margin that came in around 18%, how should we think about sustainability of that free cash flow margin into 2017? Thank you.
Mike Cordano: Yes, let me comment first on performance enterprise. I think it's largely the seasonality the year-end purchase cycle that drove it. So we don't see any change in sort of our long-range plans relative to SSD as a substitute for performance enterprise. So we see that as more sort of a temporary effect. I will comment generally speaking on constraints around NAND whether it would be this category or the client category, the sort of tight supply situation is creating our modest bleeding effect for hard drive demand.
Mark Long: With respect to our cash flow generation kind of two things, one at Investor Day, we talked about a long-term range between 37 and 42 days for our cash conversion cycle and we did come in below that range due to strong linearity and some other very good execution by our team. So we would expect that in the near-term we may be at the lower end of the range or slightly below it, but there -- over the long-term as we talked about at Investor Day as flash becomes a larger part of our revenue, we may operate closer to the middle or towards the high-end of that range but that's really a long-term statement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sherri Scribner: Hi thank you gentlemen. Just looking at the gross margin this quarter at the high-end of your updated range and the guidance for the March quarter suggest you're going to be at the high-end of the range for your gross margin. So the question is how long are these sort of high gross margin rates sustainable, I know the NAND market is very tight, it seems like there is some decent demand for the higher capacity hard drives but how long should we expect you to stay in this high-end of your range and should we expect you to revert back to sort of the middle of the range at some point? Thanks.
Steve Milligan: Sherry, this is Steve. I would add a few comments. I mean as we talked about before and will reiterate on this call, we are dealing with a tight NAND situation. We expect that situation to persist from a supply perspective through the balance of 2017, calendar 2017. So that obviously has a positive impact on our gross margins. As well as Mike indicated, we are seeing good mix in terms of our products particularly in terms of capacity enterprise, that's helping us and I think it's also important to note that the margin model that we've talked about one is a long-term gross margin model. That doesn't mean to say that first off that we are not going to stop at 38%. I mean if we can improve our margins beyond that, we are going to do that. And there also maybe sometimes where we actually exceed that, but right now in terms of the current quarter that we now began, we expect to operate at the high-end for some of the factors that I just mentioned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi. Your line is open.
Stanley Kovler: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about Exabyte growth within the quarter and the outlook between the NAND and the HDD business for the following quarter. If we stake out capacity optimizer if you strip out that segment, what was the trend between the NAND and the HDD side of the business as far as capacity goes as we think about that coming down a little bit sequentially. And then as we look at the March quarter, what kind of seasonality do you expect from a unit perspective on the NAND and HDD businesses as well and I've a follow-up. Thank you.
Mark Long: So in terms of the first part and breaking down the Exabyte growth between hard drives and flash, we don't provide that that breakdown.
Steve Milligan: So we would also refer you to the investor material that we had at the Investor Day in terms of Exabyte growth kind of in the revenue growth and that's where I think there is a lot of good detail in terms of that side. If you want to call it segment of the business or market and generally speaking if you look at this last quarter both our growth, revenue growth, Exabyte growth, was generally in line with our previous expectations except for two things, capacity enterprise continues to push up to that 40% Exabyte growth that Mike talked about. And then also we saw a bit better of a PC market which helped us both in terms of our client SSD business as well as our hard drive business. And so really other than kind of a general rising of tides across the board, those were the only two segments that may be were a little bit better than what we expected. And if you can you repeat your second question, I don't remember that, well sorry.
Stanley Kovler: No, no problem. The second part of the question was as we think about Q1, I wanted to ask about the unit seasonality that we should think about for the NAND business and the HDD business because seems like if you are expecting better seasonality at least from enterprise perspective and PC perspective but units on the NAND side typically strong in Q1. So just trying to understand what the seasonality might have looked like between the two sides of the business there?
Steve Milligan: Yes, I think that let me talk. I'll give kind of an indication in terms of total units just from HDD perspective. The TAM came in this past quarter in terms of calendar Q4 at call it 112 million unit range. We would say that it probably would dropped to let's just call it 100 million unit range and pretty much all of that decline is largely due to the PC area. I mean in terms of from a unit perspective. And NAND we would expect to be seasonally down understanding that there hasn't tight supply. So you're going to see a little bit better demand than what you normally would see just from a sequential perspective as well as the fact as pricing continues to remain healthy. So that will help from an overall revenue perspective. So that's just some general guidance for you to kind of work from.
Stanley Kovler: Thanks. And if I could just follow-up, I wanted to ask about the consumer electronics and branded segment of HDDs, can you help us understand what the trends there it's a bit worsen seasonal, any product portfolio shift going on there, should we think about new products coming online in that area as we get throughout the year. Thanks a lot.
Mike Cordano: Yes, actually we really were operating within our expected range. I think we saw a little more strength on the flash side of the business driven by the same factors we talked about, but nothing unexpected there relative to either the HDD base or flash base part of that business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect, thanks. Congrats on the great quarter guys. I guess to start off with could you just may be talk about how much gross margin expansion do you still have from the cost takeout from HGST and SanDisk. I think it's a couple of hundred basis points that still lies ahead of you but could you guys help us quantify those two buckets. And if that's still ahead of you then could we operate in the 38% or 40% plus scenario provided the current supply demand dynamics sustain?
Steve Milligan: Yes that's a really good question. I have Mark kind of address the specifics but yes I fail to mention that when Sherry asked her question but yet we still have meaningful synergies. So we had particularly on the WD and HGST side. We also have some revenue synergies and then vertical integration synergies on the SanDisk side, but you are absolutely right. As those begin to kick in further that will certainly help us to maintain or improve our existing margin levels. So Mark is --
Mark Long: Let me just build on what Steve was saying. So as far as the COGS side from the HGST integration, we have achieved approximately half of the $350 million in run rate synergies that we expect to finish by the end of calendar 2017. So closing up this quarter we had approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and another $175 million to get. So you're about right in that ballpark.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough, that's very helpful and I guess may be just on the gross margin side, sequentially you guys are talking about revenues being down on 6%, 7%, 8% in the March quarter, gross margins are still reflecting higher, are they couple of things we would call out maybe it's mix or pricing that's helping but what's enabling such a big gross margin up tick when I would imagine as revenue deleverage?
Mark Long: Yes primarily mix and pricing and then we continue to make progress on our cost improvement operation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey thanks guys and congrats on the progress and on the strength of the quarter. I guess two quick ones for me. The first is I would love to get your view Steve on the likelihood of hammer products being introduced over the next couple of years. And if you do think there is a possibility for that. What I guess what how should we think about sort of the impact on economics that you guys would see both on the hard drive side and potentially on the SSD side? Thank you.
Steve Milligan: Yes so we talked about it in the Investor Day that we expect that hammer technology will be productized sometime in the 2019 timeframe. There has been no change in our expectations as it relates to ourselves and others have talked about may be earlier than that. But in terms of our expectations, it's 2019. Now to be perfectly honest about that in terms of the question, the second part of your question, I mean there is two things that we have to do is that we have to demonstrate the capability of the technology so from an area of density standpoint as well as from a reliability and manufacturing perspective. And we also have to enable that technology so that it's competitive from a cost standpoint. Obviously given that we're not productizing until 2019, we haven't demonstrated that. And our view is that we would look to implement it until the economics or the products makes sense from a commercial perspective and so at this point, we would expect it largely to not impact our financials in any material way in terms of our financial model and that sort of thing.
Ananda Baruah: Got it. That is helpful and then just real quickly, you made prepared remarks about revenue synergy benefit, I guess I was just wondering ultimately how do you guys view what the revenue synergy potential is from adding SanDisk to the portfolio, it occurs to ask simplistically that sort of alters now that you have a whole portfolio just alters the way that you can engage out with the majority of your important customers. And so I guess why would -- why wouldn't there be just super significant potential there over time, whatever over timing when you get it to sort of normalize to really drive very material benefit from that dynamic. Thanks.
Steve Milligan: I think you articulated our strategy very well and the benefits that we're actually seeing today and we expect to see on into the future as a result of our broad product portfolio and the way our teams are now able to engage differently with our customers. So we've seen great traction as Mike has talked about in terms of client SSDs as a great example but really this applies to the way, we manage the entire portfolio. So that's exactly how we see it and that's why we feel very good about our ability to achieve the near-term $500 million total synergy target that's the 18 months target after the deal. And then the longer-term I think it's $1.01 billion that we expected in 2020, so you're right on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Your closest competitor yesterday reported really significant unit and profit contribution from the non-PC, non-enterprise business that that you called consumer electronics and branded. Are you're not seeing that market do you share the view that new applications like surveillance and NAND will drive growth there and you just late to the party or what do you think the differential is because their business grew 20% sequentially, your business declined 20%?
Mike Cordano: Katy, let me comment on that, we are all like jumping at the bid to respond to that. We actually led the market in surveillance and so what's happening is that our largest competitor is now catching up to the party.
Steve Milligan: Right. So the other part goes to the way we classify this. So when we talk about our client solutions that is our retail branded business both flash and HDD base where things like surveillance show up is in our compliant devices business. So I think you'd expect similar trends that we saw relative to the strength of that business in our portfolio.
Katy Huberty: And can you talk about why over the last year surveillance has become aware of that of a driver of demand and how long do you think that plays out?
Mike Cordano: Well, that's I mean that's kind of I don't want to say difficult, I think that’s going to continue I mean obviously given in the world that we live in and I'm look at the geopolitical kind of thing I mean surveillance is a meaningfully growing part of the market and these are drives that are obviously optimized or those kind of used cases. And I think it's important to note that there will drives but before for surveillance applications may be in a smaller scale, they just want to optimize for those application. And so it does not necessarily mean that it is incremental growth in the overall HDD market it's just a matter of where they're been utilized.
Steve Milligan: Right and I think the positive trend that comes with that market sort of an HDD side is the capacity requirements we get a preferable mix we all benefit from that. The other thing you should think about is that surveillance market is not just the HDD base. So when you think about the broader ecosystem around surveillance depending on the system that close a bit certainly there is an HDD component of it but there is a very strong forward-looking demand that requires flash-based storage when you think about the cameras themselves things that sit on the edge.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Sierra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Rob Sierra: Hi, thanks very much and just kind of couple many comp mentioned at this stage one on your 3D NAND migration can you just is there any updates are or are you still looking at the same targets which I believe were the crossover on a bid basis in calendar 2017, is there any sense as you start working through when it that you exiting still calendar 2017 and same thing on a cost crossover 64-layer versus 2D. And then I guess finally you mentioned Fab6 I think your initial target for the crossover from a waiver standpoint 2018 is that reliant on Fab6. Thanks very much.
Steve Milligan: Yes, so few comments so, Rob yes I mean just a target about what we've to reaffirm what we've talked about in the past is that we expect that the cost crossover 0.4 of that's free technology that 64-layer 3D NAND will crossover against our 1G technology in the first half of calendar 2017 that remains the case, no change in that expectation at this point. And then the other thing is that what we had said historically is that approximately 50% of our total bid output for calendar 2017 will be 3D based. And obviously the majority of that will be 64-layer because that's what were transitioning to in terms of the cost crossover point. And so no real change on in our expectations in that regard. And I believe on the last conference call we've talked about, I think it was 40% of wafer, wafers out by the end of the year and that expectation remains the same.
Rob Sierra: All right. And then if I could just as look quick follow-up the again kind of confirmation you guys resolved the licensing deal with Samsung in the quarter with straight so that started to help the December quarter again for your positive guide next quarter. Any I mean and if you could give us from how much profit or margin or anything I think wasn't a meaningful help in the December quarter. Thanks.
Steve Milligan: No, in the December quarter was not a significant driver it helps. But we had a lot of underlying strength that really drove the overall performance. So it was a nice addition.
Mike Cordano: Yes and Rob just to be literal we don't have an intention on disclosing the dollar amount of that arrangement with Samsung.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. 
Mark Moskowitz: Yes, thanks good afternoon. I apologize I don't talk for few moments so if it's been asked I apologize but I want to understand firstly is there any area within the business right now in terms of mix that you easily you're out earning or may be seen outsized gains because of the NAND flash tighten as broadly speaking for the hard disk drive business and if so where is that in the cloud, the enterprise or other and didn't?
Steve Milligan: Repeat that again Mark, we want to make sure I understand the question, repeat that.
Mark Moskowitz: Yes, the question is I'm trying to understand because of what’s growing in the NAND market right now from a capacity constrain perspective has that allowed for any sort of displacement of this drives to slowdown or maybe you've seen resurgence if you will in your hard disk drive business with cloud or enterprise or other that may be is not sustainable or maybe it is not, that may be people recognize you can guys still lot of offer goodness in hard disk drive that as well that's my first question that makes sense.
Steve Milligan: Yes, sure Mike comment on that earlier. I'll let Mike.
Mike Cordano: So give you some specific I think the tightness is, is helping in the client space so, the fact that there is tightness of supply makes more opportunity in the near-term for HDD demand to satisfy the storage requirement of a PC. Potentially in a much more modest way in the performance enterprise space we talked about that relative to our sequential growth in performance enterprise but they don't. The more pronounced factor there was actually just that the yearend budget, seasonal demand for enterprise systems.  And on the, on the cloud side no real effect so, where we are shipping destroys as an industry that's a specific value proposition and that demand is real when ongoing so there is clear differentiation in the architecture as relative to where flash is utilized or where disk is utilize so, there is no sort of reverse displacement there.
Mark Moskowitz: Okay and then my second question is kind of an loading questions I'm going to asked in any way in terms of the cloud that the cloud buying patterns over the past few years have the time has been punctuated let them up and down or some pauses do you see this year ahead may be having less pause and actually just continue up cycle and if that is the case because of the combined model now of SanDisk and WD are you getting a more reception, get a reception from the cloud providers to do more are you getting more line to expand with those accounts and thereby can that actually continue to put upward pressure of one goodness on gross margin.
Steve Milligan: Let me answer it in the sequence the way you asked it. So I think relative to the buying behavior we've certainly always characterized this segment on a annualized basis for that reason. I think that was updated and increased our annual growth rate is an indication of our confidence now in going strength. We've talked previous conference calls around some of that reason that that's happening as their sort of fewer efficiency things happening in hyper scale whether they be operational or technological. We believe we continue to see more raw or base demand flowing through us for HD and micro. So we would expect that, that 40% growth for the current calendar year relative to the sort of the way we engage them I think we talked about this earlier we certainly benefit from the broad portfolio of products our ability to participate across both HDD and flash-based product offerings give us the unique position to work not only short-term relative to sort of business engagement. But also long-term as we think about long-range data center architectures in the future. So we have all the components we're uniquely positioned to have that conversation and we're already benefiting from that portfolio ultimately.
Steve Milligan: All right. So that's our last question, so I want to thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I now will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2016, our market positioning and growth opportunities, our strategic platform, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, the benefits of our short-term incentive compensation programs, our product portfolio, product features and their benefits, product transitions and other development efforts and customer acceptance of our products and manufacturing yields and cost improvements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable historical GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because material items that impact these measures are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-answer session part of our call today, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up to allow as many callers as possible during our allotted time. I thank you in advance for that. And I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. I'm pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category. We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand and our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter. We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly-combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, an increasing level of customer intimacy and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives. The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook. I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance, while, at the same time, successfully executing on two top priorities, namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the three companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track. I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned and we will begin a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017, as previously announced. Mike Cordano will now report on our business highlights in the September quarter.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution and the resulting business performance for the September quarter. The industry supply/demand environment in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technology base (7:06). Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabytes shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our near-line capacity HDDs, with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabytes shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry-leading 10 terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering. Just two weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform, with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate future magnetic recording technologies. In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for their new software-defined storage solution. In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs, as that market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our 3 bits per cell based embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones, as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to 2 bits per cell based alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3 bits per cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors. We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings. Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remains solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1 terabit SD card. From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15 nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect overall supply/demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant and we are focused on our offering industry-leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted costs and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to two re-pricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team. Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end-markets. Revenue in datacenter devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our datacenter revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs, as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs. Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC applications as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handsets. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better than anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvement resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter. Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy target. Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semiannual basis. We believe this semiannual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first six months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million. On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of €885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the two repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million, or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million, or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges. In the September quarter, we generated $440 million of cash from operations, with $210 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, compared to the June quarter end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt, consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt. As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017, and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. Now, I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results, and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million from $952 million to $863 million, our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information. With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense. While the September quarter is typically the high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamics and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key areas. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized one quarter in arrear. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement and will provide further updates as this situation changes. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first six months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs from the debt repricing and paydown transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95, with an estimated share count 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60. At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is (23:19) on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on your revenue beat. I see that your net revenue is 4% ahead of your pre-announcement, which only happened last month. So what kind of linearity trends you are seeing? Did the market trends accelerate towards the back half of the quarter?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. So for the quarter, linearity was very strong. And we experienced strong demand and favorable pricing since the guidance we provided in early September.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So if you look at it, of our revenue over-achievement from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion to the $4.7 billion, about 80% of that over-achievement was due to higher than expected demand and the balance was a bit better pricing.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you comment on your expectations for the NAND market bit growth as well as your bit growth? And then a bit on your expectations for pricing?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So talking about the current calendar year, we would expect that bit growth to be around the mid-30%, about 35% for the industry. And in our case, we had previously talked about something in the low-30% induced to some very good work by our operational teams that will be closer to the industry rate exiting this year. We'd expect next year to be in the mid-40%s, approximately 45%, both for the industry and for ourselves as we transition as an industry and we transition to 3D NAND technology.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. As we think about building our models and you look at the variable compensation components that are included in the expectations, how should we think about variable comp going into the December quarter? And I think at one conference, you had recently noted that that will start to tail off as you realize some of the synergies from these integrations, particularly HGST.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So the variable comp that is really driving the deltas here is our short-term bonus that's paid over a six-month horizon, as I was indicating earlier. And so for Q4, calendar Q4, we'll still have some of that effect. But as you go into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, that effect will be eliminated as we reset the target. And our forecast would include a normalized 100% target achievement there. So the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that, from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to really the end of fiscal 2017, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So, first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation. And then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first six months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year 2016, you would be deducting that overage, and then for the first half of calendar 2017, you would not have that short-term bonus effect.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I'm just curious on cloud pretty universally has been cited as strong across many different companies. I'm curious beyond the December quarter how you're currently thinking about cloud demand, near-line demand, in particular going into the first half of 2017?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Let me just follow up and give you another data point because we're conscious of the challenges modeling some of the transitions here. But when you think about the first quarter of calendar 2017, I want to kind of give you a perspective on where the normalized OpEx should range. And a way to think about that for modeling purposes would be in the $770 million range. So, hopefully, that helped.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: So, we wanted to close off that, Aaron, and Mike can talk about cloud demand.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Very helpful.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. All right. Relative to the cloud demand capacity enterprise, specifically I noted in my prepared remarks, we saw a year-over-year increase of nearly 50%. We see this year in total running around 38% or above our long-term model of 35%. As we look into calendar 2017, we're not updating our long-term model at this point. But, we would suggest that things will run to sort of a bias up above that kind of consistent with what we're seeing this year.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Mehdi Hosseini, thank you.
David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah, actually it's not Mehdi, it's David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini on the line. Thank you so much for taking the question. Can you guys talk about your HDD capacity in terms of units and/or exabytes? And what you've done in that regard and how that trend over the next quarters? And in that context, how we can think about capacity utilization? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So, this is Steve, I'll take that. So I would say that, I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So, there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products for various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we're going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the platter count. And we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if for one reason or another we would see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So, that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front.
David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up for Mark, how can we think about the cash conversion cycle, and more broadly speaking, like a normalized free cash flow rate as you've gotten your arms around the balance sheet and cash generation capability? Just any insight in how we can model that going forward. Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is inventory will likely trend up and this is really a function of us building strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business, the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So, that will trend upwards a little bit, but you'll then I think see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So, I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters, primarily as a function of our restructuring and ongoing integration activities. But, one of the things we will be doing during Investor Day is providing more visibility into the dynamics of that as well as a way to think about our long-term financial modeling and the key metric around cash flow generation.
David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, this is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. I just have a few questions here. Number one, can you just touch on what drove the gross margin upside? I think it was up about 60 basis points versus your positive pre and 160 basis points versus initial guide. Was this more HDD or NAND or cost integration, and some rank order would be valuable?
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So I think as we mentioned, the favorable pricing was across both parts of our business, but primarily in the NAND area. And we did experience some additional benefits from mix, especially given the fact that we had the first full quarter of the flash product revenue.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. And also the strong performance in terms of capacity enterprise as well.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: And I mean, there's a lot of dynamics. The other thing I'd just add is that we continue to make progress in terms of our integration synergy goals. So, that continues to provide some headwind – or not headwind, tailwinds for us in terms of our margin performance. So, it was really kind of oversimplified, it was kind of a little bit of everything, kind of across the board.
Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Thanks for that.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. Just to finish that thought, we would expect those same drivers to carry forward into the second fiscal quarter and that's driving the expansion of gross margin.
Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. And as a follow-up, I understand that you're only including about 45 days of that Samsung contribution, which makes sense. If or when you get a resolution with Samsung, would they back pay your payments from November 15 onwards or...
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: We would certainly hope so, yes, because the agreement expired on August 14. So when we put a new agreement in place, we would expect it to be retroactive to that date.
Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
James Kisner - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. So I believe you said near-line demand was up 50% year-over-year in exabytes shipped. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on how that translates to revenue change year-over-year, and I guess, related to that, change in price per bit year-over-year. And I guess relatedly, have you seen a more rational competitive environment for near-line and what has happened to your share in near-line quarter-on-quarter? Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: So from a translation to a revenue standpoint, it's about half that in terms of the increase in revenue.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. In terms of market dynamics, I think we think it's fairly balanced and as we expected. And I think relative to total bit participation, we think we've improved our position sequentially and we see a trend of that going forward really relative to our increasing sales of our 10 terabyte offering.
James Kisner - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just getting back to your revenue guidance for a second, I was wondering if there's any other puts and takes you can talk to in terms of how you get to the flat, either by the three business segments you've established or maybe even hopefully by some product categories as well? And then I had an enterprise follow-up question.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: Sure. So let me talk about our end-markets. For datacenter devices, you can think about that whole category being roughly flat. When it comes to client devices, I think within that, while the whole category again will be roughly flat, you'll have some puts and takes. You'll see continued strength in client SSD, but we'll see gaming and, to some extent, notebook HDDs sort of come off that seasonal peak and then we'll see a little strength in desktop. When it comes to our client solutions, we actually see strength across both our HDD and flash-based products. So I think on balance, it's flat to slightly up for each of the three categories.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: The largest single variable there is that seasonality of the gaming marketplace, so that peaks, as Mark said, in calendar Q3. So that's the largest single variable within that.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, as you mentioned, you have a unique view into enterprise storage now. I was wondering if you could just compare average capacity trends between HDDs and SSDs into some of the cloud data centers that you have projects in and how the growth rates compare and contrast. Thank you very much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, on a growth rate basis, the capacity growth rate for flash exceeds that of disk. And so that trend continues. That's been ongoing for some time and that's really specifically related to hyperscale deployments.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question for me, tagging onto that last question. So Micron, for example, has been touting its 15 terabyte drive. And I'm just interested in, may be best from Mike, how do you see the next few years playing out on the highest capacity points between hard drives and SSDs? How do you position these two? And does WD get to a point where it just is indifferent to whatever people select for cloud hyperscale environments? Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah. So I think, Rich, it still begins with the workload and then the cost per bit that optimally supports that workload. So going forward, we don't see a convergence to an all-flash world anytime soon, frankly, anytime in our planning horizon. So what we do see is continued growth of capacity enterprise that we articulated. That's going be long into the future, although flash revenue and flash bits on a proportionate basis is growing faster. So from that standpoint, that's the trend we would point you to. And they have very different purposes in the hierarchy. So we continue to obviously work closely with those and are innovating around data center architectures and we intend to deploy our technology and our products in an optimal way to those trends.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: How much of a price differential is there today between the SSD version and a comparable capacity hard drive?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: It varies depending on performance requirements, et cetera, but it would run between 5X and 10X.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I apologize if the questions have been asked. I've been jumping between a couple calls. The first question is, can you talk a little more about next year if demand improvement in both flash and disk drives continue from an end market perspective, could we see any capacity cuts driving a shortage or a constraint issue next year from one or both segments? And the other question is around the exclusion of stock options. Can you talk a little more about the philosophy there, just given that we were aware of SanDisk and the overhang there previously, why the change now and what's the impetus? That would be great. Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Okay. Let me talk about the supply/demand environment. We said publicly and we'll reiterate here that we see constrained supply in the NAND side of our business through calendar year 2017. And that's primarily driven by two things, end market demand for that class of technology and the rate and pace of the industry's conversion to 3D NAND. Relative to the hard drive market, I think at this point we would see that as a normal or balanced environment.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: And then, Mark, with respect to the decision to exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results, we really had two primary drivers. One was just the way we run the business. And our stock-based compensation expense actually has some elements of it that are either short term in nature or are variable. And as a result, it injects some variability that undermines our ability to demonstrate or track the improvements we're making from a synergy realization standpoint. So that's the first driver. The second driver is that we are more and more focused on our cash flow generation and looking at our results from a cash standpoint, particularly given our balance sheet. And by excluding the stock-based compensation, we are better able to highlight and track the cash flow impact of our operating decision.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Now, one thing, Mark, that I will add to that. This is Steve. Is that we fully recognize the fact that there is an impact in the form of dilution from stock-based compensation and we remain not only aware of that, but sensitive of that. And if you look at our proxy statement in terms of compensation philosophies and that sort of thing, there's no change in that regard in terms of what we're doing. It's more a matter of excluding those figures to provide more meaningful analytical information, if you want to call it that, to the financial community. But I don't want people to think that we don't recognize the fact that there is a dilution component as it relates to our existing shareholders.
Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.: And Mark, I think as you know, part of the calculus was looking at the comparable peers. And what they do to try to provide an easier basis for comparison, so.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I know it's difficult to guide NAND gross margins since ASPs are beyond your control. But do you think your cost improvement will be above or below your long-term expectations of 20% in 2016 as you ramp 3D? And maybe, what's your expectation in 2017, calendar 2017, as 3D becomes a larger part of your mix? And I have a follow up, please.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Okay. So we've talked about sort of the cost reduction domain of kind of three generations – or three periods in the NAND industry. Very early on, it was running at around a 50% annualized rate. The next period was running at about a 30% rate. Frankly, that's now ending as we come to the conclusion of plainer NAND. As we move fully as an industry into 3D, once we're through the transition, we expect around a 20% per year cost reduction capability. So, that's the way we would guide you to think about that. Obviously, there are some perturbations as we transition from 2D to 3D, but that's the way to think about it from a long-term modeling perspective.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. I can appreciate that. And then in the context of your bit growth outlook for calendar 2017 that you just gave and also your past comments that 3D NAND will be 40% of your overall bit output by the end of next calendar year, should we expect the majority of your 3D outlook to be 64-layer or will it be more weighted toward 48-layer?
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: It will be 64-layer. And I think we have – what's the right number for exit rate in 2017?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: It's around 40%, but its wafers out.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Oh. Okay. So not bit output, it's just wafers out? Okay. So the 40% is wafers out.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Correct. And the other comment I'll make, just to clarify, 48-layer, we've talked about, is really a learning node for us. So, to just reiterate what Steve said, the volume as we exit next calendar year will be predominantly the 64-layer.
Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Hi, guys. Hey, congratulations and thanks for taking the question. One and then a quick follow up. Steve, would love your, I guess, your context on given that on the hard drive side of things, the capacity in the industry is pretty well rationalized, and I guess, has the potential based on cloud growth going into next year to maybe be, it sounds fantastic, but close to 100% by midyear. What implications, if any, does that then have on, I guess, the context, the tenor of your relationships with customers, your conversations with customers, business practices with customers in any regard? Would love to get your sense there and then I have a quick follow up on a different topic.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Well, yeah, and Mike can help me with this as well, but I think that one of the things that has really happened over a period of time, because as the hyperscale guys grow, and they get bigger, and as they need to add capacity and their growth is accelerating. And so you just get into, call it, the law of large numbers. We have to do a much better job working with the hyperscale guys on longer-term capacity planning. And so, we believe we've done a good job on that because we don't – they don't want to ask us for product and us not have it. And then, clearly, we don't want to gap out on them. And so, it's driven in effect a much more close-knit planning process, longer-term planning process, which the good side of that is that it allows for a little bit more predictability in terms of what's going on in that side of the business, because there was a time – well, it can still happen. But there's been conversations about the lumpiness of the business and that can still occur. But because of the dynamics that we're seeing, we're actually getting into a little bit more longer-term planning and a little bit more predictability in terms of what's happening from a demand perspective. Mike can kind of add to that.
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Yeah, and I'll just sort of reiterate some of the reasons this is. So, we've talked about this long-term growth rate of 35%. We've been, as an industry, achieving that with a number of efficiency factors flowing through. We've highlighted in the past both technological as well as operational. So, technologically, things like erasure coding are widely deployed now in that infrastructure. So, the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that has sort of run its course. The other one is operational efficiency and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units, their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their fleet. Those processes are maturing. So, really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: And Steve and Mike, was sort of working more closely with those folks, would that include anything in the context of contractual alterations? Could a long-term – I'm just coming up off the top of my head, long-term contracts play into it in any context, maybe capital sharing play into it in any context, anything with financial implications?
Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.: Well, I'll say this. I think the general view of us now as we put together this broader set of assets is we're more relevant, we're more strategically important, and our engagement is changing with the broader marketplace. So, things along those lines and other strategic things are all sort of more possible now.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Got it. Thanks so much.
Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.: Thank you. So, I want to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on December 6. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016, our market positioning, expectations regarding our transformation, growth opportunities, near-term priorities, long-term business model, and strategy execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts, and customer acceptance of our products, data growth and its drivers and our wafer capacity. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC on May 9, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable historical GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. I also want to call to your attention the quarterly fact sheet posted on our Investor Relations section of our website has been updated to reflect enhancements to our reporting, including the breakout of revenues and exabytes shipped to three end markets: data center devices and solutions, client devices and client solutions. The definitions of these three end market categories can be found in the quarterly fact sheet. In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their questions. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights. Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials, and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter. Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets. Given unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the marketplace. We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees. With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution. I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity, focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet. We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology roadmaps involving legacy WD, HGST, and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the New Fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership. We announced our next generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, with an industry leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced, and we expect meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017. And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition. We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile and addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers. I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device, and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision. Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product roadmaps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees. Coupled with a series of restructuring actions, we have taken over the last two years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of two facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore. Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facilities footprint by almost one fifth and our head count by almost one quarter over the last two fiscal years. Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results, in HDDs we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year on year basis, primarily driven by shipments of our capacity enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth in our capacity enterprise product line was 47% on a year on year basis, faster than the market growth rate thanks to the ongoing success of our Helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10 terabyte product to high volume, our third generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum. In enterprise SSDs, we saw strength in sales in both enterprise and cloud customers. From a client devices perspective, we are benefiting from the growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HDD unit shipments decline year-over-year. In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry leading 15 nanometer technology remained the workhorse and that accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 15 nanometer technologies set another record and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve. Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our three bit per cell, or X3 architecture, delivering the industry's smallest 256 gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost reduction capabilities beyond our 15 nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2. And this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail, as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets. From a wafer fab standpoint, in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies, for the rest of the year we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for total industry bit supply growth, as we had previously indicated. However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable a mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry. Switching to the near term, we believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following, new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business along with seasonality. Additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs, even as PC unit volumes shrink. We are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology. And we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash markets such as mobile, and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business. Offsetting these factors, we have seen share driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5 inch HDD market and the 8 terabyte capacity point in capacity enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas. Our fiscal Q4 performance and forwarded guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account. To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is very unique in our industry. A combination of WD, HGST, and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q4 financial results.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mike. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.5 billion. Including the partial payout of SanDisk ownership, our non-GAAP gross margin was 31% and operating expenses totaled $691 million. Interest and other expense for the quarter included $181 million of interest expense related to the debt for the SanDisk acquisition. Non-GAAP tax benefit for the June quarter was $24 million due to the impact of interest expense related to the SanDisk acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $208 million or $0.79 per share. In the June quarter, we generated $355 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $114 million. Our net CapEx totaled $241 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $8.2 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion was held in the US. After the close of the June quarter and, as Steve mentioned earlier, we utilized $3 billion to pay off the bridge loan. Finally, I would like to thank Steve and the rest of the leadership team at Western Digital, our employees, and the investment community for your partnership and support over the last two years during my tenure as CFO. As I leave Western Digital to pursue other opportunities, I am confident in Mark's leadership to guide the finance and strategy organization and the company through the transformation that we have undertaken. Mark?
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Thank you, Olivier. It is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I have been with the company and in the industry for many years. Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward. With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies. Today we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of three primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these three end markets. Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value including revenue and exabytes shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mix-up strategies for our NAND and HDD products respectively. We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top ten customers, enterprise SSDs, and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today. In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market for value creation drivers and our historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for a transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year. At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business. I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance costs over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next five years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make. Second, due to purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. And our first question comes from the line of Sherry Scribner with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I just was a little confused about the yen commentary that you made about the hedges. Can you maybe explain where that's going to sit and why that changed? And can you also help us understand what the impact of the yen will be going forward and how we should think about that for earnings. Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Sure, Sherry. So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instruments. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gains. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would have had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for the change in reporting due to purchase accounting. With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Sherry, just this is Steve. Just to add one comment to that. I think that it's important to note, and we've gone through this in terms of our legacy hard drive business. There is always a number of different areas that create potential volatility in our business. It's our job from a management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet, and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact, I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results. And I think it's important to emphasize that fact.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. A couple questions. I guess first when it comes to the OpEx, I assume that going forward you're just going to give a combined number for OpEx. Is there any sense you could give us today on the breakdown between the two business lines? And should we assume that from $875 million that it declines at some pace over the balance of fiscal 2017? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So Rich, this is Steve. So the first thing is, is that we will only be providing total OpEx guidance going forward. We will not be providing, if you want to call it, separate legacy WDC or legacy SanDisk. As we move through the integration process, it will become kind of impossible to do that because we'll be combining – we're in the process of combining the companies. And then your assumption is correct that as we move through, one, through the tail end of calendar 2016 and into 2017 as we begin to realize synergies, we will see our OpEx begin to decline absent other investments that we need to make to continue to innovate in our business.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Then maybe this is best for Mike. Can you give us any sense on the high cap demand environment, in particular what the hyperscale build-out plans are over the next call it three to six months? Are you confident that the share, the overall share you've got should improve with the 10 terabyte as an example?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I think that trend relative to overall share should be favorable with the adoption of the 10 terabyte. We also see the trend of petabyte growth moving to the high end of the range. So we would see the general demand situation in that group of customers as being steady and running at a slightly to the high end of the petabyte growth range, so approaching 40% is what you got to think about.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, and thank you, Olivier, and congratulations, Mark.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. How should we think about the trajectory of gross margins from here, in not just the September quarter as the purchase accounting hit rolls off? It's a better pricing environment given the tighter NAND supply. And then how negative is the impact of ramping 3D NAND when you take those factors together? How should we just think from a high level about the trajectory of gross margins? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Katy. So to make a few comments. One thing just to, I'll call it, remind everybody is when we do the December 6 Investor Day, we'll obviously be providing updated margin range. We'll also be talking more qualitatively about the hierarchy of our margins between the three different, the slices of revenue that we're providing, data center as well as client devices, et cetera. And so we will be providing additional color going forward. Relative to the trajectory of our margins, it's a little bit early to make a call on that because there's obviously a lot of variables going on, which we sort of alluded to in Mike's commentary. So I don't want to get too over my skis in terms of forecasting of where we think our margins are going to trend. So I'll leave it at that.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. The first question, and I have a follow-up real quick, you talked about the progression of the synergies and moving forward favorably on that front. I'm curious as you look specifically at the Hitachi integration and I think the target was exiting this year at $475 million of realized synergies, where did you come out this quarter with regard to realizing that level of synergies? And how do we think about the progression as we look through fiscal 2017?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll take that and then Olivier or Mark can comment. First off, we are on track to achieving the synergy targets that we set for ourselves as well as outlined externally. We were not specific when we did that as to how that would reflect itself from a quarterly basis. We talked about where we would end up in terms of calendar 2016 as well as in calendar 2017. I believe that we suggested to the investment community that you use some sort of I'll call it straight-line projection in that regard. And I would say that generally speaking, that's about where we're at. But we're on track to our calendar year-end synergy targets.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then a real quick follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the variables we should consider with regard to free cash flow generation as we move out over the next several quarters? What specifically CapEx trends we should think about?
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: So for the CapEx considerations, I think it's important to remember what the CapEx requirements were for each of the separate businesses and then we can think about them on a combined basis. So we were looking at 5% to 7% of revenue from the HDD business, although we were running a little below that. And then for cash CapEx for the SanDisk business, they were running in the 8% to 10% range. On a combined basis, I think it would be safe to look at something in the 6% to 8% range for planning purposes.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then I would just add in terms of free cash flow, one of the things that we will be doing again in conjunction with the December Investor Day is resetting what we see as our cash conversion targets. We've got a bit more work to do on that as we increase our understanding and also look for optimization opportunities in terms of the combined business. And obviously with the profit ranges and in terms of margin, OpEx, et cetera, that will allow for a better modeling of where we think our free – operations cash flow will turn out. And then you would back off the CapEx from that to be able to estimate what our free cash flow would be going forward.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Right. And we tried to provide you with visibility into our cash interest expense by highlighting what we were amortizing in terms of the debt discount and issuance expenses. So I think you have the drivers of our free cash flow laid out.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Congrats on a solid quarter. Olivier, we'll miss working with you. And, Mark, welcome. Two if I could, guys. I guess a little bit of an old school question. Steve, what's your TAM view for the second half of the year, calendar year now that the TAM was a little bit firmer than we all thought or at least you guys thought it might be entering the quarter? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so, Ananda, I would say that in terms of – I'm not going to make a call on the back half in terms of quantitatively, obviously. I'm going to give you a very dissatisfying answer. We would expect that the TAM will be higher in the second half than it was in the first half as a general statement. But more specifically as it relates to calendar Q3, our fiscal Q1, I would say that we would expect the hard drive TAM to be in the range of about 110 million units.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Okay. Okay. Great. No, that's actually very helpful in both regards. So and then the follow-up for me is just with regards to the near line commentary that you made, it sounds like you're expecting pretty solid near line demand in the second half of the year. I think the comment with regards to the 10 terabyte Helium ramping was you expect to, was it gain share as you go through that process? If you could clarify that. And then I guess a follow-on to that was I'd love your view on sort of where normalized share is on 8 terabyte since Seagate obviously seemed to get some meaningful volume back in the June quarter. Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, first is seasonality. We see it slightly higher, sort of a 48/52 on across the calendar year relative to petabyte linearity in the year. So heavier in the back half than the first. Yeah, I think my statements around 10 terabyte were interpreted correctly. I think we have ceded, as you might expect, some 8 terabyte share as our major competitor ramped. We think we're in a leading position on 10 terabyte, which will benefit us in the back half of the year.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the other thing that I would add is we are not expecting to cede any more share.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your guide and your commentary about a tight NAND supply, how should we think about the NAND ASP assumption that is dialed in? And is that a realistic assumption? Or if the tightness were to sustain, would there be a upside from a NAND ASP side? And I have a follow-up.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I'll comment a little bit. Well, two things. One is we see the tightness through the end of the year, so that will have a benefit relative to bit price. We won't comment on the specifics of that. The way we also see it a little longer term, and this really relates to a new industry model, if you will, is the rate of bit cost decline is going to move into a regime that will center around a 20% or so per year we think. Barring supply/demand dynamics, that's the way the broader market should begin to look at the industry as we proceed into the 3D NAND era.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. Great. And since you mentioned next year and the mix of BiCS3 BIX 3, I'm just trying to better understand your strategy. And I do realize you're going to have an Analyst Day in December, but if the mix of BiCS3 is going to exceed your product expectation or going to have a higher mix of the 64 layer, do you foresee a scenario where you would better able to price your SSDs, or is that going to better help your raw NAND customer? How should we think about these mix shift and its impact to your product offering?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, my comment on part of this, but let me make one thing clear. Part of the strategy that SanDisk had and accordingly our strategy, which oh by the way, we concurred with, is that we want to manage technology transitions when it makes sense from a cost standpoint. So it, right now, we have the leading 2D planar technology from a cost standpoint. So we want to intersect 3D NAND technology when we think it is cost competitive to the incumbent 2D NAND technology. We believe that that will occur with our BiCS3 technology. And so, and we're pleased with the progress. We've still got a lot of work that we've got to do to go make that happen. And, but that's where we believe with 64 layers, that's where we believe that that cost crossover point will begin to occur, and we'll be ramping accordingly when that takes place through 2017. So I'll have Mike comment from kind of a product perspective.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, so in addition to sort of the general base of cost advantage that Steve just described, it really allows us to allocate sooner and a larger amount of 3D NAND into our broad product base. So we're going to apply it where it gives us most value first, which are our higher density applications or products. So you can imagine what those are, both classes of SSD and certain classes of off-embedded will benefit directly from that. So our ability to bring those products into the market sooner and at higher volume is the general way to think about that.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Great. And I just wanted congratulate Olivier and best of luck in his next endeavor.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mehdi.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Steve and Mike, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the underlying business patterns for both SSD and HDD. Especially, Steve, given your comment around the 110 million TAM for September. Can you talk about the puts and takes in terms of where maybe you're seeing some signs of life and renewal of the TAM (40:32) versus maybe some areas of challenge? And the same thing for the SSD piece. And then, Mark, I do appreciate the direction in the message in terms of around a more holistic reporting down the road, so we all look forward to that. I had a question though in terms of the gross margin. Could you talk a little about how we should think about the gross margin in the near to midterm? Is there any business that's going to be underperforming or out-earning before we get to the December Analyst Meeting on the margin side?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So you want to take it?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So Mike can take the color on the 110 million TAM.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, so just thinking about it, I think the things to think about by segment, PC growth has moderated in terms of the declines. We've seen that flatten out. That's helpful as we enter into the second half as we see normal seasonality give us a little bit of a boost. I talked already about what our thoughts are around capacity enterprise. That will continue to be an area of growth within the hard drive segment. The other area to comment on is performance enterprise. We do see that continuing to have pressure from SSD. So there's been a downward trend in that market. We expect on a year over year basis something in the 25% range. And then lastly, gaming is up seasonally given the traditional holiday seasons, the current quarter is a high volume quarter for gaming. So that's a way to kind of dimension the HDD world. Within the broader solid state markets, I think I made reference to this in my comments. We're really seeing strong demand across all segments: embedded, client SSD, and ESSD or enterprise SSD. It's sort of as expected, but growth continues.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and just a comment on our margins, then I'll ask Mark to add a comment about a little bit about the hierarchy of our margins. But I want to impress one point, that all of our margins by product continue to perform consistent with our expectations and what we would consider to be our own internal margin ranges. So no issues in terms of that, but I'll ask Mark to talk about kind of the hierarchy of our margins.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Sure. Mark. So basically when we look at the hierarchy of gross margin, the highest performing area for us is in the data center devices and solutions. Then that's followed by our client solutions, and then the third kind of level in the hierarchy is client devices. And as Steve pointed out, we are seeing the expected performance in each of those categories.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two for me as well.
Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations: Hey, we can't hear you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can't hear you.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hopefully this is better.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's better.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I guess two questions. One, Mike, you talked about this 20% cost per bit decline as you go forward. Could you achieve that on the planer NAND side as well and would you have to go down half a node to get there in the next few quarters essentially or was that more a long-term comment you were making?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: That's a long-term commentary and it's enabled by the 3D NAND transition in both initially and then subsequent generations.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then I guess can you guys talk about the Samsung licensing revenues? Is the expectation that – SanDisk was getting that obviously – but is your expectation that that holds firm as you go forward and it gets renewed, or do you think that rolls off to a lower number at some point?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, a few clarifying comments. I mean first off, we nor SanDisk have historically disclosed the amount of the royalty from Samsung. The additional thing is, is that the current royalty arrangement is up for renewal and we're in discussions with Samsung regarding the terms of that renewal. I have nothing to report in terms of the status of that other than we're currently discussions with them. And then the additional point that I will make, which we talked about as part of the acquisition, is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were I will call it relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought, so we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from a future financial modeling perspective.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.
John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. Hey, something a little mundane. Tax rate going forward, I know you guided to 20% to 25% for fiscal 2017 and 10% to 15% for fiscal 2018. Is that still what your thinking is, or can you narrow that range a little for us?
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: Well, as we pointed out, we will be providing a much more fulsome financial model at our Analyst Day in December. But I think it's safe to assume that the ranges we provided for the guidance will actually be slightly lower. And for fiscal 2017, we think it will be something in the range of 15% to 20%.
John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.
Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about your plans for production capacity going forward, especially in light of the TAM going up again next quarter. How should we think about where the industry capacity and specifically your capacity needs go particularly as we exit 2017 if there could be more pressure on PC units in particular? Are we thinking that may be going down to a 45 million sort of capacity level for you is something that could be additive to the cost synergies out there as well? And then again a related cost question, but on the SanDisk side. If we got the OpEx numbers right for WD standalone, it seems like the guidance for next quarter implies that the SanDisk OpEx is going up. I just wanted to see if you can provide a little bit more color on that. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so one of the things that – the first question has to do with HDD capacity, so just to comment on that. One of the things that Mike said, we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out both in the form of brick and mortar as well as in terms of head count to react to the decline that we have seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our head count over the course of the last two years. We also have, we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to one third and when you look at from two years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can. Obviously our margins in terms of what we reported on the hard drive sides shows that we have done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx, but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior for fiscal Q4. Next question?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you. Is there anything you can offer on free cash expectations for 2017 after doing a little over $100 million last quarter? And with that, anything to offer as far as your thoughts behind the projected debt paydown schedule? Even qualitatively would be great. Thanks.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: So in terms of free cash flow, we're going to provide updated guidance in December. So I think that's the soonest we'll give you more granularity. But in terms of our debt paydown schedule, I think it's safe to assume we're going to be aggressive where we can be to pay that down as quickly as we can. Our long-term commitment remains the three to five-year horizon getting to 1.5 times leverage. And as I mentioned, as we can find ways, whether it's our cash conversion cycle or other operational improvements that generate more free cash flow, we will look to use that to delever the balance sheet.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. And then quickly on the legacy hard drive business, apologize if this was covered already, but the gap up in consumer units during the quarter, what drove that?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The gap up. What do you mean by gap up?
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: I think it went from 7 million units to 10 million sequentially, big sequential move. I must have the wrong numbers.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure what you're referring to.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Consumer HDD is 7.3 million in the March quarter, 10 million in the June quarter.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that would be gaming.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Gaming. It's all gaming.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ana Goshko with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks very much. First I wanted to clarify, on the CapEx guidance ranges that you gave, that includes incremental contributions into the flash JVs. Is that true?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yes. Yes, it does. That's our cash CapEx range that we provided.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then in the quarter, it looks like there was a $90 million contribution. What's the expectation on the SanDisk side for the CapEx that's at SanDisk proper? And how much do you expect to contribute into the JV going forward?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be implied in that 6% to 8%. Beyond that, we won't be providing specifics.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then secondly, I think the largest piece of the synergy case between the SanDisk/Western combination was the vertical integration on the NAND supply side. And I wanted to get an update on when you think you'll be able to start realizing that.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I think as we stated, we're going to do that through product life cycle adjustments. So we are not going to retroactively go back to existing products shipping to customers. So that's going to happen over the course of time. And really largely sort of 18 months and beyond we'll start to see that take more effect.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then this may be mundane, but I don't know if I caught a depreciation and amort projection for this coming quarter.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't believe that we provided one.
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: We did not.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Can I get one?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No.
Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Okay. Thank you, then.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Anything on the long awaited transition to energy assisted magnetic recording? Is that 2017, or that keeps on getting pushed out?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say it's 2018, 2019 kind of dynamic.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay. So it's fallen out. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please check your mute button, Vijay.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah, hey. Sorry about that. Just on the OpEx level, where do you see the long-term OpEx level? I know it's $875 million here. Where do you see it longer term?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's an additional item that we'll be providing more color on in December. We're still scrubbing through the details.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And on the gross margin line, what are the puts and takes as you look out? What drives it? Where do you see upside coming from as we look out couple of quarters here?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well that's a very general question. And so, again, we'll be providing more information in December in terms of our gross margin range. But obviously the puts and takes, it's going to be dependent upon the usual things, what happens with mix, what happens with pricing, what happens with demand. Obviously right now in terms of what Mike was alluding to, we've got a favorable supply/demand situation in terms of NAND. That's helping our margin profile from an overall perspective. And hard drive market is relatively stable, certainly from a demand perspective. But as Mike alluded to, we continue to see some share-based pricing behavior in certain parts of the market that's kind of offsetting maybe some of the more positive things that we're seeing in terms of mix and demand on the hard drive side. So there's various different puts and takes. But on balance, we see at least in the near term an upward trajectory from 31% to 32% in terms of our gross margin percentage.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: All right. And just last question here on the yen. I might have missed the first part of that, but were you mentioning the unrealized hedging gains in the yen? Do you expect that to – does that flow through the EPS line in coming quarters or how do you see that $35 million (sic) [$26 million] (56:01) and $17 million in [indiscernible] (56:07)?
Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer: So first of all, let me clarify. That is just purchase accounting. So it will not flow through the P&L for Q1 and Q2 and beyond for the instruments that we had at the time of the closing of the transaction. So all our new hedging instruments will flow through in the customary manner. Now, we still get the cash benefit of those instruments, but you will see effectively it's what would otherwise have been a decrease in the next few quarters as a result of that purchase accounting requirement.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Best of luck. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask you about the operating expenses in the fourth quarter? Because combined, those were about $484 million. In the coming quarter, you've guided to $875 million. So what were the unusual charges or if any, within those two line items.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Nothing unusual. And again, the complexity with the guide is you compare a full quarter with a quarter not including obviously SanDisk for the full period. And as we indicated earlier, the incentive compensation now will be fully funded, which wasn't the case before. So the reconciliation is a bit tricky. But nothing out of the ordinary.
David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So the current quarter was $484 million of op expenses including $70 million of stock comp. And so the next quarter will be $875 million, and I guess we'll have a lower component of stock comp.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So stock-based compensation is excluded from all the numbers we are communicated.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's included. You'll have a full quarter, so it will actually be higher stock comp. We'll repeat the answer. The primary difference between F Q4 and F Q1 OpEx is having a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx plus a higher level of incentive compensation funding. That's the primary difference.
David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): But wouldn't that be – so that should be a bigger number than a smaller number. Isn't that? What am I missing?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll have to take this offline, okay?
David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Thank you. The exabytes shipped, does that include the NAND flash component now?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Repeat that. I'm sorry.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: The exabytes shipped, the 66.1 in the June quarter, does that include the NAND flash shipments as well?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: It does. Okay. So there was an acceleration on a year over year growth, so is that primarily attributable to the inclusion of NAND flash?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It would be primarily driven by capacity enterprise shipments.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is that you had about $100 million upside relative to the original midpoint guidance. And given the ASP uptick, which I think is due to the mix shift to the capacity enterprise, it sounds like it was largely capacity enterprise that drove all this. And could you give some additional color as far as where that demand from capacity enterprise was? It sounds like it's hyperscale, but just want to make sure it's just hyperscale and there's no upside from the enterprise storage OEMs as well.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, just to make an overall comment, because remember we provided guidance prior to the acquisition of the SanDisk, which SanDisk which was obviously legacy WDC. Our financial results for F Q4 for legacy WDC came in largely consistent with our expectations. So primarily the upside that we saw was driven by if you want to call it legacy SanDisk or our new flash-based business over that stub period.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: I see. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. All right. So I want to thank you for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank Olivier Leonetti for his contributions as our Chief Financial Officer over the last two years. We greatly appreciate Olivier's dedication during this transformative time and wish him the best in the future. We look forward to staying in touch with our investors in the analyst community in the weeks and months ahead. Thank you.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Financial Results for the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal: Thank you. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management's current expectations, and include known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors many of which Western Digital is unable to predict or control that may cause Western Digital's actual results, performance or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. This call does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in connection with the pending acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital filed the Form S-4 registration statement with the SEC which was declared effective by the SEC on February 5, 2016 and Western Digital filed the definitive proxy statement/prospectus on February 5, 2016, which was mailed to Western Digital and SanDisk stockholders on or about that day. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully, because it contains important information about the acquisition. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor section of our website. The information provided during this call regarding the savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of the WD and HGST subsidiaries, and the expected cost to achieve such savings will also be included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the IR section of our website following the conclusion of this call. And I'll now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries. I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track, having received shareholder approval in March, and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition, the last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition. Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the standalone guidance we're providing today, to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter. Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter, given continued softer PC demand and weaker than expected demand in performance enterprise. We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter, by continuing to take costs out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix. We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices, storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures. It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they are carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions anticipates these and other trends. After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and non-volatile memory. Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter. Olivier?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million. Non-GAAP tax (6:43) expense for the March quarter was $26 million, or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $283 million or $1.21 per share. In the March quarter, we generated $485 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $352 million. Our CapEx totaled $133 million or 5% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S. I will now provide an update on cost savings initiatives as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly factsheet posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimates of the savings on our last earnings conference call in late January. Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017 versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which two-third will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50/50 split between the two years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017. For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017 with a 50/50 split between the two years. As a reminder, these savings would provide us with the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these sayings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter, operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's standalone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial period of ownership of SanDisk in the June quarter. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Olivier. I wanted to clarify on your OpEx savings. I think you said OpEx would now be at a run rate of $460 million. Is that what you said going forward after these savings from MOFCOM? And then, just thinking about the savings, where are these coming from? Why do you think you're able to get so much more savings from the synergies between Western Digital and Hitachi? Thanks.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the saving to be achieved after two years will reach an amount of $450 million. That's an annual number. To help you in your modeling, we will expect, as a result, at the end of calendar year 2016 quarterly OpEx of being $495 million and at the end of 2017, an amount in Q4 of $460 million. Those savings come from a range of activities ranging from rationalization in R&D, in G&A mainly for OpEx.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sherri, we're basically eliminating redundancies where we've got redundant functions between the two entities. And also just why has the number changed? Obviously, when a large part of the hold separate was lifted, we had estimates of what those savings would look like. And as we progress through the integration process, we're able to refine those estimates and have more specific numbers to provide not only for ourselves, but for the investment community.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just clarifying on the debt, when do you close the debt to buy SanDisk and how should we think about that as an interest rate, because it looks like it's impacting EPS a little bit more than I would have thought? So it seems like you'll close that before the deal happens. Thanks.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So all the financing is complete. So the $18.1 billion we needed to raise has been raised and it's either committed by banks or sold to investors. So we expect to come back to you with all the details associated with the interest and time of reimbursement and so on, as we close the transaction which will be, as we said, during Steve prepared remarks in the June quarter.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And Sherri, just to clarify, the EPS estimate that we provided does not include the impact of interest expense associated with the acquisition.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So when we give updated financial views, we didn't want to do, I'll call it a half a loaf, right? So when we closed the transaction or shortly thereafter, we will provide an updated view for the sub period for our fiscal Q4, which will include the impact of SanDisk's business on us, any purchase accounting impacts and interest expense. So it will be a full-on view for calendar Q2.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: One additional comment on the debt, obviously, the cost of the debt for secured bond and unsecured bond is public. But we wanted to say that the average rate for the total debt will be significantly lower than the rate of the bonds and will come back to you in short order.
Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. That clarifies. Thank you very much.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions. If you could just talk first, Steve, you did start to touch on the weakness in PCs and enterprise, but if you could just elaborate on both the demand and pricing trends by category and then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll comment on it, and then, Mike Cordano may want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called 100 million unit TAM and came in at whatever, 99.8, that's our estimate, right? We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet. And within that, I would say that the PC market, obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now, that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit, because we've been pretty bearish on the PC market for a while. But clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected. I would say that from a demand perspective, the area of, if you want to call it, biggest surprise was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike can comment a little bit on what we're seeing there, after I kind of give a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then, there were some other areas that were maybe kind of slightly better than what we expected where, in aggregate, it came out to kind of 100 million unit TAM number. Now, from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go forward estimates as it relates to our financials. On the negative side is that we saw steeper than anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and, even more specifically, in capacity enterprise. And to be even more specific on that, in the 4 terabyte, 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins where they were short of our expectations, and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And oh, by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more steeper declines from a pricing perspective. Now, what we're doing as a consequence of that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint, because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selective price increases in certain enterprise markets. And at this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do. And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. Hi, Rich. So I think it's important to start delineating the performance enterprise marketplace. And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is a decline in 15,000 RPM that continues – that trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10,000 RPM market quarter-over-quarter. But the pronounced reduction we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all-flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trends, downward trends within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment and we'll be, as Steve said, looking at the way that portfolio shapes up and positioning ourselves appropriately.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, Olivier, I know it's early, but in light of recent actions by the Treasury Department on, initially I guess tax inversions, but it could potentially have broader impacts on broad cross-border transfers and other things. Do you see any impact at this point on the way you wanted to normalize the tax rate between the two companies over time?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Rich, obviously this recent action is a draft which is currently being open for comments. And while it's premature for us to provide more details at this stage, we feel comfortable with the structure of our transactions. So no change at this stage, Rich.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. A couple questions also, if I can. First of all, as we look at the capacity shipment growth for the industry, it's continued to be relatively slow. I was curious if you could help us understand or delineate between what you've seen capacity shipment growth-wise in the PC market as well as CE. And then, relative to the overall enterprise market. And then in the context of the pricing environment, I'm curious of how you would frame the discussion around the gross margin differential between those segments.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. Let me touch on that capacity growth. So we continue to see, again, looking on an annualized basis, considering the calendar year, capacity enterprise continues to trend at this 35% run rate. Last year looks like, and the data is preliminary, that it came in around 34%. We would expect this year also to be tracking to that number, maybe slightly greater. We'll see how the year pans out. Now, the one thing I should point out, we discussed this last time, is carrier 2015 was inverted relative to seasonality, stronger in the first half, weaker in the second half. This year is more traditional seasonality where we expect strength in the back end of the year. And that's further supported by what a number of the hyperscale companies have talked about relative to expected CapEx. So that growth remains as expected. The softness in capacity shipments really is across the other markets, led by the PC market as well as this new news that we discussed today on performance enterprise.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Any comments on the relative margin differential between the segments?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Aaron, I'm not sure there's any new commentary. Obviously, the higher margin segments for us is in the enterprise area, capacity enterprise and performance. And then all still at attractive margins, the low end of that would be client-related activity as well as in gaming. And so there's really no change in terms of our margin hierarchy that we've talked about previously.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. If you could just start with for the June quarter, you guys I think are looking at the TAM or at least revenues decline by about 6%. Is that entirely going to come from units or is there a pricing dynamic as well? And any segment information you could provide in terms of what's getting incrementally softer in June would be helpful.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so we would say that TAM, to be more specific, would be about 95 million units for the June quarter. And the primary reason for that is continued weakness in terms of the PC market. And not only that, but, frankly, from our standpoint and as well as our customers, a very cautious view with regards to that market. Not a lot of bullish views out there on the PC market. As well as continued softness in terms of the performance enterprise. Those are the only ones that I think are really kind of worthy of calling out. We've got some other puts and takes in terms of normal seasonal trends that we see from a Q1 to Q2. But the primary reason for that decline is really those two factors that I called out. The other thing that I would add to that is that if you go back to our prior conference call, we had anticipated that the March quarter would be the low point of the year from a TAM perspective. Obviously, that has not borne itself out assuming that the TAM turns out to be 95 million units. And the primary reason for that is, again, because of weaker PC sales and softer demand for traditional performance enterprise hard drives.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. And if I just follow-up on the enterprise SSD side, revenues were down I think 11% versus year-over-year. And you guys talked about it being down last quarter somewhat, but it seems a little bit more severe than I would have thought and what some of your peers have been talking about. So I'm just wondering if you could just talk about what's happening within that segment and how do you see that transpire for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I think we had talked about a product transition underway. Certainly, we are seeing increased competitiveness there. But for us, we're in the midst of a product transition, which we will get through as we progress through the year. So that largely accounts for the difference you're talking about.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and by the way, just to give you some insight to that. We had obviously expected and we messaged and telegraphed a decrease in terms of that revenue. And the decrease was more or less consistent with what we expected. And not only that, we we did a little bit better than we thought. So it's not concerning for us. It's something that we expected. And it just has to do with the normal product transition that we're working through on our end with our customers.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Right. And I'll add a little more color. I think relative to strategic engagements, they remain very well intact. And we think we'll get through this in the normal course of things. So no ongoing impact that we expect once we get through the transition.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes, Steve, it seems like the characterization of your customer and trend and their buying behavior is changing. The traditional enterprises haven't been as active over the past few years and that has been replaced by the cloud guys, and the cloud guys are pushing for more of a array procurement. In that context, do you see the change in your customer characterization having an impact on how you define different segments of the market?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead, Mike.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So I think we absolutely see a transition between our customers, but that's really reflected mostly by moving from platform to traditional client server markets to cloud-based architectures as we talked about in our prepared remarks. So that architectural shift is happening, and with that, the ratio of business is trending towards more of the cloud-based architectures when we talk about enterprise. So as we look at the customers, certainly, is that the relative revenue is changing the way we look at them, engage them is also changing and that's all contemplated within our business and our modeling going forward. So yes, to your question, both from a customer transition as well as a – which architectures are we shipping into and how workloads are migrating.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Which makes it lumpier. And a follow-up has to do with the NAND. Have you already started the product qualification as you go through the integration of SanDisk? And how should we think about the timing associated, because as you go through the qualification for your own – for the existing SSD products, as well as consolidating enterprise SSDs once SanDisk is integrated, I imagine there would be a time or a lagging effect how you get your arms around it. Is that going to – do we need to wait till July conference call to get more clarification or how should we think about this timing? Any color you can provide will be appreciated.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, a few comments there. I mean the first thing is, no, we have not begun any qualification or integration-related activities for our products. And I think it's important to note that, obviously, we continue to operate as two separate companies. And so that would be inappropriate for us to be engaging in that kind of activity at this point. Now, relative to the timing, let me make a few comments on that. From a financial perspective, when we talked about the financial synergies that we expected to realize, there was some timing that was wrapped around that. There is no change in terms of the expectation as it relates to that timing. So that remains consistent. Obviously, we'll update the investment community as we move forward on how that timing may change, et cetera. But there are multiple considerations that we have to think about. Obviously, the most important thing is that we want to execute the transition in a way that makes the most sense for our partners. And so, that's our customers, as well as our relationship with Intel. We've enjoyed a very strong relationship with Intel over a period of time. And we want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that makes the most sense for all the parties involved. So that will take some time, and we do believe that when we talked about the financial synergies that we would realize that we factored in appropriately those time considerations in our thinking.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. I know the acquisition is not closed yet, the SanDisk acquisition, but how are you viewing the relative progress of the 3D NAND roadmap at SanDisk, especially in the context of other industry investments? And what timeframe do you expect the SanDisk acquisition to be accretive given the moving pieces? And I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so I'm going to speak to it in general, because we don't have perfect visibility into that, but we continued to be encouraged. I mean, obviously, we did extensive due diligence just to kind of back up on where we believe that SanDisk was at from a 3D NAND transition perspective. And we have monitored their progress, as time has gone on, and as you saw in their earnings release, they continue to make good progress. So we're actually very pleased with where they are at on their 3D NAND transition. We're not in a position to be updating our financial view on the transaction. I mean the numbers that we put out there remain intact. And obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. There are a lot of variables that can change, but in general, we continue to believe that the financial assumptions that we have looked at remain solid as it relates to the acquisition of SanDisk.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the potential to raise prices more broadly across the portfolio? And what impact on the flip side do you think that raising prices could have on the rate of SSD adoption? Did you see some of that already?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean the ability to raise prices, that's always a difficult question to answer. I mean what we're trying to do is we're trying to provide value to our customers. And there's a lot of different ways you can provide value to the customers. And we have to have price competitive products, but we also need to make sure that we've got sufficient returns on those products that we're selling that allows us to reinvest in our technology and our products such that those products continue to remain compelling. And so, as we indicated, we have taken some efforts and seen price increases stick in the 2.5-inch market. We saw steeper declines in the enterprise market. We chose not to participate in some of those areas. We're now in the process of instituting some selective price increases in the enterprise market. And it's too early to tell at this point to what extent they're going to stick. And so, we'll have to see, because there are other market participants and we're just trying to run on our own plays and see how it all works out.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to build off of the last question in terms of just trying to understand what have been your assumptions around the kind of the vector, if you will, in terms of HDD versus SSD penetration in terms of how much of PCs, server and storage capacity currently is served by HDD versus SSD, and where does that kind of trend over the next two years, three years, that give you confidence to be, one, pursuing SanDisk, but also, two, to becoming this agnostic media provider.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, I'll have Mike take a stab at that.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: You need to think about it differently for each segment. In the case of PC, it's a unit replacement. So you think about a PC, it has – most often, it has a single storage device, and there's going to be a selection made between a HDD or an SSD. So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time. In the SSD versus PC outlook, we're in the mid-30%s in terms of penetration. That's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe the trend will continue. Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload and it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per I/O basis. Flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise. It's primarily in two spots. One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage systems area. And that's where you can get a more efficient cost per I/O across total infrastructure, system infrastructure. So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric. It's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus. It's not a one-for-one replacement either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area. Moving into servers. It follows something closer to the PC model, where you have low-end and mid-range servers that tend to have a number of storage devices and it tends to be price-point related. So you match the CPU, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going and, frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see the impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and I think, Mark, just to add to that, it's a little bit of a financial overlay to it. The trends that we're seeing are consistent with our expectations. And I think that's an important thing. But as you know, sometimes the difficult thing is not so much to predict what the trend is going to be, but the rate and pace. And so the rate and pace is kind of difficult to estimate. But what's important relative to what we're doing and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as with the acquisition of SanDisk, is that you have the optionality or the ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issues that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to in legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker. And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate not only those trends, but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to deal with those changes.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, and one last comment just to append what Steve said. So although the pieces underneath are moving around on us, as we've described, the aggregate spend in enterprise on storage when you combine SSD and HDD continues to grow at a rate that's consistent with our expectation.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. It sounds like it's a pretty frenetic environment, but it sounds like at this point you will be in a position to optimize the combined company and not have to be playing catch-up relative to some of these dynamics. I guess I have just one follow-up though, if I could. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the cloud providers versus the on-premise? Are they acting a little differently with respect to flash versus disk?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. So, the cloud guys have been on a capacity enterprise plus flash model for some time. They have not been a big consumer of performance enterprise. That really goes to our legacy systems businesses. So that trend continues within the cloud world.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies.
James Kisner - Jefferies LLC: I just want to clarify your comments on MOFCOM. So there was a news source that was reporting that the NDRC is getting involved and that in the MOFCOM approval process, seen some complaints from suppliers around this deal. And just wondering if you can comment whether there have been complaints and has that slowed the approval process at all and when do you think you might get approval?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so just as I said, we have a very strong relationship with MOFCOM. We have a very constructive dialogue with them. I'm not going to comment and chase rumors around, but I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making and we expect to close the transaction here in the second quarter. So no issues from that perspective.
James Kisner - Jefferies LLC: Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up. This quarter, I think you spent less on CapEx in absolute terms than you have in a very long time. And just wondering how we should think about the capital intensity of Western Digital's business sort of ex-SanDisk going forward over the next few quarters as well as the next couple of years. Thanks.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Obviously, as we are rationalizing the footprint of our organization that will have an impact on CapEx, obviously, we're looking at maximizing the use of cash. To answer specifically to your question, 4% of revenue going forward is probably – CapEx is probably a good number to use.
James Kisner - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just two, if I could. The first one, Steve, is just to sort of follow on your comments about rate and pace. How do you guys philosophically think about the interplay in the enterprise between what's going on with flash and then the traditional enterprise portfolio? And I know you can't comment sort of probably specifically about the SanDisk product, but just from what attracted you in that regard to their portfolio, just a bigger picture, do you – if you see the shift may be taking place a little bit more quickly, the enterprise to flash from – sort of from performance HDD. Do you think that there can be a relatively, I guess, smooth transition from a revenue dollar perspective relative to the WD P&L? It seems like it was a – I think you're implying is a little bit more disruptive this quarter than you thought it might have been. So we'd love to get your thoughts on at least the high or low, how we might think about that interplay as we go forward. And then I had just one quick follow-up. Thanks.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, let me try to answer that. So I think relative to a post- acquisition close situation, we will be able to participate in all segments of the enterprise SSD marketplace. So once we've accomplished that, the comment I made earlier relative to the growth within enterprise devices, SSD plus HDD being largely as expected, is really the movement within. So we really need the broad portfolio to do that. We are obviously excited to get to the point where we have in that. So we think we have the diverse tools we need to manage that transition.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And we were – by the way, I mean we were very pleased with the enterprise SSD numbers that SanDisk posted yesterday. So that's encouraging as well.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: That's very helpful context. And then, just quickly, Steve, what are your TAM views for the remainder of the year given that kind of June Q feels a little bit softer than you thought it would be 90 days ago. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, in that, it's difficult to predict at this point to be honest, because it is – we got a weak macroeconomic environment. So I don't need to go through all of the reasons why demand is a little bit more suppressed than what we'd hoped. But what we expect to see is a normal seasonal bump in terms of demand in Q3 and Q4. The question is how much. And frankly, I'm going to have to kind of skirt that question, because I think that it's still a little bit too far out to be able to predict that, but we would expect to see some sort of seasonal increase in demand in calendar Q3 and Q4. To where we should have a TAM? This is not going to really help you, but we clearly should have a TAM that will be in excess of 400 million units, right?
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.
John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. A real quick question on the gross margin. I mean, I know we've been looking at this a long time. Do you think you're running at a new normal? I know you guided to the top half of your range, but what gives you confidence that the gross margin won't stay down in the lower half given what we see in the last few quarters?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's two factors to consider. One is that we have these cost savings that will be realizing as a consequence of the WD HGST integration, which will obviously assist us in improving our gross margins. The other thing is, which Mike talked about is, over the last really three quarters, ourselves and as an industry have been dealing with a bit of a suppressed demand environment in the capacity enterprise market. And so, as that works its way back up to a more normalized demand environment, say, starting in the second half of this year which is back on that 35% kind of exabyte consumption model, that will aid us from a gross margin perspective. And then, additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we have taken some actions to selectively increase our prices which we also believe, assuming that they stick, will provide a benefit to our gross margins.
John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC: Could you characterize the Hitachi stuff, what's going to – what do you feel like – is that most of it or is that half of it or a third? I don't know.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would prefer not to try to dimension it that way. I think you're just going to have to do your own modeling to try to estimate that.
John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. The pressure on performance enterprise seems real versus AFA as discussed on the call. Are we getting close to a point where, in your enterprise segment, you're shipping more capacity enterprise than performance enterprise?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think that we have talked about that, Jayson. So you're going to have to – I feel like a broken record. You're going to have to do your best to try to guesstimate that on your own.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough. Just a follow-up on visibility into capacity enterprise. Your language is the same or similar, at least, to last quarter on strength in the second half. Has visibility improved from that segment over the last few months? And is it – it's more of a second half of the calendar year than it is a June quarter event?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So I think we talked earlier that it was going to be a stronger second half of the calendar year last time. I would say our resolution continues to tighten as we get closer, so we have basically confirmation of what we thought last time. So that's been largely echoed in what we hear relative to CapEx plans from some large consumers of these units.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jayson. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress on all fronts. Have a good rest of the day. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal: Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management's current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which Western Digital is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results, performance or game plan or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. This conference call does not constitute an offer to purchase, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in connection with the pending merger with SanDisk. Western Digital filed a Form-S4 Registration Statement with the SEC that includes proxy statements of SanDisk and Western Digital and a prospectus of Western Digital regarding the merger. After the joint proxy statement prospectus is declared effective, Western Digital and SanDisk will mail the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus to their respective stockholders. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statements and prospectus carefully when it becomes available, because it contains important information about the merger. In addition, Western Digital, SanDisk, and their respective directors, executive officers, and certain other members of management and employees may be soliciting proxies from their respective shareholders in favor of the proposed transaction. You can find the information about Western Digital directors and executive officers in Western Digital's most recent proxy statement, and about SanDisk's directors and executive officers in SanDisk's most recent proxy statement. You may obtain a copy of these documents through the SEC's website or the Western Digital and SanDisk websites. Further references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Quarterly Fact Sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. I also want to highlight that the information provided during this call today regarding the savings realized as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries and the expected costs to achieve such savings are included in the Quarterly Fact Sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question today. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section sometime later after this call. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, Chief Executive Officer.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM had placed on our business. We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million, and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected. We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long-term. We're taking a number of important steps in this context. We're reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products, and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail in the magnitude and timing of the integration related savings, but let me cite a few examples. Last week, we announced the closure of our head wafer manufacturing facility in Otawara, Japan, one of our three head wafer facilities. We are streamlining our product roadmap by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of six programs. And we recently set our new leadership team with a plan to complete our new company-wide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry. Turning to the longer term, we remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing, and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the innovated growth and the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored, and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We continue to diversify our revenue base into higher growth areas aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in capacity enterprise, most recently with our leadership in Helium seal drives. Our Helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10 terabyte drive, our third generation Helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of Helium technology and enterprise IT, as it marks a shift for hard drive makers to deliver value-added storage solutions to customers, based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership. Our enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending, and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive Systems business, with several wins in tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications, and other vertical markets. Regarding the SanDisk acquisition, we are pleased with the progress we're making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible. And as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have completed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro-competitive. We've also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter. I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across non-volatile memory and rotating magnetic media, and an expanded addressable market. On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with CFIUS, as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. CFIUS has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given CFIUS's heavy case load towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and re-file our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. CFIUS agreed to our request and we re-filed in January. We now expect a decision from CFIUS sometime in February. Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV. I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees. Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.3 billion. We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5%, and operating expenses totaled $542 million. Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million, or 5% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million, or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million, or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S. I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. Finally, we indicated the savings will be attained over a one-year to two years period. There are three main components in realizing these savings, including asset and footprint reduction, product roadmap consolidation and organization rationalization. During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million, from which these cost savings should be calculated. Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017. For cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017. This would give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016, and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash costs to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction efforts. Finally, we expect about 75% of these costs to be incurred in 2016, and the balance in 2017. Moving onto our guidance for the March quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter, operating expenses of approximately $500 million. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, before we get to questions, I just wanted to correct, I had a misreading of my script. The strategic joint venture with Unisplendour will sell our storage systems in China. I believe I misread that as Japan. So I just want to clarify that. We'll take people's questions now. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question here comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line's now open.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you, and appreciate the detail, Steve and Olivier, on the cost-cutting. I wanted to ask, on the timing, 50% in 2016 and 50% in 2017, how does that roll out through the year, Olivier?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It will be equally stepping up. I think it's fair to expect that by the end of calendar year 2016. OpEx should be around $520 million, and at the end of calendar year 2017, about $470 million.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then a follow-up on exabytes shipped. Some softness at the end of the year. Do you have much visibility? And what should we expect for the year from a seasonality perspective? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me take that question. So I think relative to exabytes shipped, particularly in capacity enterprise, we did see it come in a little bit beneath our estimate of 35% growth year-on-year, came in around 32%. We would expect we would normalize back towards 35% this year. We do have some visibility in terms of capital investments of our large customers. We'd expect the seasonality to move back towards something more typical where we would see something in the range of 55% to 60% in the second half of the calendar year, the balance in the first half.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. The line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I think everybody wants to hear what you have to say about – in case the Unis deal doesn't happen. In other words, if CFIUS approval is not obtained by the end of February, then the SanDisk acquisition requires the Western Digital shareholder approval and given the fact you seem comfortable that SanDisk is going to close in the June quarter, what gives you confidence that your shareholders are going to approve this?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So there's kind of several questions in there. Let me clarify a couple of things. The first thing is that the closing of the SanDisk acquisition is not contingent upon the closing of the Unis transaction. What will be affected, if for one reason or another, the Unis transaction were not to close, would be that incremental shares would be issued to the SanDisk shareholders in that sort of a scenario. Under either event, we will be seeking shareholder vote on the transaction and the only question is will the number of shares exceed 20% of our outstanding shares. And so there is a scenario where we would seek a shareholder vote, but it may not require the issuance of 20% of our shareholders. But either way, we will be conducting a proxy solicitation on behalf of our shareholders. Regarding our confidence level in terms of shareholder – our strong belief is and very strong belief and strong conviction is that this is the appropriate move for us to make for long-term shareholder value creation and we're confident in our ability to be able to get the necessary approvals from our shareholders to proceed with the transaction.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Your December quarter had enterprise SSD revenue of $270 million, up 44% year-over-year. How should we think about that trending into calendar year 2016?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So I think we noted in our comments there'll be some dynamics happening in the first part of the year where we'd expect a pause in that growth. And that's due to two factors. One is, would be typical IT spending being on a more cyclical basis or a seasonal basis. And we do see additional competition in that space, which we would expect to have a effect on our trajectory.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That being said, one of the things that we've said consistently is that we believe with our product portfolio and execution, we have the opportunity to continue to grow our enterprise SSD revenue at a multiple of the market growth, and we continue to believe that that will be the case moving forward.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Would you elaborate on the market growth?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I believe – what's the longer-term CAGR been estimated at?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We have been assuming about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, and that's a revenue statement.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Which segments are driving the below seasonal decline in the TAM in March? And then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So it's primarily PC and gaming being the biggest impact to that effect.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then you mentioned some visibility in the CapEx plans of large customers. I imagine you're commenting about cloud. Facebook gave aggressive guidance last night, so that makes sense. Would you expect WD's outside share of those large purchases among the cloud service providers to remain? And do you even think that you could grow your share of those purchases this year?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We think our value proposition to these customers with our product portfolio as well as the services we wrap around them allow us to maintain our share position over time. Obviously, we have continued to execute well as we move forward, as we ramp to 10 terabyte product, et cetera. But we don't see anything that would particularly affect our aggregate share. Over time, we do expect some normalizing of the capacity point share.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham & Company.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple questions. First, we get a lot of inbound questions about interest rates relative to the deal. Can you just talk a little bit about relative to your original expectations to fund the SanDisk transaction now and your ability to go and pay that debt level as the acquisition closes? And then, secondly, in terms of the overall TAM, Mike, would you believe that the TAM hits a trough here in the March quarter? Or do you think that there's potential further weakness in the June quarter? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Rich, this is Steve, let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is that we did – we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective as well as volatility as it relates to supply/demand dynamics in the NAND market. So we had stress cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bull case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction proved to be value-creating for our shareholders longer term. So we're very confident in that regard. Additionally, as we approached the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases today have been within our expectations and we're confident that that will remain the case. Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is – and there's additional detail to some degree in our S4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas of the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure. And so for those various reasons, I would emphasize that we continue to be very confident with regards to our ability to service the debt post close of the SanDisk transaction. So I'll ask Mike to comment on the TAM.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. Yeah, so to answer your question, Rich, I think we would see this as the low point of the year. I'll give you a little additional color on it. Of the sequential decline that we're projecting, we would chalk up roughly two-thirds of that to typical seasonality as well as the secular changes in the market, the balance of that attributed to macro conditions. And I think we would also say that given the environment around us, we're seeing a normal planning bias from the markets to be more conservative around build expectations as well as around inventory position, and all that's factored into our outlook.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The other thing, Rich, that I'd like to add to that is that we think that barring there being some other macroeconomic event that none of us can predict, that it appears that the calendar first quarter will be the low point from a TAM perspective as it relates to calendar 2016.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I want to go to the reported results. I think this quarter revenue was at the low end of your expectation, but gross margin, I think, you had initially guided to be up a little bit sequentially. So I'm curious of what the underlying drivers were to the relative shortfall in the gross margin line, and I do have a follow-up.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the relative shortfall in margin was due to two factors. One was product mix, which was the majority of the shortfall, and the balance was lower volume impacting our absorption cost.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, Aaron, the mix comment is really due to slightly lower enterprise volumes.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then sticking on the gross margin line as a follow-up, as you look at driving the synergy expectations that you expect of $250 million a year, and we look out to calendar 2017, relative to the mix change happening in the overall hard disk drive industry, should we not be thinking that the gross margin line is at the high end of the 27% to 32%? And if not, why not?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm not so sure I would go to that point at this stage, and there's a lot of moving parts in terms of what happens with gross margin. The one thing that – the biggest drag in terms of near-term on our gross margins, if you want to call it that, I mean, let's be honest, we still continue to have strong gross margin performance, but it's been weaker enterprise volumes. And it really has to do with what Mike was talking about in that the first half of calendar year 2015 had a higher mix of enterprise volumes and then there was an absorption of that – those drives in the back half. We will see that kind of flip and go to normal seasonality in calendar year 2016. So all things remaining equal, we should see our margins begin to benefit from that higher gross margin level as we exit calendar year 2016. But, of course, there can be other factors including pricing which can impact things, there can be total volumes. And so I don't know if I want to be specific at this point as to when we'll end up closer to that high end of that range. But we're certainly going to do everything in our power to make it happen from an execution and from a product perspective.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions as well. One, appreciate all the color on the MOFCOM centric savings that you guys are providing. I'm curious, how do you think about cash conversion cycle and CapEx numbers trending, given the fact that you're able to integrate these assets? And what's the right way to think of those factors?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So on the cash conversion cycle, we expect the impact to be minimum. We are going to have some impact on inventory, for example, but we wouldn't factor a (31:37) major improvement. In CapEx, being at the low end of our range, even in the range of 4% is not a bad assumption.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. And then, I guess, if I just follow up on some of the discussions before, Steve, what's the comfort level you have today to the best you can talk about that the Unis investment comes in the way it was initially structured and doesn't really change? And I want to clarify, you guys are going to seek a shareholder vote on the SanDisk transaction even if you don't need it, i.e., even if you don't have to issue 20% equity, right?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's correct. We will be seeking shareholder vote in any scenario. Yes, you're correct. Regarding our confidence level in terms of CFIUS ruling this to be a non-covered transaction, let me make a couple of comments on that. First thing is, which we've said repeatedly, is that we were very careful with regards to how we structured the transaction. And based upon that, we do not believe it's a covered transaction. Now, that being said, this is up to the CFIUS committee and the U.S. government to decide. And, frankly, that's very difficult at this stage to handicap. So I'm not sure that I want to go there in terms of trying to predict that. We want to certainly respect the decision-making process that the government goes through. We'll continue to engage with them and work with them. But clearly, we were very careful with how we structured the transaction.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. Thank you and best luck, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Olivier, could you maybe help us provide more financing detail for the debt you're planning to raise, especially given that SanDisk pays 31% – 32% tax rate, any tax savings synergies from tax if you could share with us? Thanks.
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So we believe and we have – we believe we can optimize the tax structure of SanDisk. We haven't provided much more details than that. And on the debt, if you want to look at the details of the debt, I will refer to our S4 filing, which has all the details of the debt, including the various instruments we'd be using, Monika.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: All right, thanks. Then, Steve, maybe could you talk about when do you plan to start using SanDisk NAND in your enterprise SSDs so you could see the margin benefit?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the short answer is as soon as we can, as soon as we possibly can, but obviously we've got to close the transaction and begin more formally the integration process, et cetera, et cetera so that – we don't have a specific time on that. But clearly, from a financial and from a product perspective, we're highly motivated to make that happen as quickly as we can from a product development and lifecycle perspective.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Sterne Agee CRT.
Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi. Thanks very much. On cost cutting, I'm curious if I could ask two questions if I'm allowed. One is just on the guide for the gross margin in the March quarter being up sequentially. Is that already because you're starting to actually get HGST COGS savings? In other words, would it have otherwise been probably down as would normally be the case?
Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So it would be a mix of both, better mix, slightly, but also starting to realize some of the synergies.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Small amount, Rob.
Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT: Yeah, okay. So actually there is some mix benefit there, I guess. And then second question I guess is just with – I appreciate that the $400 million in OpEx cuts you guys have been talking about all along, so that makes sense. But frankly, if you look at the TAM now, it's structurally lower than it was a year or so ago. So would it not actually be fair to think that something beyond the $400 million would actually make really more sense at this stage? Or is it just the fact you'd rather leave that as a separate – that's like a separate item, your HGST overlapping and you've got something else? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, Rob, it's an interesting question because you're right, the $400 million we've been talking about for frankly three-and-a-half years, four years, if my memory is correct. But one thing that I would comment on is that subsequent to that period, as individual entities, there have been a number of OpEx reduction efforts that have occurred since that time. And so the actual reduction in our operating expenses from the close of the HGST, WD transaction is actually much greater than an annual run rate of $400 million. For example, if you remember, the WD sub was engaged in the performance enterprise market. We have exited – on the WD side, that business was exited, the OpEx savings were saved there. And so net, kind of apples-to-apples, we've actually reduced our OpEx more than that original $400 million that we talked about three-and-a-half years ago.
Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal: Next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from Stan Kovler with Citi Research.
Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. I'm with Citi. As far as the cost savings goes, I was wondering if you could elaborate on cost savings beyond the HGST savings. At what point does the TAM get low enough where you would consider core capacity reductions to some degree? My first question. I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's a fair question. We constantly look at that, constantly look at that. And again, kind of going back to the comment that I made to Rob Cihra's question is that we have been – as the TAM has come down over the last few years, we have been continuing to rationalize our business to a lower volume base. So it's something that we dynamically and consistently evaluate and we'll continue to do so as we move forward.
Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And just on the transaction, if I could. What's your sense of the Unis investment going through, if in the case that CFIUS does deem it a covered transaction, could that still be something that they're interested in to go through that process and continue with their investment? And on the flipside, if they do wind up backing out for some reason or other considerations, is it possible to restructure the deal at this point to include more debt to lower the dilution in that second scenario of getting shareholder approval and buying SanDisk before the Unis transaction closes? Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Again, fair question. I'm not going to go there. At this point, our priority is working to satisfy the closing conditions as it relates to the Unis investment, including getting through the CFIUS process. To speculate at this point as to what happens if the U.S. government considers it to be a covered transaction, it's a little bit early to do that. So I'm not going to dare do that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall, JPMorgan.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is regarding visibility. I wonder if you could just remind us what the lead times look like right now for drives. And what gives you confidence that you have visibility beyond March, given the market seems so unpredictable at this stage? And then I've got a follow-up.
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: So relative to the visibility of demand, we have some improving insight, actually, as these businesses mature to plans for data center build outs and what's going to be required to do that, and what our proportion of that might be. So we continue to refine our engagement with those customers such that we get a more insightful view into it. Relative to our drive lead times, it depends on the type of drive that we're talking about. Anywhere from sort of four weeks to eight weeks would be a good planning number, larger capacity being a bit longer and that's due to test time.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And suffice it to say that given kind of the market volatility that we've seen, the anxiousness that's been out there, we are clearly taking a – as well as our customers are taking a very cautious view with regards to the demand outlook, particularly here in the near-term. We believe that's the prudent thing to do. But as always in terms of the way that we manage our business, if demand happens to be higher than what we would expect, we'll be there to meet that opportunity.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up was just – I don't know if you guys are able to estimate this, but do you have any idea where inventory levels stand on the consumer side right now, in weeks or some sort of a duration sort of an estimate? And I guess, on enterprise, the same question, although I suppose that's much harder to estimate.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we don't necessarily have any specific data on that other than to indicate we think that inventory levels are pretty healthy. And what I mean by healthy is relatively lean and in pretty good shape. In other words, we don't think that there is any, call it, excess inventory. We had seen that through calendar year 2015, particularly with some of the – in the PC market. We believe that that's worked its way through the system. And so in that regard – I mean, this is a positive statement. We don't believe that there's an inventory overhang that we or the broader industry need to deal with.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I guess I was thinking on the other side of it, it seems like inventory ought to be getting very lean out there. And I just wondered how stretched is the inventory level?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have a good sense for that. I mean, I don't think we have a call on that right now. So I hope you're right, I'll put it that way.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thanks. Steve, there's talk of Toshiba potentially exiting hard drives. Not to ask you to directly comment on the rumor mill, but instead if it did take place, curious on your view at what would happen to those assets from an industry point of view.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That I'm not going to speculate on. I mean, I don't really know. I don't know what Toshiba's plans are. I mean, that's obviously a question for them and what would they do, would they sell them? I don't know. That's not a question that I'm going to speculate on.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: All right, fair enough. Maybe as a quick follow-up, could you just clarify on the enterprise SSD commentary? Growth will pause, did you actually expect to decline year-over-year? That seems a little aggressive just based on a product transition. And along with that, when – do you expect to show that 25% to 30% growth for calendar 2016 still?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So I mean if you look at, we had $270 million of revenue last quarter. I believe a year ago we had about $230 million of revenue. So we've got a tough compare. Obviously, we're still in the midst of the quarter, but it's possible that we might see our year-on-year revenue down a bit, going into calendar Q1. And as far as the fiscal year, we would prefer not to be short-term focused in terms of that. But it's really, when we talk about exceeding industry growth rates, it's over a longer period of time. It's a little bit too early to say whether or not our growth this year will accelerate or decelerate versus that. So it's not really an indication one way or the other, but I'd prefer not to comment on that specifically.
Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Just looking at your enterprise sales from the first two quarters of this fiscal year, they're significantly below what they were a year ago. In fact, your sales this quarter I think were the lowest since first quarter of fiscal 2013. Just wondering, with the anticipated growth of the cloud, that's somewhat surprising to me. And how much of this is macro? And is there anything else going on with that number?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Mark, just to clarify, you must be looking at units, right?
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Yes.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So I think one of the things that we need to continue to focus on is the petabyte growth as opposed to the unit growth. Obviously, as we ship higher capacity points, we're going to ship, all things remaining equal, fewer units. So as Mike indicated, we continue to see strong petabyte growth. The number that we're estimating is 32% which is – well, longer term, 35%. This past year for us was 32%, which is pretty consistent with our expectation.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: And just final, if you could just explain, in terms of the conversion, whether Unis goes through, I think if Unis doesn't go through it's like 0.24 shares of Western Digital for each SanDisk share. Is the price set on that? Or would you have to give more shares because the price has come down?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The exchange ratio and the price has been fixed.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: And are you at liberty to say what the price – the fixed price is?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I believe it was $79.50.
Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question is on your prepared remarks, Steve, you mentioned a combination of both cyclical and secular factors were causing the weaker outlook. Can you talk more on some of the secular changes that you're seeing and to what extent any secular pressure from flash versus hard drive has accelerated? And in particular I'd be interested in any changes you're seeing in the enterprise segment.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So let me take client first. We see that continuing trend toward client SSDs, particularly in commercial class notebooks. It still remains within our planning guideline. So we don't see it accelerating beyond our expectation, but it is steadily increasing and it's certainly factored into that outlook. Relative to the enterprise, we do see, as evidenced by our own SAS enterprise SSD strategy, we do see the beginnings of the incursion of enterprise SSD into what is traditionally performance enterprise. And a way to think about that is it starts at the top first with 15,000 RPM drives as being the first area for that conversion to begin, and then later on it will be others. But we do see incursion in both those segments, all of which is happening within the rate of – that we have planned in our outlook. So that would be the color I can give you.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then a clarification question on some of the prior SanDisk comments. I know you said you used a range of planning assumptions, but clearly there's a lot of NAND market weakness and also interest rates and other factors. Is the comment that you made on the last – or on the SanDisk call about 10% accretion, is that still the right number for us to be thinking about, or has that changed?
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's still the correct number.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Just two if I could. One is – the first one is, one of the most frequent questions that we've gotten over the last few months with regards to the SanDisk deal is around Toshiba's ability, or I guess sort of Toshiba's positioning currently on 3D NAND IP development. So, Steve, was just wondering if you could remind us, in that regard, of the due diligence that you guys did in leading up to the announcement of the deal, and your comfort in that regard, with regards to 3D NAND. That would be awesome. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So just to remind everybody, as part of our due diligence, as it relates to the SanDisk acquisition is that we did extensive technical due diligence related to where SanDisk/Toshiba was with regards to the 3D NAND transition. That, we were very comfortable with where they were at and continue to be very comfortable with where they're at with their transition, and are particularly encouraged by the recent announcements that they made in conjunction with their earnings announcement, which indicates that they are now commercially shipping their 48 layer 3D NAND product into the marketplace.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Thanks. And then I guess my follow-up is, commensurate with your TAM comments with September – I'm sorry, March, being the calendar year low, could you share with us what your PC view is this year? And to what extent, if any, we may be able to see some enterprise refresh or commercial refresh as we get to the second half of this year? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So relative to – I'll let Mike address the enterprise refresh. But in terms of PCs, we have not been bullish on the PC market for a while. And we would see, generally speaking, the rate of decline in the PC market to be a bit less than what it's been this past calendar year. And maybe something in 6%, 5%, something like that kind of range on a full-year basis. But as I indicated, we continue to be not particularly optimistic from an overall perspective regarding what's happening in the PC market, and our financial plans and future plans are not highly contingent on that. Mike? Enterprise outlook?
Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So I think on an enterprise outlook basis, I sort of referenced it, on the capacity enterprise segment, we see that continuing to progress. We see an increasing adoption of Helium flash drives as the people deploying infrastructure realize the benefits of the TCO that that technology offers. We articulated that growth rate we would expect across that total segment. Relative to the performance category, I just talked a little bit about that. We do see the continuing penetration of flash-based products into that marketplace. We see that continuing through the balance of the year, as evidenced by a number of people in their systems announcements most recently. We would expect that to benefit from that obviously with our strategy of being media agnostic as we move forward with the completion of the SanDisk acquisition.
Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC: Thanks a lot. Very helpful.
Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for joining us today. In summary, we continue to execute well in a challenging environment and we're taking proactive steps to maintain and extend our cost leadership in the HDD industry. We're also pleased with our progress on our strategic efforts to diversify and strengthen the company for the long term, including the acquisition of SanDisk. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress on all fronts. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2015-10-29 20:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital’s Financial Results for the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you, you may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the meaning of the federal securities law. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management’s current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors many of which Western Digital is unable to predict or control that may cause Western Digital’s actual results, performance or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The call does not constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in connection with the pending merger with SanDisk. Western Digital will file a Form S-4 registration statement that includes proxy statement of SanDisk and Western Digital and a prospectus of Western Digital regarding the merger. Western Digital and SanDisk will email the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus to their respective stockholders. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement prospectus carefully when it becomes available because it contains important information about the merger. In addition, Western Digital, SanDisk and the respective Directors, Executive Officers and certain other members of management and employees may be soliciting proxies from their respective stockholders in favor of the proposed transaction. You can find information about Western Digital directors and executive officers in Western Digital’s most recent proxy statement and about SanDisk directors and executive officers in SanDisk’s most recent proxy statement. You may also obtain a copy of these documents through the SECs website or the Western Digital and SanDisk’s websites. Further references will be made during this call for non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call for the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The non-GAAP forward-looking guidance we provide during this call includes amortization of intangibles, integration and acquisition relating costs. Because we currently cannot fully quantify future amounts for these excluded items, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these exclusive items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question today. I also want to note that copies and remarks from today’s call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital’s website following the conclusion of this call. And with that I turn the call over to Western Digital’s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Steve Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter. This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment in our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM, and planned acquisition of SanDisk, coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I am very excited about the company’s future and our ability to create long term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We are proceeding with our integration in to a single company, as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition, and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Turning to the September quarter, industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5 inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.9%, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution. Our enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SaaS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally we continue to ramp our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drivers also continued its rapid growth, as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose or purpose build solutions. We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8 terabyte helium drive and will be ramping our 10 terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. Overall, demand in the high capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers. Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the capacity enterprise sector will continue with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth and data bank created and stored. Looking to the PC market, we are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. Longer term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company in to a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base, and an expanded addressable market. Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook.
Olivier Leonetti: Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.4 billion. We shipped a total of 51.7 million hard disk drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.9% and operating expenses totaled $567 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $31 million or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $366 million or $1.56 per share. In the September quarter, we generated $545 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $394 million. Our CapEx totaled $151 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 700,000 shares for $60 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion of which approximately $600 million was held in the US. I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be slightly up from the September quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $585 million, and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session of today’s call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani: I have a question and a follow-up, just to start with, could you just talk about the benefit the MOFCOM approval have on your cash and rationability as you forward, and how do you think the timing of those benefits of flow and would be in sync with your P&L, and does MOFCOM help you get within the target of your cash conversion cycle of four to eight days.
Steve Milligan: I’ll take that and then Olivier can add a little bit of a color, and this is Steve. If you look at benefits that we expect from the revised MOFCOM ruling is that, first thing is that we expect to realize $400 million of annual operating expense savings and then we’ve also commented that we’ll have material cost synergies. We have not quantified what material means in terms of cost synergies. Generally speaking, the 400 million of operating expense savings would be roughly equivalent to cash savings as our OpEx. The cost savings that we would realize, which have not been quantified would be a mixture of cash and depreciation, that sort of thing. So it’d be kind of a mixture.
Olivier Leonetti: Yeah let me add two comments; first of all most of the cash will be generated offshore. We commented on that 90% of the benefit would be generated outside US. And from a cash conversion cycle we believe we’re going to have some improvements but I wouldn’t bank on many days.
Steve Milligan: I can comment on that because there’s a little bit of perspective, the four to eight days we announced that I think it was back in September of 2002 or ’03. It will help, sorry at this track of time, but you know shortly after the acquisition the composition of our business has changed dramatically since then particularly a lower percentage from a PC business which tended to have a higher cash conversion to more of an enterprise mix which has a slower cash conversion. So we’re going to need to reset at some point what that cash conversion cycle from a business perspective should be for our company.
Amit Daryanani: Got it, that’s really helpful. Just as a follow-up could you talk about gross margin dynamic in the September quarter was up 60 basis points so you planned, mix looks like may be a part of it, but was there anything else especially from a pricing perspective that sort of impeded your gross margins.
Olivier Leonetti: All of it was actually mix, higher mix of gaming and higher mix of notebook and branded products.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: One question and one follow-up as well. Olivier, I think you had made a comment that your operating expense in the current quarter is expected to be 585. I just want to clarify that, and if that’s true, just curious on what’s the upper driver here in this current quarter, and again kind of going back to Amit’s question, when can we start to actually see that OpEx come down as it relates to that MOFCOM. Is that over the next two or three quarters or is it further out? I think last week you had suggested that you should be through a lot of that by the time you get to that SanDisk closure.
Olivier Leonetti: So different guidance for OpEx is a bit higher than our run rate due to incentive compensation. Following the December quarter, we would expect run rate OpEx to be in the range of 575 give or take before.
Steve Milligan: 570.
Olivier Leonetti: 575 give or take before MOFCOM synergies. Now in terms of MOFCOM synergies as indicated we will expect them to materialize between the next 12 and 24 months and would provide you an update on regular basis.
Steve Milligan: The run rate OpEx free MOFCOM synergies is 570 million.
Aaron Rakers: But just to be fair, you are looking to drive that OpEx down and that’s not going to happen. Should some of that start to happen before we even get to the 12 months, is what I am asking.
Steve Milligan: The short answer is yes Aaron. What we haven’t done which - let’s keep in mind that prior to the revised ruling from MOFCOM we were precluded from doing any integration planning, and so we have begun detailed integration planning and all of that, and so we are not prepared at this point to indicate specifically a phasing or the timing of those OpEx synergies other than to indicate they’ll take place over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. But clearly we’re going to be looking at how we can bring those in as much as possible from a financial perspective while minimizing impact to our business. Okay.
Aaron Rakers: And then as a follow-up I’m just curious on the capacity shipment trends. You talked a little bit about, it looks like you were down about 2% year-over-year in terms of total capacity shipped. Can you help us bridge what that capacity ship looks like between the PC business relative to your enterprise business and what’s that [stranded] like.
Steve Milligan: I am not sure I follow that question Aaron.
Aaron Rakers: I guess relative to the 35% compound annual growth rate that you reference on the enterprise side going forward, just curious of how that growth looks like over the past few quarters within the total capacity ship number that you report.
Steve Milligan: I got it. So Mike’s going to take that question.
Mike Cordano: Hi Aaron, so I think the way to think about it, we still think the calendar year is tracking to the 35% number may be slightly higher. We saw a little bit of front loading in the calendar year of that, and so that’s being absorbed in the comments that Steve made earlier as we get in to the second half. So I think that trend we’re confident in that, and that’s specifically around the capacity enterprise segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is now open.
Rich Kugele: A couple of questions, first on the capacity enterprise side, obviously that spans more than cloud service providers. Can you just talk about to the capacity enterprise cloud service provider part of your exabyte shipments, and how you would expect to trend over the next 6 to 12 month as you move especially to 10 terabyte?
Steve Milligan: So Rich I’ll take that question. As you know, we try to stay away from talking about specific either customers or types of customers. Obviously cloud service providers are a meaningful part of exabytes shipped on our part. But the absorption that I eluded to in my prepared remarks was a mixture of both traditional enterprise customers, if you want to call it that, as well as cloud service providers.
Rich Kugele: Okay, interesting. And then post SanDisk now, is there anything that you were contemplating on the Hitachi integration that now needs to be altered because of the SanDisk integration. Are there like facilities that perhaps now you need to keep or does it change, what could have happened in any way.
Steve Milligan: Well I think the first thing to keep in mind Rich is that, given the complimentary nature of the SanDisk and Western Digital transaction, it’s a different kind of an integration in that regard. That’s an important thing to contemplate. Simplistically, the answer to your question is, no it doesn’t really alter anything. There are some additional things that we’ll have to think about that add a bit more complexity, for example, systems integrations and things like that. So we’ll have to look at not only the pre-existing WD and HGST systems, but also what platform is SanDisk on and how do we kind of manage that process. But other than a few items like that, we intend to more or less perceive full steam in terms of the integration on the WD/HGST side.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan: Steve on your comments about absorption on the capacity side, can you help us think through either how much do you think incremental demand half core, half migrated in to the first half versus second half for the calendar year because of those purchases or alternatively how much of the absorption do you think we are through and what innings are we in in that, and I have a follow-up.
Steve Milligan: Well let me comment on it this way, one of the things that we talked about in our last earnings call and also I believe our largest competitor also commented on it is typically the, I’ll call it the mix exabytes that gets shipped. You have about 40% that typically gets shipped in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. And if you look back, and that’s calendar year, right, not our fiscal year. And that percentages held kind of pretty consistent over a number of years. This year roughly speaking, we are looking at something that’s more like 45 and 55. So that will help kind of dimension a bit. And we would expect that that absorption of capacity or exabyte shipped, that absorption will continue through the balance of this calendar year, and begin to, if you want to call it abate as we begin next calendar year.
Wamsi Mohan: And then on the Nearline side, clearly you took some share over there. As you had some customers migrate to the 8 terabyte drivers, can you talk about what happened with the pricing on a like-for-like basis for the 4 and 6 terabyte and did that influence margins, thanks.
Steve Milligan: Well the short answer is that, that’s not something that we call that as a particular driver of our margin performance. I mean Olivier commented on the decline that we saw on our gross margin was driven entirely by mix, and that being a stronger mix of lower margin products namely drives the gaming console as well as 2.5 drives that go in notebooks, consistently have been below the corporate average. That’s what impacted our margin, and whether or not other thing impacted, we are not calling anything else specifically.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Rod Hall: I just wanted to ask about the regional trends particularly Europe but may be also the US. The European year-over-year growth deteriorating quite a bit in the quarter to minus 15% from minus 8 last quarter; so I wondered if you guys could give us a little color on what’s going on there, is that just consumer demand deteriorating or there are other things happening. And then same for the North American region, down 6% after being up 16.5. Is that just datacenter or cloud oriented stuff or can you give us a little bit of color on those regional trends. Thanks.
Steve Milligan: I don’t know if there’s anything particularly to call out other than Europe has been weak from call it a broader macroeconomic perspective. It’s always difficult to draw conclusions from our geographic data because so much of our product is manufactured in Asia or is passed on to customers that manufacture in Asia, so it doesn’t really speak to the end market, but we have seen some as you know and the macroeconomic situation in Europe has kind of impacted some of our more retail oriented business, but I am not sure I would call out anything specific beyond that.
Rod Hall: And the European drives I guess are more Europe linked is that correct? Whereas elsewhere you get more especially in Asia it leaks out in to other regions or is that the wrong way to see things.
Steve Milligan: Well probably in Europe you’re right, because there isn’t a lot of manufacturing done in Europe, right. North American you get a little bit of a mix because there are some manufacturing our systems that may go elsewhere and certainly in Asia. But Europe’s a little bit more of a true number. But Europe’s been from a broader perspective weak for a while.
Mike Cordano: Yeah, you’re not the only ones.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fox: Can you hear me okay?
Steve Milligan: Sure.
Steven Fox: But not that great. Just one question just switching gears, could you talk about your solid-state drive business a little bit? I think you mentioned a little bit of capacity issues or rather competitive issues are increasing during the quarter and then relative to average capacities and some of the trends you mention in the enterprise, how do those relate to what’s going on in SSDs, utility and to the rest of the calendar year. And that’s all I had, thanks.
Steve Milligan: We’ve enjoyed through strong product execution etcetera a pretty strong market position in an enterprise SSD business. It’s a very competitive market as I eluded to in my comments and quite simply, not for anyone particular issue or another other than just increased competition and we gave back a little bit of our share on in this past quarter.
Steven Fox: And just in terms of average capacities or how the business trends through the rest of the year?
Steve Milligan: Overall or enterprise SSD, specifically.
Steven Fox: Just enterprise SSDs.
Steve Milligan: That’s nothing surprising we continue to see as product generation gets announced, we continue to see an upward trend in average capacity shipment.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jeffries. Your line is open.
James Kisner: So my question is just regarding seasonality, I believe on the June quarter call you guys talked about seasonality being abnormal because of just the depressed nature of client demand primarily. But just wanted to get update your thoughts, I’d like you to comment ideally sort of effects MOFCOM just the seasonality of earnings in this fiscal after having a couple more quarters or at least another quarter under your belt.
Steve Milligan: I don’t know if I call it. If you look at seasonality, if you look at the client’s business, client plus gaming which really drove most of the increase in TAM from calendar Q2 to calendar Q3, the seasonal uptick in that regard was pretty consistent with what we normally see. It’s normally up anywhere from 6%, 7%, 8%, something in that kind of range, and that’s kind of what we saw in those segments of the market. The other things that’s happened is that, while we used to see further increase in volumes in calendar Q4, that’s kind of dissipated or gone away as our customers generally build earlier in the year and then they will put those on boats or longer transport kind of things to save transportation cost. So the seasonality from calendar Q3 to Q4 which has been going on for a while is much more muted, hence our view of a flattish TAM going in to calendar Q4.
James Kisner: I guess sort of still wondering here, you are obviously massively under shipping and market demand, and I think units are down 30% on the client side. I am just wondering if there is hope at all here to see more recovery to closer to end market demand.
Steve Milligan: Well we’ll have to see. We’ve said this before, although we’ve seen some signs of stabilization in the PC market, I would not necessarily characterize us as being particularly bullish on that segment. And we have seen, there was inventory draw down through the whole kind of supply chain that’s impacted our business a little bit in terms of where we may be at a sync a bit in terms of what you’re seeing from an overall PC unit perspective. And then additionally, we continue to see penetration of client SSDs in those systems, consistent with our expectations though by the way, but that further disconnects us from the overall unit numbers that you might see from a PC perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman: Hi guys this is Keith here, sorry if there’s any background noise. But my question I want to focus back on the SanDisk still because I didn’t have the opportunity to ask a question. More specifically I am still struggling to see how the SanDisk deal is creating shareholder value. One of the ten multiple companies is buying a 30 multiple company. And Steve the question I want to pose to you if I could, I want to understand what your fundamental assumption is about the SanDisk (inaudible) as you look out over the next two to three years and how do you reach that conclusion particularly with some thoughts surrounding what I think about is the retail business or the replacement and card and then I have a follow-up also related to SanDisk.
Steve Milligan: The short answer to your question Keith is do we expect the SanDisk business to grow overtime? The answer to that is yes. And we see growth opportunities won and helping to expand our broader footprint in terms of the enterprise SSD area where we think that not normally is that an area that’s outpacing overall market growth but also a higher value opportunity to us. We also think that there’s growth opportunities in terms of client SSDs as well, certainly as it relates to our base business, and additionally we think that there is growth opportunity in terms of embedded solution [investor] things, so you’ve got tablets, cellphones etcetera (inaudible). Yes, related to the removables or the retail segment, that’s a great business but it’s not a growing business. So we fully understand and acknowledge that.
Keith Bachman: Okay. And may be if I could ask my follow-up then on the cost side, during the conference call last week I think you articulated broader synergies call it $500 million, and if I look at the cost structure of SanDisk alone, I would have thought there would have been more on OpEx, but maybe I did understand the characterization because you’re combining, maybe I didn’t understand the characterization of the 500 million opportunity, but I would have thought the companies there’d be frankly more opportunities to reduce costs over the next couple of years beyond 500 million. But if you could just flush that out a little bit and then I’ll cease the floor.
Steve Milligan: Sure. So a couple of comments on that. So when we talked about $500 million of synergies related to the SanDisk acquisition, we were specifically talking about, that was within 18 months of the close of the transaction. We did not indicate that that was the total synergies. In other words we do think that those there are additional opportunities. We have not quantified those or publicly talked about those at this point. The additional thing is that regarding that $500 million of synergies the lion share of that is related to the advantage that we would get by being vertically integrated as it relates principally to our enterprise SSD business. And there are some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that breakout specifically.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sherri Scribner: Steve I think you said you thought of the TAM and the fourth calendar quarter would be roughly flat. I was hoping if you could provide some detail on the different markets you mentioned that the PC market appears to be stabilizing. Can you give us some sort of directional commentary on the different end market for HDDs.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, I’ll give a little bit of color on that. So we would expect and these are pretty small changes though by the way. We would expect that we’ll see some softening in terms of gaming demand as well as in notebook demand offset by a little bit better enterprise demand. Again these are subtle changes that drives some of our margin improvement because we’ll get a little bit - when things play out the way we expect we’ll get a little bit of the mix benefit as a consequence of that.
Sherri Scribner: And then I think you also mentioned in your commentary that the active archive system is expected to drive meaningful revenue next year. Can you help us understand what type of TAM you think that product has, what’s the revenue opportunity for that product. Thank you.
Steve Milligan: So as we define that the active archive TAM we see that is a multi-billion dollar total addressable market for that solution. There’s both sort of currently defined version of that as well as we think a new green field opportunities to create market with that solution given its value propositions. So I would look at it as a multi-billion dollar market and growing at a fairly fast clip.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Monika Garg: Steve question on SanDisk acquisition, running a dry business is quite different than running a leading edge memory technology business. So maybe could you talk about the plan to retain SanDisk (inaudible) R&D team, and any execution risk in the integration you see.
Steve Milligan: So Monika, SanDisk has got some great people. We look forward to welcoming them to the team and we certainly intend to retain the talent that exists there, and certainly that talent that relates to those parts of the business that we don’t necessarily have the same experience, and then that’s certainly the semiconductor business. So we look forward to bringing them onboard.
Monika Garg: Do you see any execution risk in the integration?
Steve Milligan: Well there is execution risk in everything to be perfect, and the thing that I always focus the most on and investors will ask me often what do you worry about? I want to make sure that we everyday as a company dot I’s and cross T’s, and that’s what we do better than any company on the planet and that’s what we intend to do as we look to not only execute the WD/HGST trend integration but also as it relates to future integration of SanDisk. And so absolutely are there risks and we are going to manage that carefully and I am going to keep our teams intensely focused on that.
Monika Garg: And then given that Unis is entrusting 15% stake in WD, do you think it could add any regulatory risk for getting approval for the SanDisk acquisition?
Steve Milligan: Well we are proceeding with our application, in fact our application regarding [macifious] process that is in and has been expected. We were very careful as to how we structured that transaction and Unis’s representation on our Board, and we feel pretty good about that and we’re proceeding with regulatory review at this point, and we’ll keep you posted as things progress.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kathryn Huberty: I hope I do think your lead is in the 8 terabyte capacity drive space and then how would you expect that to change if at all as the industry moves to 10 terabytes.
Steve Milligan: Well it’s difficult to mention how far ahead we are, because we don’t have perfect visibility in to where our competition is. But let me make this comment, our 10 terabyte drive which we haven’t announced exactly when that will be available, its PMR based solution. And that’s depending upon how you encounter our third or fourth generation helium drive. There have been a lot of learnings along the way, and that we have developed and so when you got a three or four generation lead on your competition that’s fairly material lead. Now that being said, we fully respect our competition and we are not going to rest on our laurels, and we are going to keep marching forward.
Kathryn Huberty: And then a question on inventory, you commented on PC channel inventory coming down. Obviously we can see your balance sheet inventory that came down, but where do you think the industry is in terms of both channel inventory which has historically been quite low in recent quarters and also OEM inventory their manufacturing hubs.
Olivier Leonetti: The inventory is still within our range in the lower end of the range nevertheless.
Kathryn Huberty: And do you have any visibility in to the OEM inventory at their hubs?
Steve Milligan: We think that those are within comfortable ranges, but we don’t have any specific visibility as to any issues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Going back to your commentary regarding some share shift in the SSD, how do you see this evolving in to next year? And I have a follow-up.
Steve Milligan: That’s a difficult question to answer, how do we see share evolving in to next year. I mean obviously what we’re going to continue to do is execute on our product plan and continue to delight our customers and share will turn out where it will turn out, and so we are going to try to earn our business every day.
Mehdi Hosseini: Let me rephrase it as a follow-up, do you see new technologies like 3D NAND to become a catalyst looking to next year or your competitors just get in to margin and selling at a lower price. And as a follow-up to that, do you see a change in your driver especially SanDisk selling more of a hybrid product as a way to scale a rather niche segment of the market.
Steve Milligan: So let me comment on that, I think we see 3D as the next generation underlying media. We have plans to address products that are built on that in the future. So that will be part of our competitive profile and there are both of course economic benefit of that, but there are also product performance benefits in that architecture. So I think we’ll see the market go through a transition and we have our own internal plans in which to undertake that.
Mehdi Hosseini: So is your competition just basically sitting at depressed price is that what the competition has done?
Steve Milligan: We see continued competition around that market as it progresses, nothing is sort of outside of our general expectations.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And quickly on a hybrid drive is your strategy changing here especially with SanDisk inked with the part of your portfolio.
Steve Milligan: At this point we don’t have any specific changes we’d articulate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Thanks guys for taking the question, two if I could, the first is, with regards to TAM, TAM and exabyte go down this TAM stabilized and you guys are expected to remain inside sort of any particular range, and then in that context, what is sort of the overall exabyte growth market for (inaudible) you guys are looking for over the next handful of years and then I have a follow-up, thanks.
Olivier Leonetti: In terms of another overall exabyte growth for the market, we are predicting a 15% growth as a CAGR and particularly as it comes, capacity enterprise commented on that earlier, we see a 35% growth in CAGR.
Ananda Baruah: That’s very useful and then anything on the TAM range?
Steve Milligan: Longer term, we would expect that TAM to be flat to may be down low single digits.
Ananda Baruah: And then just as follow-up, I guess our work really completes summers as kind of pointed to PC, SSD pricing including some OEM grade stuff becoming a little bit more aggressive, than its typically had been and mostly recently had that. Just interesting in getting your view on if you’ve seen this yet, if it’s impacted unit placement in anyway and if you expect it to potentially have an impact going forward and that’s it.
Steve Milligan: You’re referring to PC/OEM pricing?
Ananda Baruah: Yeah on the SSD side, yeah PC related.
Steve Milligan: I would just comment that I don’t think we’ve seen anything notable from our perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig- Hallum Capital. Your line is open.
Christian Schwab: Steve I’m just wondering just back to SanDisk if you can explain the big question we get is whether this is defensive strategy or an offensive strategy. In other word, is buying SanDisk your absolute best strategy for you to take on given your decline in industry or is more an offensive strategy in the fact that you believe exabyte growth is going to continue to grow and HDDs and solid-state drives will co-exist for an extended period of time, and therefore you are best suited to serve a customer that’s also consolidating.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, so one comment and not to take offense to whether the question is phrased, but I don’t know if I necessarily like the characterizing that is either offensive or defensive. This is a strategy that we’ve thought about quite a bit. We think it is going to be good for our shareholders, good for our customers and it’s going to allow our company and our business to grow. So if you want to characterize that as offensive then feel free to do so.
Christian Schwab: Okay, that’s fair. And then as you look at just the disk drive business Steve is my follow-up question, as we look out at a TAM that kind of follows a flat to low-single digit, given the mix and complexity of enterprise drives as well as bigger capacity branded drives being shipped, we’ve made great progress on non-PC revenue as a mix of our business and actually over the last four years its modestly grown. Three or four years from now, do you believe that is the lion share of the percentage of revenue?
Steve Milligan: Yes. Now what percentage we’ll have to see, and we certainly haven’t called anything out publicly. But clearly the mix of our business in the traditional hard drive space is improving. And as it improves and as the PC related part becomes a frankly smaller and smaller part of our business, sooner or later there’s going to be an inflexion point, it will begin to show improvement in revenues and in terms of the overall hard drive market as well as a better margin posture as it relates to that underlying business. So the hard drive business remains a great business, it’s just a mix of shifting, right in a favorable way.
Christian Schwab: I think several investors may be missing that. I appreciate you answering that. Thanks Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney: First question is on the strategy of the company in China going forward and post all that you’ve announced should we expect any changes in how WD plans to do business or any other types of partnerships you may be lucky to form especially given that (inaudible) has other - as we make another investment in collaboration with US technology.
Steve Milligan: Yeah, nothing to talk about at this point. Obviously we are going to continue to evaluate and think through our go-to-market strategy in China. China as a market first up it’s a huge market, it’s a growing market, its evolving market. As you see some of the hyper scale guys there grow or telecom companies’ etcetera, etcetera, we’re going to have to look at ways that we evolve our go-to-market capabilities in that market, but nothing specifically to talk about now.
Mark Delaney: Question on the gross margin, certainly when some of the preliminaries all started to come out from HDD companies with more of margins, there’s a lot of concern in the market that there was an increase in pricing pressure. I know you commented that the decline at the WD was due to mix. I was actually wondering if you could just talk about pricing trend within some of the segments can you translate on a quarter-to-quarter basis (inaudible) some pricing increases on some of the categories and also you talked about in the past being sell products especially Helium products on a [CCO] basis. So any color you could provide on pricing within segments would be helpful.
Steve Milligan: So relative to what we saw, again our margin decline on a quarter-on-quarter basis was purely driven and mix related. And I don’t think there’s anything unusual from our perspective to call out on the pricing front.
Operator: Our last question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Just a moderate question, days inventory that has been elevated for three quarters on a year-over-year basis, are we expecting that to continue to be the case?
Olivier Leonetti: Yes, we are managing our cash flow tightly and we would expect the flow not to have been achieved. So we think we can improve further on this metric.
Nehal Chokshi: And then this has been addressed to a certain extent, but I’d like to try tease it out a little bit more. The $500 million of OpEx synergies with SanDisk, from my understanding there is three main bucket - I am sorry not OpEx synergies overall synergies. There are three main buckets from where this is going to come from PC express sales overlap, branded distribution, and interphase engineering. And if there’s anything else I’m missing please let me know, but can you rank order what you believe each of these are going to be in terms of magnitude.
Steve Milligan: Well the first thing is just to clarify we haven’t called any of that out in terms of what you’re talking about. I am not going to comment specifically on that. What we have said is that the lion share of that $500 million will be the benefit that we will get by being vertically integrated in our SSD business or existing SSD business. And there will be some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that. And by the way the other thing is that we’ve indicated the 500 million will be 18 months after the close of the transaction, which basically means that there will be further synergies beyond that 18 months period that we have to quantify publicly.
Operator: We have one more question from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Joe Wittine: I want to go off on the same topic. So the 500 million in synergies it seems like you’re describing Steve as these are benefits from owning the raw material in-house. So is that really a synergy I guess or is that just kind of recapturing the profit that SanDisk would have brought on otherwise. I guess my question is, when you add one plus one does it equal two plus 500 million, right if you could just clarify that one more time, I think it would help.
Steve Milligan: Well it’s exclusive of the benefits that we’ll get from the existing SanDisk business. So its additive to whatever you might happen to estimate that the existing SanDisk business would be able to generate. So its additive.
Joe Wittine: And then just be crystal clear, this includes no OpEx at all, no elimination of public company expenses that sort of thing, it’s a very conservative number.
Steve Milligan: I don’t know if I used the word conservative, but it does include an estimate of some OpEx synergies. But we haven’t quantified specifically what the OpEx versus the vertical integration benefits. We haven’t quantified that difference. But we’ve also indicated that we would expect that number to increase overtime beyond that 18 month period.
Operator: At this time, we no longer have questions on queue.
Steve Milligan: So thank you again for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution, and our customers for their continued business. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. So that concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating, you may now disconnect.

Presentation:
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital’s fourth quarter financial results for fiscal year 2015. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you, as we being I would like to mention that we’ll be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning, among others, our product and technology positioning. Customer acceptance of our SaaS SSD products our outlook for enterprise and SSD businesses, data growth and its drivers enterprise storage and our ability to address this space. Our non-PC business in the PC market demand and our ability to respond the demand changes. China's Ministry of Commerce matters, optimizing our business, anticipating contribution from our new businesses than our financial performance including our financial results, expectations for the September quarter and earnings expectations for the second half of fiscal 2016. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 12th, 2015. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet that we have posted on our Investor Relations section of our website. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. I also want to note that copies of remarks of today’s commentary by our Chief Executive Officer and CFO will be available on the investor section of our website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I’ll now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Steve Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected given a week PC market. In that context I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning coupled with solid execution. Our enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SaaS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering. It is been qualified with several leading customers and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016. We saw strong demand for our high-capacity helium and 15K RPM 2.5 inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose filed solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for enterprise storage business remains healthy and we believe we are well position to address this growing market space. Regarding PC market demand we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said we are seeing early signs of market stabilization. Leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up towards the end of this calendar year. On more stable PC market demand environment coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the mean time we will continue to be discipline to the management of our business while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes. I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential time table for them to complete their work. We have submitted a comprehensive report on the current market which we believe shows that the storage eco-system has evolved significantly in the last three years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We have also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our view on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hol separate in the near future. Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook.
Olivier Leonetti: Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.2 billion. We shipped a total of 48.5 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8% and operating expenses totaled $560 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 7% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis net income of $356 million or $1.51 per share. In the June quarter we generated $488 million in cash from operation and our free cash flow totaled $332 million. Our CapEx totaled $156 million of 5% of revenue we repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed year end with total cash and cash equivalent of $5 billion of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S. I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, excluding the amortization of intangibles we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat with our June quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $575 million and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60. Operator we are now ready attend the call for questions.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital’s third quarter results for fiscal year 2015. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you, I want to mention as we begin that we’ll be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among others, our position and opportunities in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem, the growth areas in storage, our management of short-term market dynamics, our focus on long-term value creation, our capital location, exit by shipments, macro economic conditions, optimization of our infrastructure, [indiscernible] restriction of MOFCOM, our ability to meet any unexpected increase in our products, demand outlook and our financial performance including our financial results expectations for the June quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10 Q filed with the SEC on January 10th, 2015. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The non-GAAP forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the ago convictions of HGST, sTec, VeloBit and Virident data. Because we currently can’t fully quantify future amounts for those excluded items we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. We ask that participants today limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question if they have one. I also want to note that the copies of remarks from today’s call will be available investor section of on the Western Digital’s website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I’ll turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Milligan.
Stephen Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. For the third fiscal quarter we reported revenues of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 31.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.87. I am satisfied with our execution and results in light of the PC demand challenges what were largely driven by weak macroeconomic conditions. We delivered a solidly profitable quarter with continued strong cash generation, improved average selling price, and healthy gross margins. Overall, our storage shipments for the March quarter were 61exo of bytes up 14% year-over-year. We continue to carefully balance the management of short-term market dynamics with a strong focus on long-term value creation. This is reflected in our balanced approach to capital location. Fiscal year-to-date we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders and share repurchases and dividends, while continuing to invest in high-growth market opportunities. We continue to make strong progress on several strategic growth initiatives. Our enterprise SSD business was accretive for the quarter and grew revenues by 67% year-over-year to $224 million. We also launched our new ultrastar MPME solutions in the enterprise space addressing the industry transition to standards-based PCIE solutions. We surpassed 1 million helium hard drive deployments and are now ramping our new 8 terabyte helium PMR sealed drives. We shipped our first active archive system, a new category of high value-added archival storage product addressing a market of approximately $15 billion. We completed the acquisition of Amplidata, a key building block of our vertical innovation strategy for active archive systems. We expanded our line of purpose-built drives for the fast-growing surveillance video recording space, and we launched four new models of high-performance NAS systems for the SMB space. These initiatives provide revenue expansion opportunities for our company as we leverage our capabilities and resources in the rapidly changing storage ecosystem. Turning to our outlook, we continue to see growth in exabyte shipments during calendar 2015 and beyond. However, we anticipate that global macroeconomic headwinds will persist in the short-term, further impacting PC sales. Given this we are cautious with regards to our near-term outlook. We believe this is prudent in the current environment and consistent with our focus on long-term value creation. That being said, we are fully prepared to meet any upside in demand that may occur as we progress through the June quarter. We are optimistic that the demand environment will improve in the second half of the year. We will continue to optimize our infrastructure and related investments to the current demand profile. That being said, our ability to respond to changing market dynamics is affected by the MOFCOM hold separate restriction. This is one of the central arguments that I continue to make in our regular interactions with MOFCOM. Lifting the hold separate restriction would be beneficial to consumers and our customers by promoting innovation and enhancing the competitive environment. Olivier will now provide a summary of our March quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter.
Olivier Leonetti: Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the March quarter was $3.5 billion. We ship a total of 54.5 million hard drives at the average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1% and operating expenses totaled $591 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $28 million or 7% of pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $441 million or $1.87 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, in the March quarter we generated $684 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $534 million. Our CapEx totaled $150 million, or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $240 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion of which approximately $880 million was held in the U.S. I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, gross margin percentage to be around the midpoint of our business model of 27% to 32%. Operating expenses of approximately $590 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.50 and $1.60 for the June quarter. Operator, we’re now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. [Operator instructions] One moment, please, for the first question. The first question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman: Hi, guys. My first question, if you could just review your perspective on the TAM for us in terms of how you see that progressing in the June quarter relative to 125. And any other comments, you said you were optimistic on the second half of the year then how do you foresee that TAM unfolding? And then I’ll ask my follow-up, please.
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, so Keith, let me give a little bit of color on the demand environment. So you’re right in terms of fiscal Q3. We think that -- we haven’t seen Toshiba’s numbers published as of yet, but we think that the TAM for fiscal Q3 was about 125 million units. Coming into the quarter, we would have expected the TAM to be something in the range of 135, right?
Keith Bachman: That’s right.
Stephen Milligan: The weakness that we saw during the quarter was entirely attributable to weakness in the PC market, largely driven by weakness from a broader global macroeconomic perspective. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we expect that those headwinds from a global macroeconomic perspective are going to persist going into the second quarter, again, affecting PC sales. And we think that the TAM will be something in around the 120 million a unit range.
Keith Bachman: Okay.
Stephen Milligan: Now, one other point to indicate, from an enterprise demand perspective, whether that be enterprise demand for traditional customers or for cloud-related customers, demand there continues to be healthy. And came in pretty much along our expectations, both from an industry perspective and as well as from a company perspective. And then going into the second half of the year, we are optimistic that the demand environment will improve, primarily due to a few things. One, we do expect that PC sales will pick up or we’re optimistic in that regard. We’ll begin to see a seasonal uptick relating to gaming units. And then we’ll also see a seasonal uptick from a demand perspective in terms of things like our branded business, those more consumer-oriented segments.
Keith Bachman: Right, right.
Stephen Milligan: Coupled with continued strength in terms of the enterprise market.
Keith Bachman: Okay. Great. Well, let me ask my follow-up, then, if I could, Stephen. Your employment levels in Q3 FY12 post-deal were a little over 106,000. The information sheet you put out this afternoon said your employment levels were about 81,000 total world head count. How is it you’ve been able to take head count down so meaningfully over that period? And if you could just reiterate the incremental -- if, in fact, you’re granted MOFCOM relief -- the incremental cost reductions you see once relief, or if relief, is granted? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, keep in mind that most of our head count from a total head count perspective is concentrated in our factories.
Keith Bachman: Right.
Stephen Milligan: We have worked that head count level down over time primarily through attrition.
Keith Bachman: Okay.
Stephen Milligan: And so, you know, not replacing workers that decide to move on for further employment. And if we go to the question on MOFCOM, what we have said, and we continue to say is that we expect that from an operating expense perspective, that we would realize approximately $100 million of OpEx savings a quarter. We have not quantified the savings that we would anticipate on the cost line item, but we have indicated that we would expect that to be meaningful.
Keith Bachman: Okay, thanks, guys, I would cede the floor.
Stephen Milligan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, I do have a follow-up as well. First looking at the outlook, when we look at the midpoint of your gross margin guidance, and also in the context of your expectation of enterprise remaining relatively healthy, I’m just trying to bridge the expectation of a decline in gross margin down into the 29.5% range. What’s the underlying drivers of that? And why wouldn’t mix shift towards enterprise offset some of the weakness we’re seeing in the PCs and actually be a positive on gross margin?
Olivier Leonetti: So let me take this one. The margin decline in the quarter is going to be mainly attributed to absorption impact. That’s the main driver. And as Steve has indicated we expect the margin to pick up in the second half of the calendar year at the back of, a bounce back of the PC market and also some increased demand in the enterprise segment.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a follow-up and related to the enterprise business, it looks like you guys were down a bit more so relative to your closest competitor which I think was flat sequentially. Can you talk about the competitive landscape, whether or not you’ve seen any kind of changes in pricing in the enterprise market or any reasons why maybe you might have underperformed your competitor in that space?
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, so one of the things to keep in mind in terms of, well, one overall share and in particular enterprises share, things are going to -- share is going to shift a little bit quarter to quarter and particularly in the enterprise space, I hate to use the word lumpy because it tends to be a little bit overused but it tends to come in bigger chunks in terms of we can have a customer that we’re particularly strong with that may provide a little bit of incremental volume or the flip side could be true of our largest competitor and so share can move around a little bit more quarter-to-quarter from an enterprise perspective. But the important thing to keep in mind, there’s a few important things to keep in mind. One is, is that we’re very comfortable with our product positioning in that space and also very comfortable with the positioning from a customer perspective. And then the last comment that I will indicate is that we’ve also got to keep in mind that unit share is one indicator, but it is not the only indicator. You also have to look at revenue share as well as margin share. And in that regard, we’re particularly pleased with how we performed in the past quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. I will cede the floor as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. Your line is open.
Rich Kugele: Thank you, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just if you could talk a little bit more about the SSD business, strong growth there this quarter, and, Stephen, you had mentioned I think in previous calls that you expected during the first half of calendar 2013 particular growth maybe on the PCIe side in that business so could you elaborate what you’re seeing in SSDs and what that revenue is comprised of?
Stephen Milligan: Sure, Rich. Most of our revenue today is coming from our enterprise -- or the SaaS enterprise SSD offering that we have that we co developed with Intel. We continue to see strong receptivity to our product and good traction there. As I had in my prepared remarks, we’ve recently announced our PCIe/MME offering and what we’re seeing in that space which we have been anticipating for a while is a move away from proprietary-based PCIe solutions to call it a standards-based NBME solution. We’ll begin to see the impact of that from a revenue perspective as we move through the balance of 2015 from a calendar year perspective and so as of right now that is not meaningfully indicated, at least our revenue performance over the past quarter.
Rich Kugele: Would you expect the SSD business to remain profitable over the balance of calendar 2015? Or has that moved on now?
Stephen Milligan: Yes. And I’ll even go further than that, Rich, on that, I would expect that our profitability level will improve.
Rich Kugele: Excellent. OK. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from James Kisner with Jeffries. Your line is open.
James Kisner: Yes, thank you. So I guess one quick clarification here, you talked about MOFCOM again in your script and made another strong case for why you should be able to integrate. Is there any update at all on the feedback you’re getting from MOFCOM right now?
Stephen Milligan: Sure. Let me provide a little bit of color on that. The -- so we continue, as I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we continue to have frequent communications with MOFCOM. That includes myself. So, you know, and members of the management team. On the positive side, I am encouraged by the frequency of those communications and the substance of those communications. Where I am not pleased is with regards to the pace of decision-making or the transparency of that decision-making. And so one of the things that in a constructive way we continue to push is to help us understand exactly what the decision-making process is going to be and the timeframe associated with that. So that is where the frustration is just the timing and the nature or process surrounding that decision-making.
James Kisner: Great, that’s helpful and just a follow-up. You guys have been seeing visibility with hyperscale is getting better. Is that still the case? Do you anticipate you can still see a meaningful uptick in the back half, thank you?
Stephen Milligan: Relative to hyperscale demand, we feel comfortable about our visibility right now through the balance of calendar 2015. And, again, as I alluded to in our prepared remarks, we’re expecting to see strong petabyte growth particularly in the hyperscale accounts. The one question which I had talked about on our earnings call last quarter is the question is how will that specifically impact our unit demand which is a function of the deployment of new capacity points as well as the acceptance of those new capacity points on behalf of our customers. So, for example, as we deployed an eight-terabyte drive what will be the take rate on that by our customers and obviously if you ship an eight-terabyte you don’t knee a two or four terabytes. So the impact is the one that’s a little bit more variable. But what we do feel very strongly about is continued growth in petabyte growth in hyperscale deployments.
James Kisner: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital markets, your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Stephen when I look at your OpEx numbers it appears the long-term target of 10% to 12% you guys have, you’re running at about 16.6% or so right now. I think half of that is attributable to the MOFCOM number you talked about. But I’m curious what do you think helps you realize the other half of the operating margin, is it leverage? Is it mixed? And how are you going to achieve the targets as you go forward beyond MOFCOM?
Stephen Milligan: You’re right, a large portion of that delta is due to lack of synergies from related to the whole separate situation. The other thing is, which is don’t mean this to sound as a cop out because it may sound like a copout but keep in mind that our OpEx model was set back in September of 2012. One of the things that we need to do as the composition of our business changes and our investments change accordingly is a resetting of that model appropriate. I’m not suggesting that it is or it is not. It’s just something that we would have to contemplate. But clearly, one of the things that we’re going to have to do as we move forward is look at ways at optimizing our expenditures and, you know, we talk about that in terms of managing short-term dynamics with longer term value creation. And that becomes a bit more challenging as you see, as we did in this past quarter, a faster deceleration in the PC market largely driven by temporal factors.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. And if I could just follow up, could you just touch on pride and dynamics, I think there was a big discussion last quarter but what are you seeing on the pricing side both on enterprise and the PC side and does that change as you get in the June quarter? Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: We have not as I said, last time on our earnings call and it was very consistent. Pricing was within our expectations. We did not see anything that was outside of our expectations. I will add one thing that as we look at this quarter from a demand perspective and anytime you do a demand forecast, the only thing that I know is that the demand may be higher or lower than what we expect. Right now we are taking a cautious view because it feels like the risk factors associated with a lower demand environment are greater than it being a higher level of demand. And we believe that is prudent because we all know what happens question we happen to oversupply the industry.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Yu with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Joe Yu: Thank you. Stephen, I want to ask about inventory levels, if I could. There has been some recent data points suggesting that distributors, especially in Europe and Asia, are excessively bringing down the level of hardware inventory due to currency. What’s your view of inventory in the channel and that the ODMs relatively to normal levels?
Stephen Milligan: So a couple comments on that. Generally speaking, when we look at inventory levels, we think that they are within manageable ranges. That being said, one of the comments that you indicated, when we look at our distribution business, our distribution business was down pretty meaningfully in Europe. And that is largely driven by the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar. And so we’re sensitive to that. We’ve tried to do, manage our business appropriately and manage those inventory levels. But as our customers in Europe are seeing a compression on their business driven by the U.S. dollar, that clearly puts pressure on our business as well.
Joe Yu: Great, thank you. And as a follow-up, on the SSD business, I mean, it’s well-known that SanDisk is struggling, it’s one of your meaningful competitors on the SaaS-side due to qualification issues. How much of the acceleration you’ve seen on your business on SSDs was attributed to share gains as opposed to the actual market accelerating?
Stephen Milligan: Well, we’ve had a pretty strong share position in the SaaS market for a while. I would not attribute our strong performance in this past quarter in any material way to any missteps on SanDisk’s part.
Joe Yu: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sherri Scribner: Hi, thanks. Stephen, I was hoping you could provide a little more detail on your view as to why the second half will improve from a PC perspective, and also maybe some commentary on the enterprise side. Just wanted to know if you’re hearing anything from customers that suggest they also think demand will improve in the second half, or is that driven by Windows 10 or what that belief is based on. Thanks.
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, so just, Sherri, not to mince words but we’re optimistic that the demand environment will improve. Obviously, we’ll have to continue to keep an eye on that. The reasons that we’re optimistic is we do believe that the PC market will improve or we’re optimistic that it will improve, I should clarify that. We will see seasonal uptick in demand from the gaming segment. And we will continue to see or expect to continue to see strength in the broader enterprise market. I don’t know if I would characterize the enterprise -- Enterprise market has been consistent with our expectations. I don’t know if I would say that I’m expecting an acceleration of that in the back half of the year. I think that we’re expecting a continued strong demand environment in the broader enterprise market, including hyperscale.
Sherri Scribner: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Jayson Noland: Okay, great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding the potential impact of Windows 10. Intel suggested that there was some channel reduction in front of Win 10 and there’d be a channel fill in the back half. Would that play a role in an optimistic view on the second half?
Stephen Milligan: Yes, Jayson. And we concur with that.
Jayson Noland: Okay, well, a follow-up question on active archives. If you could talk a little bit to the financial profile, competitive dynamics there, and any potential sales and marketing investment. Just curious to see your thoughts there on how that should play out here.
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, so one of the things -- there’s really a few things to keep in mind, Jayson, on the active archive product. I mean, really we’re going after a bit of a Greenfield opportunity where we’re seeing data that today maybe isn’t stored because it’s not economical or it may be stored on other media, for example, tape and that sort of thing. And so we’re sort of blazing some trails there from a market perspective and doing that in a way that we believe is synergistic with our existing customer base. From a financial perspective I don’t believe that we have had presence, indicated specifically what that financial profile will look like other than to say that it would be accretive to our existing gross profit profile. And so far in terms of customer reaction we have shipped units and customer reaction so far has been very positive.
Jayson Noland: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. And going back to your guide for 120 million TAM units for the June quarter, I’m just curious, what kind of a consumer pieces you have built in and are you expecting units to be up, flat, or down in June compared to the March quarter?
Olivier Leonetti: We would expect the decline business to keep declining, putting a number behind that would be a bit difficult. Probably less precipitous to what we have observed in the March quarter but some level of decline.
Mehdi Hosseini: That’s fair. So similar to Intel, if the month of June turned out to be better than earlier in the quarter, you could see some upside and you could see upside to the TAM units. Fair?
Stephen Milligan: That’s correct. And that’s why we indicated again in my prepared remarks that if demand ends up being better than we expected we’ll be there to meet it.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And then one -- the other question I have is regarding the enterprise. I’m kind of surprised, I haven’t seen any acceleration growth in overall server investment in advance of the operating system expiration and there are two coming up. Is this something that you think has already played out or is yet to play out or is not going to have much of an impact on the hardware procurement?
Stephen Milligan: We haven’t really seen that one way or the other so I don’t think it’s had much impact. If we look at demand for storage products or storage components in server-based systems, it’s been pretty steady. So not a real, big increase one way or the other or decrease so I don’t think it’s having much of an impact.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it, Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. So the exabyte data gives us the ability to look at price per terabyte which was down a healthy 80% year-over-year on effectively flat gross margins. So this implies that cost productions are in line with the price per terabyte reductions and that’s very good. Can you help tease out how much is due to mix shift in your line versus the inherent like for like price declines you’re seeing right now. And I will have a follow-up.
Stephen Milligan: Yeah, most of it, more and a lion’s share of that is growth in its mix-up is most of that.
Nehal Chokshi: It is indeed mostly mix-up.
Stephen Milligan: Absolutely.
Nehal Chokshi: Now, the advance storage consortium which you guys are a part of recently released a ten year road map showing for a 10x increase aerial density. And I understand there’s going to be an increased unit cost to get there due to hammer as well as bit pattern media but I would think this still implies a seven x bit price decline over the same timeframe or, basically, a 22% price per bit decline significantly faster than your current trend and potentially faster and further than what the nanoFLASH camera can accomplish do you have any pushback on that assertion there?
Stephen Milligan: Well, honestly that’s a lot of data to sort of throw out straightaway. It would require a little bit further analysis. But we continue to believe that from a competitive positioning standpoint we will remain, you know, particularly in the enterprise space, we will remain cost competitive in terms of any other solution. So generally speaking I would say, yes, I agree with your assertion.
Nehal Chokshi: My assertion is likely a lot more aggressive than what Seagate or I believe you guys have intimated in the past. And so that’s what I’m checking in on basically.
Stephen Milligan: All right. Thank you for your question.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you.
Stephen Milligan: Thank you, again, for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business. Thank you so much.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-01-27 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital Second Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2015. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Sir, you may begin. 
Bob Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among other topics, our position and opportunities in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage, our investment focus, our product offerings and our customers' responses to our product offerings; and demand outlook and our financial performance, including our financial results, expectations for the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 4, 2014, and those listed in our registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on November 5, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.
 In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The non-GAAP forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, sTec, VeloBit and Virident, and employee termination, asset impairment, litigation-related and other charges. Because we currently cannot quantify future amounts for those excluded items, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.
 [Operator Instructions]. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call by Steve Milligan and Olivier Leonetti will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. And I now turn the call over to President and CEO, Steve Milligan. 
Stephen Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.
 I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award.
 The diversified nature of our business, together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, continued to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations.
 In our business, we saw a particular strength and demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for Enterprise SSDs. As anticipated, there was a seasonal demand uptick for branded products.
 We expect ongoing hyperscale cloud deployments, coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model, to continue fueling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Petabyte growth in this category is expected to remain strong. Our Flash Platform Solutions business, which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs, maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter, delivering revenue of $187 million.
 The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in client, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand in capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced.
 I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market's response to our strategic growth initiatives, which we believe position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem.
 We have strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.
 We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter. Our broad lineup of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we have seen strong customer acceptance of our WD Purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched the 6-terabyte model in the December quarter that has been well received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space, given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide.
 There continues to be strong growth momentum in branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and pro-sumer markets. The My Cloud software and apps have now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide.
 We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced Active Archive platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running, and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density petascale capacities in a single rack, and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. And as a reminder, we expect revenue growth from our Flash Platform's business to outpace that of the industry.
 Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, a well-diversified business, leading products and a customer-centric engagement model. Olivier? 
Olivier Leonetti: Thank you, Steve. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in October. In our business, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise.
 Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain within our 4- to 6-week range. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our Flash Platform Solutions group.
 We shipped a total of 61 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall LSP was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance, along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products.
 Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%, which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.
 Operating expenses totaled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and the flood insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights.
 Tax expense for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pretax income. The tax rate reflects the retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter.
 Our net income totaled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax credit.
 Turning to the balance sheet. In the December quarter, we generated $243 million in cash from operations and a free cash flow -- and our free cash flow totaled $97 million. As a reminder, we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter.
 Our CapEx totaled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.
 We closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.
 I will now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion; gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the tax rate of approximately 7.5%; and the share count of approximately 237 million.
 Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.90 and $2.00 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Amit Daryanani: I guess, just 2 questions and I guess a follow-up here. First of all, can you just talk on the pricing dynamic that you guys are seeing in this quarter and potentially in the March quarter? One of your peers reported a couple of days ago and they talked extensively about pricing concerns starting to creep up. So I'm curious what you guys are seeing. What do you guys are expecting as you go forward? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, so if you look at -- and this is Steve. If you look at our fiscal Q2, so the quarter we just finished, and that's consistent with my commentary, we saw nothing unusual from a pricing perspective versus our expectations. And we see nothing unusual this quarter from a pricing perspective. So what I would say is that pricing behavior and price levels are just simply consistent with our expectations. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And if I can just follow up on MOFCOM. You guys issued a press release in December talking about the letter you guys received and the rectification you're doing. Is there any update on that as you go forward? Is there a timeline that we'd start to think about given the fact that you had the update in December? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So let me review where we're at. We did announce recently that there were a couple of compliance issues that we had that were resolved with MOFCOM. We were pleased to get those issues behind us. We also indicated that given the resolution of those issues, MOFCOM is now fully focused on reviewing our application. Those issues needed to get resolved before MOFCOM begin the formal evaluation of our application. They have hold separate lifted. That is in process and ongoing. And as I've indicated before, our relationship and dialogue with MOFCOM is consistent and constructive. But at this point, I can't provide any update as to the timing as to when MOFCOM will provide any sort of ruling. But we're working with them in a constructive fashion and we'll continue to do so. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. 
Richard Kugele: A couple of questions. First, can you just talk about the capacity enterprise segment and your ability to ship especially given some of the data center buildout plans as calendar '15 unfolds? 
Stephen Milligan: Sure. So yes, we, this past quarter, saw good demand for our products, for capacity enterprise products, particularly from hyperscale customers. We expect that to continue. In the last call, I talked about having good visibility to the middle part of calendar 2015. That statement remains valid. Really, what we're seeing is we're seeing meaningful growth in terms of petabyte deployments on behalf of our customers. We expect that to continue through the balance of calendar 2015. How that translates to a unit performance perspective is a little bit unknown at this point. It will vary depending upon the capacity point that is shipped as the industry transitions initially from a 4-terabyte drive to a 6-terabyte drive; and then eventually, at least for us, to an 8-terabyte deployment. But we are confident that we're going to continue to see strong petabyte growth for our business and for the industry in the capacity enterprise space. 
Richard Kugele: And you're comfortable with your component supply and ability to go and hit those demands? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, I mean, there's a little bit of a qualification. It's a kind of a yes and no answer, Rich. Supply is tight. We're comfortable with where we're at, but it's tight. And so we're watching that closely. And so these things -- they use a lot of heads and discs, a lot of test time. And so we've got to be watching that closely. But right now, relative to our expectations, we're comfortable with where we're at. But if we see more variability from an upside perspective, which is obviously possible, we could have -- we could run into some supply challenges. 
Richard Kugele: Okay. And then I'll ask an obligatory TAM question. In the December quarter, obviously, 141 million, lighter than what your competitor was talking about, but not too surprising. When you look at normal seasonality, how would you look at the March quarter? What should we be expecting? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So to reiterate when I talk about in terms of my comments, and I know that there were some analysts had different numbers out there, but the TAM for the December quarter pretty much turned out the way that we expected. So a TAM -- and we'll see what numbers Toshiba publishes, but a TAM in the 141 million unit range was very consistent with the expectations that we had going into the quarter. I would say that if you want to call it a surprise, the mix might have been a little bit better than what we thought and therefore, you see a bit higher revenue for us and resulting margin benefit associated with that. If we look at where we think the TAM will shake out in March, I think, something in that mid-130 million range is kind of a reasonable assumption. 
Operator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. 
Aaron Rakers: I do have a follow-up as well. Going back on the enterprise business, can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? When we look at the numbers and look at what some of your component suppliers have reported, it would appear that Toshiba saw a pretty healthy quarter in enterprise shipments. So can you talk about seeing Toshiba being at all a disrupter and going after some of those high-capacity deals? And if not, whether you think that changes on a going-forward basis? 
Stephen Milligan: We didn't see anything unusual in that regard. If we look at what happened in terms of our enterprise shipments, and I'm sort of using rough numbers here, I think our units increased on a quarter-on-quarter basis, about 300,000 units. And a bit of that was capacity enterprise, a bit of that was performance enterprise. If you recall, one of the things that we were focused on from a performance enterprise perspective was to continue to broaden our product portfolio so that we had full coverage from a market perspective. We began shipping our 15K small form factor drive, which allowed us to pick up some incremental business in the performance enterprise space. And with our strong portfolio and position in the capacity enterprise business, we were able to increase our business a bit there. We believe, although we'll have to see how the final numbers shake out, that we maybe gained a little bit of share in that space. And so we're, obviously, pleased with that from a customer, call it, satisfaction perspective. But we did not see anything from a competitive dynamic perspective in that space that was unusual or shall we say, alarming from our perspective. 
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe a higher level question, but when you guys think about your capital structure and kind of the return of cash going forward, your closest competitor raised a very impressive 20-year note in this latest quarter. How are you guys thinking about your return of capital and cash? And in particular, how you guys think about the dividend trajectory on a going-forward basis, obviously, in the context of the U.S. held cash? 
Olivier Leonetti: So let me take this question. So we are always evaluating the way we deploy our capital, and we believe that the current allocation is probably a good balance between short-term management and long-term investments, prudent long-term investments in the business. And at this stage, we have no particular plan to change the current capital allocation but again, under evaluation all the time. To answer to your question, specifically, about U.S. cash and how that is a constraint, we have a fair amount of liquidity in U.S. through our cash balances, $1.4 billion at this stage; but also a debt capacity, which is quite high as well. Our leverage ratio is in the range of 4.7x, and as you know. So we can sustain our current allocation for at least 4 years or more. 
Stephen Milligan: So one thing just to add to that is that we -- the key thing is, is that we're focused on longer-term value creation and making sure that we have a capital structure that enables us to do that. And obviously, the dynamics that influence that, our needs for cash, uses of cash, all of that, but it's centered fundamentally on what do we need to do as a business to make sure that we are creating a long-term value for ourselves and our shareholders going forward. 
Operator: Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. 
Keith Bachman: I had 2 as well. Steve, I want to start with you. You indicated that pricing was consistent with your views. I wonder if you could flush it out a little more. What were like-for-like pricing, either in December quarter and/or what are you expecting in the March quarter? And against that trajectory, are the near-line or enterprise performance drives deviating from the overall pattern associated with the rest of your product portfolio? 
Stephen Milligan: As an overall statement, Keith, we have been seeing, I would call it, low -- more or less, low single-digit price declines like-for-like. And really, that's been holding more or less, I'll call it, constant or consistent on a relative basis over the last few quarters. And so frankly, we just did not see anything -- now, let me qualify, there's always pockets -- this is a competitive business. There's always pockets where pricing in this segment might be doing something a little bit unusual in here and there. But we did not see anything unusual from a pricing perspective, either last quarter or we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the March quarter period. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. But within that, just if you could flush out, is near line -- does that also embrace the near-line product portfolio that you're not seeing anything outside of that kind of low single-digit sequential declines? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, near line is a little bit different in the sense that -- but this again is not a change. I mean, the first thing is, is that there's a fair amount of margin on those products. We're also introducing higher capacity points in those products, 6-terabyte, I mean, preceded by a 4-terabyte. You're going to see declines for those capacity points that exceed the overall average but that's not anything unusual. And when it gets introduced, it may be in limited supply as it begins to -- as the supply begins to increase and you see greater customer acceptance of that. And as we come down the cost curve, the price declines tend to be steeper. But that, that is nothing at all unusual. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. And then Steve, I wondered as my follow-up question, if you wanted to provide your views. If the TAM comes out to a mid-130s as you said for the March quarter, how are you thinking about the TAM as you look out, particularly, with -- relates to PC clients. There's, I'm sure you're aware, a lot of consternation associated with what the PC market can deliver this year. I wondered if you could just provide some high-level views as you look out over the next couple of quarters on the HGST TAM and/or the PC client TAM, and that's it for me. 
Stephen Milligan: Sure. We would expect, at present, and of course, our expectations can change, that the March quarter will be the low point for the year. So at this point, for the June quarter, we think that we could see either a flat to maybe slightly up TAM in the June quarter. We'll, obviously, update our expectations for that as we move through the quarter. And then, obviously, as we move through the back half of the calendar year, where we get help from a seasonality perspective, we would expect to see the TAM increase from there. 
Operator: The next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies LLC. 
James Kisner: I guess, I just wanted to really sort of press more on the PC market or the client market. Your competitor went -- ventured, I guess, what the overall growth here might be for the year for client units. I think they said low single digits. Would you guys sort of agree with that? Do you have any view? 
Stephen Milligan: We have consistently indicated that we expect that PC sales will -- well, let me backup. What's been happening is, is that we've been seeing low single-digit decline on a year-on-year basis in the PC space. That's been consistent with our expectations. And we would expect that going forward that we'll continue to see that. As that relates to hard drive shipments into the PC segment, we also have to contemplate the fact that more and more client units are using solid-state devices versus rotating magnetic storage. And so our -- we will see more of a drag than that low single digit in terms of hard drives shipped into the PC market. And so that's very consistent with what we've been saying for the last several quarters and very consistent with our expectations. 
James Kisner: And the quick follow-up, just could you update us on the uptick of Helium? Is it -- did it contribute at all to the ASPs? Or just is it not a material factor there? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, so relative to Helium, let me kind of broaden that a little bit. Clearly, part of the reason that we saw uptick in terms of our ASPs and also our margins was due to the strength in our capacity enterprise business, of which Helium is a part of that. Helium, as an individual category, particularly as it relates to the 6-terabyte drive, probably did not have a material impact. We believe that as we transition to the 8-terabyte platform with the Helium product, we'll begin to see a bit of a larger impact. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. 
Sherri Scribner: I was hoping to get a little more detail on the surveillance market. You called it out as being strong this quarter. Can you give us a little more detail on the magnitude of that market and where it's represented in your unit numbers? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. Well, is it in the consumer electronics numbers? So our CE line on our data sheet is where the surveillance drives are contained, Sherri. And it's a market that we expect will grow in low single digit kind of growth rates. And so it's an expanding area. I mean, obviously, we've seen some of the news and the impact of that. And so it's a good market for us, and it also carries a gross margin profile that is above the overall corporate average. 
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. And then just thinking about the Enterprise SSD market, that business looks like it was up 20% for you guys year-over-year. What types of growth expectations do you have for that segment going forward? 
Olivier Leonetti: Yes. We had a very large order Q2 last year. If you look at the sequential, it's pretty strong. And we, as we have indicated that we'll expect to grow faster than the market, and the market is expected to grow at about 40%, and we're staying behind that trajectory. 
Operator: The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: How are you thinking about any risk of cloud vendors, either catching up with demand or getting through their investment cycle and some more lumpiness as we go into the back half? Is there any visibility or high-level thoughts on whether we could see lumpiness further out in that market? Then I have a follow-up. 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, Katy, that's something that we keep a close eye on. We're seeing, as I indicated, strong growth from a petabyte perspective. When we talk to our customers and they talk about what's happening from what they're seeing, they expect that petabyte growth to continue. But at times, they can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of their order flow, and we saw that last year. So we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. But it's something that we monitor pretty closely. But we're confident that overall data growth will continue to be very strong, it's just a matter of how the storage gets deployed against that where sometimes the lumpiness can potentially come in. 
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then Seagate is talking about turning over their entire product portfolio this calendar year. Is that something that impacts your OpEx? And if not, do you view yourself at any advantage or disadvantage as they go through that cycle? 
Stephen Milligan: We are not expecting there to be any abnormal increase, I guess, I'd say in terms of our operating expense as it relates to product deployments. I mean, we're continuing to invest in some of these new growth initiatives, but that's different than refreshing our base hard drive product set. So we would not expect that we would see, call it, a surge in our operating expenses as it relates to that. And we continue to expect that we're going to have a competitive product lineup to match up against our competitors. 
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Yoo of Citi Research. 
Joe Yoo: Steve, and I apologize that I'm asking another pricing question, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the weakness of the yen and its potential impact to hard drive pricing? And did it have any impact to your pricing strategy? Or do you think that maybe it affected Toshiba's behavior? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, that would be speculative, I don't know. And so it's a question that ultimately would need to be directed to Toshiba to get a more specific question. I would reiterate really one thing, and that relative to what we saw from a competitive dynamic perspective, we didn't really see anything that was particularly out of the ordinary. The other thing I'd add, which is just kind of an anecdotal comment, I was at Hitachi and the CEO there, and yen movements did not impact at all anything that we did. But I don't know how it impacts Toshiba. 
Joe Yoo: Great. And my follow-up is on the Flash Platform Solution, can you provide some tangible factors that give you the confidence that you can grow above the market? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, let me take the most tangible factor is we have been growing faster than the market. So I think that history is probably the thing that gives the most tangible proof of that. The other thing is, is that we have a product roadmap that we're focused on, that has been discussed and shared with our customers. We're sampling some new products with our customers. We're getting positive feedback. And so as we go through the development process and we go through, call it, the prequalification process with our customers, our confidence and our ability to grow faster than the market just continues to be solid. 
Operator: The next question from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Two, if I could. Steve, I'd love to get your view on the need for the industry margin structure to continue to rise as, I guess, as you talked about cloud demand in hyperscale picks up as the, I guess, as the supply environment there tends to tighten up, so the impact that, that could have onto sort of your ability to ship to overall TAM. I would love to get your thoughts there. And then I have a follow-up as well. 
Stephen Milligan: So let me sort of take that question in a different question rather than me speculating on where the industry margins go. Let me talk about the things that are impacting our business. What's fundamentally happening from our standpoint is that the secular forces, if you want to refer to it that way, are basically -- what's increasing is those elements of our business that carry higher margins. So we have a tailwind in effect that is pushing us to higher margin opportunities. Also the things that we're investing in, these strategic growth initiatives, generally speaking, carry higher margins. Right now, 58% of our business is "non-PC". And we know and we've said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there's less ability to differentiate, and accordingly those products, carry lower margin profiles. But as our revenue increases in the non-PC segment, generally carrying higher margins, we have a bias over time for our gross margins increasing as opposed to decreasing over time. That being said, we continue to have a stated gross margin range of 27% and 32%. But as these things continue to evolve, we'll look at whether or not we need to reevaluate that gross margin range. 
Ananda Baruah: Got it. That's really helpful, I appreciate it. And just as my follow-up, quickly, do you believe that the TAM has a chance to grow in 2015 over 2014? 
Stephen Milligan: We believe that we'll see low single-digit growth from an overall TAM perspective. 
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fox of Cross Research. 
Steven Fox: Steve, just going back over the pricing one more time. I understand what you're talking about, just typical pricing patterns, especially as you go up to higher capacities. It seems like your competitor is saying that the typical pricing shouldn't apply because of the rising complexities and the tighter components and just the overall cost of capacity. Can you just sort of react to that statement as to whether there is the potential for the industry to change in terms of how it looks at pricing as you go from, say, 4- to 6- to 8-terabyte products? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, it's kind of difficult for me to comment on that specifically. I mean, the bottom line to it is, is that I'm going to repeat 2 things, and that pricing was consistent with our expectations. And at the end of the day, in order for us to be able to do what we need to do, we have to have pricing that's competitive with the industry. Whatever that means in terms of what price declines are is whatever it means. But at the end of the day, we did not see anything particularly unusual, and remember that the margins in that business carry higher margins. I mean, we're comfortable in general with where we're positioned in that regard. 
Steven Fox: Fair enough, it was worth a shot. And then just as a quick follow-up. Your average capacity was up 24% year-over-year. Obviously, some of that or a lot of that was driven by the enterprise capacity drives. But can you sort of dissect that a little bit further and talk about how average capacity looks year-over-year in some of your other products? 
Olivier Leonetti: I mean, we could. Obviously, as Steve indicated, we saw a big increase year-on-year in exabyte in the capacity enterprise. If I look at the rest of the business, performance enterprise growing low single digits and the rest would be pretty much stable year-on-year. 
Stephen Milligan: And so we're kind of tying it back to the point that I was making earlier, as more and more of our business is deployed against non-PC applications, generally speaking, those are higher mix products, whether it be branded products, it be surveillance, it be on the enterprise space. So as our mix transitions from an overall business perspective, we're going to get a nice bump in terms of the average capacity point shipped. 
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. 
Joseph Wittine: Steve, you acknowledged hard drives will lose share within the PC category, and we've kind of seen that accelerate exiting the year. So kind of assuming your expectations of low single-digit declines for PCs, is the current trajectory in your client units, which is down 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis, is that a good kind of guesstimate or barometer going forward of what the trajectory will be? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, we expect -- well, we anticipate -- again, we'll see what Toshiba publishes, that we lost a little bit of share in the notebook space. And that was primarily because -- which has kind of happened over the last couple of quarters. Some of that may have a little bit to do with gaming and then also that's where margins tend to be lower. And so that may be some of the area where we just choose to not participate in some of the business. So I would say that, that decline is steeper than what the industry is seeing. 
Operator: The last question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. 
Jayson Noland: Steve, a question on the archive market. You've launched product that seems to be built specifically for that opportunity. Could you talk a little bit about traction there and what the potential is longer term? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, as I indicated in my remarks, we've got some, I hate to call it sample units, but we've got some customer applications running in test units and that kind of thing and positive response so far. Our customers are very pleased that we actually know how to construct a subsystem for them given that we've been a component supplier for so long. And so we're encouraged, and I think it's fair to say that our customers are encouraged as well with some of the progress that we're making in that area. 
Jayson Noland: And when you guys say you'll be moving up the enterprise stack, is this an example of that? And will some of that be more obvious down the road? Or is it just mostly going to be things that happen behind the scenes? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, this is an example of that. We're going to have to see how all of that evolves. And we will look at opportunities to intelligently move up the enterprise stack, and we'll do our best to do that, which we have done so far in a collaborative fashion with our customers. Our goal is not to compete with our customers but to figure out a better way of enabling them so that they can extend their value proposition to their customers, whether that be through other software services or other kind of offerings. So that's what our base strategy is. Any more questions? 
Operator: That was our last question. 
Stephen Milligan: All right. So thank you again for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution, and our customers for their continued business. Thanks so much. 
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital’s First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2015. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers’ responses to those offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results or expectations for the December quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 15, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation’s of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, sTec, VeloBit and Virident implied termination asset impairment and other charges and charges related to litigation. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. We ask participants to limit themselves today to a single question and one follow-up question during our Q&A section of the call. I also want to note the copies of remarks from this call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital’s website immediately following the conclusion of the call. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Stephen D. Milligan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter. Olivier joined Western Digital in early September as Chief Financial Officer. He is a welcome addition to our team, with many years of global finance experience, both at Amgen and Dell. I want to thank and acknowledge our former CFO, Tim Leyden for his 24 years of leadership and served us at Western Digital and we wish him the best and his retirement starting the first of the year. As anticipated market demand improved in the September quarter and we achieved strong revenue EPS and gross margin performance. We also continued to generate healthy cash flow. The diversified nature of our business, coupled with the ongoing secular growth in data, and our crisp execution continue to allow us to demonstrate strong and consistent financial performance, we expect this trend will continue. For the September quarter the industry CAM came in at the higher end of expectations. This reflected quarter-over-quarter growth and capacity enterprise, client, branded and consumer electronics and stable demand in performance enterprise. We saw the same trends in our own business, with notable strength in our client, capacity enterprise and flash platform solutions businesses. The ladder of which includes our expanding line up of enterprise class SSDs. The industry demand outlook for the December quarter reflects a modest sequential decline with moderation in client and CE partially offset by continued strength in capacity enterprise, and branded and steady demand in performance enterprise. We believe industry supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced. Looking at our business for the December quarter, we see the same trends. Moderation in client and CE, strong momentum in branded in capacity enterprise as well as in our flash related business, and continued steadiness in performance enterprise. As a company at the center of the storage industry, this is an exciting time for Western Digital. There is tremendous change underway and how and where value will be created. All around as the storage ecosystem is transforming with ongoing focus on how data is stored, accessed, protected and how it has been used and monetized. All of these changes are driving a diverse set of needs for our customers, and opportunities for our company. We are working with our customers and partners to help extract more and more value from data in an innovative and cost effective manner, across our full spectrum of products. I continue to be encouraged by our broad-based strategy both in terms of our financial results, and customer feedback. For instance, our flash platform solutions group resumed, as faster than an industry growth trajectory with revenue of $156 million for the September quarter. We remain on track to achieve accretive earnings for this business, early in calendar 2015. Our broad lineup of high capacity hard drives, based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform, has been very well received by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale datacenter customers, including the new 8 terabyte and 10 terabyte models announced last month. We recently shipped our one millionth WD Purple hard drive architected to address the high-growth space of security surveillance video applications. Governments’ and other large organizations’ increasing use of video and digital network cameras is driving a huge need for a high resolution recording. Our enterprise customers have responded very positively to our newly announced Active Archive offering from our newly formed Elastic Storage Group. And in the personal cloud, we continue to grow our My Cloud business with expansion in all geographies addressing consumer and prosumer markets. Olivier will now review our first quarter results and cover our outlook for the December quarter.
Olivier Leonetti: Thank you, Steve and delighted to be part of the team. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the September quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in July. In our business, we saw the anticipated seasonal increase in demand for client and branded products as well as strength in capacity enterprise and continued steady demand in performance enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our four to six week range. Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $156 million in revenue related to our Flash Platforms group, which includes enterprise SSDs. As a reminder, we continue to expect that our flash related revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the industry. We shipped a total of $64.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the seasonal improvement in client, branded and the strength in capacity enterprise. Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1% which was better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $39 million of amortization of intangibles. Operating expenses totaled $680 million. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $638 million, excluding $42 million of amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and employee termination costs. The additional expenses to our guidance primarily relates to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights. Our net income totaled $423 million or $1.76 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $504 million or $2.10 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, in our fourteen week quarter we generated $827 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $667 million. Our CapEx totaled $160 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $223 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share. We closed Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion of which approximately $1.2 billion was held in the U.S. I’ll now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. Gross margin to be flat with the December quarter level of 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles. A tax rate of approximately 8%, and a share count of approximately $238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.00 and $2.10 for the December quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today’s call. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank North America: Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could just go through the puts and takes on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter. I would think that the client business being may be at the softer you have better mix in the quarter. So I was just trying to understand that a bit better. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan: So if you look at Sherri. This is Steve. We’re going to take a small absorption had in terms of lower volumes that will be offset by favorable mix in terms of capacity enterprise and certainly we will see a little bit, client margins tend to be a little bit lower than the corporate as a general statement, but on balance things that net out to the extent that we think that our margins will be flat, quarter-on-quarter.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank North America: Okay, thanks Steve. That’s helpful. And then, it’s been a while since your last Analyst Day. I wanted to see if you could provide an update on your, on priorities for cash, in terms of how much you expect to use for buybacks and your plans to increase the dividend. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan: So, we continue to be committed to the capital allocation plan that we announced back in September 2012, in terms of 50% of our free cash-flow been returned to shareholders and the rest to be – I will call it held in reserve for potential strategic opportunities, as we look at the changes that we see in the storage ecosystem, we continue to think that there are opportunities for us to – I’ll say expand our footprint, in terms of the storage industry and ways that not only add value for our customers, but also add value for our shareholders. So at present, we are sticking with that capital allocation plan; of course we periodically review that, as a part of our overall review of our strategic priorities, but at this point there is no intend to change in our capital allocation plans.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah – Brean Capital: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the early solid quarter and Olivier welcome. I guess yes two if I could I guess both on kind of datacenter and cloud, so the SSD revenue was quite strong sequentially this quarter. Could you talk to – to what degree that was related to hyper scale build out, which you guys had talked to expecting and to what degree they’re related, I guess, OEM product refraction? And then I have a follow-up in that regard as well. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan:  So let me kind of opine in a broader picture. We are seeing broad based strength in terms of the broader enterprise business, both in terms of traditional customers as well as the hyperscale data center customers, both in terms of our capacity enterprise business, which we saw a nice pickup this past quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the December quarter and correspondingly we’re also seeing, as you indicated, strong strength in our enterprise SSD business. That is really, I’ll call it, across the board and really speaks to the strength of our product line both in terms of – well, really across the board, performance enterprise, capacity enterprise as well as in terms of enterprise SSD. We clearly have the broadest product line in the industry and not only that. We have the broadest products that we arguably believe that we got very strong performance from a product standpoint as well. So that’s being reflected in our performance as well as the build out that we’re continuing to see from the customer perspective.
Ananda Baruah – Brean Capital:  Steve, that’s really helpful context. I appreciate. And I guess just in that regard how are you guys thinking about the cadence of hyperscale deployments as we get into the first half of the year given there’s a lot of, I guess, call it lack of pent-up demand coming in the second half of year? And then also, how are you guys thinking about, I don’t know, the adoption kind of curve just in the enterprise, [tried and true] (ph) enterprise given that second half of the year is a heavy product cycle, second half with the OEM? Thanks. 
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. I mean we have, I’ll call it, increasing visibility. Obviously, we had good visibility till the December quarter probably in terms of what we see from a demand perspective. We got increasing visibility on what’s going to happen in the first part of 2015 and we believe that strength will continue from an industry perspective as well as from our perspective in the broader enterprise space through the first half of calendar 2015.
Ananda Baruah – Brean Capital:  Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple as well. So, first of all, I want to go a little bit deeper in terms of the portfolio difference between you and Seagate. I think one of the things that we’ve started this year is a pretty good adoption of your Helium drive. I think Seagate though had a very strong growth in their high capacity drives as well. Can you talk a little about the competitive landscape? What do you feel your share position is within these cloud and hyperscale guides? And then with that how you’re seeing the adoption rate pickup with regard to the Helium drives?
Stephen D. Milligan: We’re seeing strong momentum in terms of adoption of our Helium based drives not only in terms of 6 terabyte, but substantial interest in adoption of the 8 terabyte as well. And so, we feel very good about where we’re positioned particularly with the hyperscale guide, it’s a little bit more difficult to know exactly what our share position is? But we feel very comfortable with where we’re at from a customer and from a competitive product perspective recognizing the fact that Seagate is a formidable competitor, but we feel very good about where we’re positioned right now.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up, well, there is not a lot of questions right now with regard to MOFCOM. I think it’s still obviously an important variable to consider in the model. So maybe if you can give us an update where you stand with regard to the dialogue with MOFCOM and is there any kind of updated views on expectations with regard to the timing of a decision on MOFCOM and as you’re opinions or views change on a potential synergy opportunities being able to integrate Apache. Thank you.
Stephen D. Milligan: And so Aaron, no specific update that’s any different than what I provided last quarter, our dialogue with MOFCOM continues. It continues to be constructive and it continues to be active. And so I was in China a couple of weeks ago and met with MOFCOM. And as I indicated, we continue to have a discussion about our situation, the process that they will use from a review perspective. I’ll call parameters that they will use to evaluate our application. And so we although maybe a bit discouraged I guess you might say in terms of the timing. We are positive about our ongoing dialogue with China with the monopoly bureau. They have not provided any indication as to specific timing. I think one of the things that we have to recognize is that the whole separate remedy that was imposed was a new remedy. It was not something that they had done before. The reapplication to have it lifted is therefore by definition also a new process and an undefined process. And the Chinese are being very deliberate with that review. We respect that. And like I said, we may be a bit frustrated in terms of we certainly would like them to move faster, but at present we continue to be encouraged by the constructive nature of our dialogue.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open.
James Kisner – Jefferies Equity Research: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Helium, just wanted to understand if you had any capacity constraints and all were you able to meet all the demands for Helium drives?
Stephen D. Milligan: No capacity constraints related to our Helium-based drives.
James Kisner – Jefferies Equity Research: Great and just separately just mathematically there seems like you may be losing a little bit of share near-term on notebooks. Just could you comment on that as skepticism you’re seeing is this just a quarter-to-quarter duration or what you think?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, if you look at our share over the last several quarters, we have had the – we’ve sort of been up and down maybe a point or two. If you recall last quarter or two quarters ago, so the June quarter, we gained two points in market share, this quarter we lost, I believe, about 170 basis points. So this tends to be the normal ebb and flow that occurs in our business from a share perspective. And as was indicated yesterday on our largest competitors call, they took some incremental business or were provided some incremental business in the gaming segment that drove a reasonable amount from what we can gather of their share increase and correspondingly drove the Lion’s share of our market share decline. And also you can see that that was lower margins business and perpetuated itself and our respective financial performance.
James Kisner – Jefferies Equity Research: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is Richard Kugele with Needham Company. Your line is open
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: Thank you and good afternoon, just a couple of questions. I guess first is close the loop on the settlement with Seagate. I assume that that payment came from offshore cash right and is there any change to how you’re viewing your own capital deployment strategy to shareholders?
Stephen D. Milligan: So let me take this one. You’re right; the settlement was paid out of offshore cash. And as a clarification also we distributed 50% of our free cash flow this quarter which is consistent with what we have done over the last two years. Now in the short run, exiting the recent arbitration payment from our calculation, we reserved to not exceeding our capital allocation target. And we expect our board to view this matter next week during its regular meeting and we will update you at that time.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: Okay. And then actually in that vein, Olivier, how do you view the balance sheet and what do you think is the right type of cash balance to run the two operations as you move forward?
Olivier Leonetti:  It’s a question we’re asked a lot. As you can see in our balance sheet, our cash balances are strong with about $1.2 billion of cash in our U.S. bank accounts and also a leverage ratio, which is pretty low at 4.7%. As Steve indicated earlier, we believe that the current allocation, 50% of free cash flow is a good balance to reward our shareholders today, but to reward our shareholders tomorrow by keep investing in the business. So we believe where we’re today – we’re looking at that, but we believe it’s a balanced situation.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: Okay. And then just lastly geographically. The Americas took up nicely while Asia was down at a percentage of the total. And I’m just wondering if that’s tied into your enterprise strength as the U.S. data centers deploying a lot of high capital. Is that how we should view it?
Olivier Leonetti: That would be part of it and also it’s also a brand with strong – with a lot of that business being in the U.S. So in that regard there’s a bit of seasonality playing into it.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Next is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur – JP Morgan: Hi, good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. Your flash business obviously showed some nice acceleration here, up I think almost 40% sequentially, came in number one in SAS SSD. You’ve got a competitive PCIe offering. From a product perspective what’s driving the pickup series? Is it both staff and PCIe? Any color here would be appreciated. And maybe just a quick update on your SATA flash strategy.
Stephen D. Milligan:  Sure. So the primary momentum that we saw in our business was related to our SAS business, and primarily driven by a refreshed product line and we’re going to continue to see that momentum continue over the next few quarters. Relative to PCIe, we continue to be encouraged by that business. We have, as we indicated, had the HGST press event in September. We will have some refreshed products come out that we believe will be more competitive on the PCIe front and that will began to impact our financial results in the middle of next year. And then, right now on the SATA front, we do not have a competitive offering in that space. We’re looking at it closely and there it is primarily an economic issue. We clearly could address it from a technical capability and customer perspective, but we also want to do it in a way that generates direct kind of returns for ourselves and our shareholders.
Harlan Sur – JP Morgan: Thanks for that, Steve. And then as a follow-up the enterprise flash is a big market $4 billion. So obviously a lot of room for the team to go from here and as you scale this business higher, do you feel comfortable in being able to cost effectively secure NAND flash supply because it does look like suppliers are going to be fairly tight as we move through next year and potentially through 2016.
Stephen D. Milligan: At present we do. We continue to have a very strong relationship with Intel through our joint development arrangements. We’ve recently talked about how that development arrangement has been extended. I believe probably for – I may have my number here wrong, but I think it’s third time that we’ve extended that since. We originally entered into that arrangement back in 2008. We also announced back in September again at the HGST press event that we have expanded our NAND relationship to include Toshiba as well. So we’re working with them on a strategic basis as well. And we’ll continue to evaluate the nature of our relationships in that regard, but right now we feel very comfortable with where we’re at.
Harlan Sur – JP Morgan: Great, thanks Steve.
Operator: Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. If we look at even your Exabyte growth and even Seagate, but industry Exabyte is very strong in Q-over-Q. If we see similar trend in the disk drive industry, do you think industry could see tight situation over the next three to four quarters? And what will be the criteria if you were look at – if you’re willing add any new capacity?
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure, that’s something that we continue to watch closely. At present, we do not believe – well, I need to say this way, we believe that we will have adequate supply from a component perspective to meet anticipated demand, but you raised a very good point when you’re talking about these high capacity enterprise drives particularly our 7 Platters Helium-filled drive. We used a lot of components, I mean 14 heads and 7 in Platter. And so that is something that we’re watching very closely. But right now, we do not anticipate that there will be a problem in meeting customer demand and nor that we believe that there will be any meaningful need to add capacity that will materially impact our stated CapEx plans. Reminding you that relative to CapEx, we have indicated that as of right now we’re about 4% of revenue, we expect that that will continue at that level through the balance of this fiscal year.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities: Then a question on the hybrid side, Seagate kind of had a good – they shipped around three million hybrid client mainly in the quarter. Would you kind of consider the hybrid strategy at some point?
Stephen D. Milligan: No. We have a hybrid strategy, we continue to review it consistently. We are seeing some encouraging signs in that business, particularly in the client space. We are not from our perspective seeing much interest for hybrid based drives in the enterprise space. We think customers are interested in a disaggregated solution as supposed to an aggregated solution. And we’re going to continue to evaluate what we’re doing from a hybrid perspective, but don’t from a product perspective, from a performance perspective and from an economic perspective. We are bit more muted with regards to our enthusiasm as it relates to hybrid offerings.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Okay, okay, great, thank you. I wanted to ask about join technology partnerships, Seagate announced one recently with a cloud service provider in China, recognized you guys probably have these. But just have an announcement formally, how popular are these Steve and should we expect to see more of them going forward.
Stephen D. Milligan: The answer is yes. We should expect to see more partnership kind of activity. I don’t quite know how to dimension how popular they are. But with the ecosystem changing so much and it’s changing in some cases in ways that are harder to predict. I mean there’s a lot of evolving technologies. You’ve seen us make some, and these are smaller dollars within the whole grand scheme of things. Make some investments in some storage technology related companies, enter into other kinds of partnership arrangements. And so that kind of activity will undoubtedly increase. As we look to expand our footprint, expand the way that we can add value and clearly many of these companies given where we sit within the storage world the view us as attractive partners to work with as well. So I think that we will continue to see that kind of activity expanding for ourselves and for others in the industry.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Okay. A follow-up there on the financial model. As you head down that path expanding your footprint in the systems business, should that drive gross margin up and investment on the OpEx line up over time?
Stephen D. Milligan:  We are not specifically indicating that from a model perspective. I mean, we’re going to continue to keep an eye on that. We have been incrementally investing as well as reinvesting in terms of OpEx and shifting things around. But generally speaking, our OpEx levels have stayed relatively consistent from a percentage of revenue perspective. And then, in terms of gross margin, the opportunities that we are looking at pursuing, whether they be accretive on the gross margin line or accretive on the operating income line, I mean that’s clearly what we’re trying to do is figure out how we can add more value from a customer perspective and if we do our jobs right best to translate to improve the economics on our income statement as well.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Steve, you talked about the enterprise demand strengthening in the first half of 2015. How about traditional notebook and the consumer desktop? Any comment there and to that extent if you could also discuss the pricing trend that you see beyond the December quarter. Thank you. 
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. Relative to the PC market, both in terms of notebook and desktop, and I’ll address them together rather than individually. We see the PC market as I would characterize it as stable. We’ve seen in terms of IDC numbers that have been published or industry forecast that have been published is PC market declining in the low single-digits. We see that continuing. We don’t see either an acceleration or a deceleration from that perspective. So I would characterize the PC market as stable, which means that it’s certainly much better than it has been. And there’s certainly no slowdown or it’s not worsening and that’s a good thing from our perspective. Relative to the March quarter or the first half of 2015, I would indicate that our visibility there is not as great as it is in the enterprise market. And so, at this point, we would simply expect that we would see the normal seasonal decline that we traditionally see for a December quarter going into March, end of the first half of the year. So that’s the way we see it right now.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group: Great. And then any color on the pricing…
Stephen D. Milligan: Pricing has been within our expectation, nothing nearly notable to call out.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group: Got it, thank you.
Operator:  Rob Cihra with Evercore. Your line is open.
Rob Cihra – Evercore Partners:  Hi, thank you very much. I guess one – my question is a follow-up. On the enterprise SSD obviously a nice growth there. Do you had – I think Steve you’d reiterated the plan to be – or the goal to be accretive following sTec and the Virident acquisitions in early calendar 2015. That would imply I would assume that business moving to become meaningfully more of a contributor to the business given the fact that the HGST, Intel SaaS, SSD is still the bulk. I mean is that the case or is that more of a cost cut gets you to the equation. What gets you the equation, I assuming it’s…
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, so the primary dependency is ongoing revenue growth. We are investing a certain sum of money from an OpEx perspective to make sure that we have the product – the products out there from an industry perspective but the primary dependency is to that accretive statement is ongoing momentum from a customer acceptance and revenue perspective. And we are comfortable that we’re on the path that we need to be on to make the statement that we expect to be accretive on the first part of 2015.
Rob Cihra – Evercore Partners: Okay, great. And if I guess a quick follow-up on the Helium drives. I mean are they enough contributor yet to actually make a sort of meaningful impact on your ASPs on the blended ASP in enterprise. I am assuming so, but are they big enough yet to do that? Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan: I mean that really I would paint in the context that our capacity enterprise business was a meaningful contributor to our ASP lift in this past quarter. I don’t know if I want to call out the helium filled drives specifically, but it’s beginning to make certainly a much more meaningful impact. I mean we’re very pleased with where we’re at with the adoption of our helium platform. And not only that I’m very encouraged by customer reaction or anticipation to volume production in the 8 terabyte as well.
Rob Cihra – Evercore Partners: Right, thank you very much.
Operator: Mark Miller with Noble financial Capital. Your line is open.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets:  Well, thank you for taking my question. We talked earlier about the tightening NAND Flash environment possibility. And I’m just wondering at one point there was a big campaign for relative to competitors who have internal Flash supply as Flash prices increase?
Olivier Leonetti: I’m not sure I didn’t follow your question Mark.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets: Well, if the flash prices go up, I mean that’s a percent that you build materials for your drive and I’m just wondering what – how sensitive are you in terms of flash price increases, in term of your margins or your ability to transfer that to your customers?
Olivier Leonetti: Yes, I’m not that concerned about that market at this point. I mean we’ve been in the Enterprise SST business for a while, we’ve gone through some ups and down from a pricing perspective, we certainly have a history of dealing with that in terms of variability and in terms of component cost on our base drive business historically. There’s something that we have to watch and keep our eye on, but I’m comfortable that we’ll be able to deal with whatever variability exists from a component pricing perspective as it related to flash.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets: And just wondering it appears that you’re kind of projecting flat overall drag kind of for next year is that same reason of all?
Olivier Leonetti: We haven’t provided a specific forecast for next year stand. What we have indicated is that we expect the TAM for rotating magnetic storage to increase at a low-single digits level from an unit perspective.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets: And I apologize for this extra but just a housekeeping question, what was your forecast for SG&A and R&D for next quarter spending?
Olivier Leonetti: As we said – as I said in my remarks about $600 million.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets: $600 million so that’s down significantly from this current quarter, is that correct?
Olivier Leonetti: Correct for two reasons we had one addition week of OpEx last quarter, we had 14 week. And then the other one off incentive payment as well.
Mark Miller – Noble Financial Capital Markets: Okay. I’ve Mr. – the incentive payment. Thank you.
Olivier Leonetti: No problem.
Operator: Ben Reitzes with Barclay’s. Your line is open.
Benjamin Alexander Reitzes – Barclays Capital Inc.: Hi, thanks a lot. Steve I wanted to ask you kind of a little more new arms around two things, you already touched on it. In terms of the December quarter guidance with the loss of the extra week, your guidance looks pretty flat up actually if I were to assume that its probably impossible to know what the extra week gave you in the quarter but if you take something off it looks pretty flattish and you were saying down. So I just wanted to see what the extra week was in your guidance and then I just had a quick follow-up?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes Ben you are right it’s a little bit difficult to calibrate exactly what the impact of the extra week was last quarter. Also not to further confuse things, the December quarter is always a little bit tricky. In the sense that you have Christmas and how much activity actually takes place in the last week. So you could argue that at the 12-week quarter in the sense in terms of the December quarter. The reality of things is that most of our business is reliance shares, OEM based on and such not as transactional. So I don’t really think that the 14th week had a material impact for us we do believe that is probably slightly accretive if we were to guesstimate, but talking about December quarter I mean there will be some moderations from an overall demand perspective that we think that the demand environment as on balance. It’s pretty good. It’s not great, certainly not bad. But it continues to be generally relatively steady.
Benjamin Alexander Reitzes – Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay, great. And then I just open you could clarify one other thing that you said around 50% of free cash flow billing to shareholders and the other 50% joining reserve for potential opportunities. I was just wondering if you could hold that comment around potential opportunities. Did you mean more on the enterprise and flat side or do you if there is a way to holding that I mean it’s really hard to say what you are going to go out and buy into, but if you are the specific, do you see it more in consumer enterprise or however you want to specify that would be great. Thanks.
Stephen D. Milligan: There are two principle opportunities that we think where we our position from a product and customer perspective to expand our footprint. One, I’m clearly as in the enterprise space. If you want to call that moving us to stock and a way that is complementary to what many of our – what much of our customers are doing. And also, we do think that we have incremental opportunity in the consumer or prosumer or smaller, medium business opportunities from a storage perspective as well. So that’s would be the two principle areas that we would be focusing on.
Benjamin Alexander Reitzes – Barclays Capital Inc.:  Great, thanks so much. 
Stephen D. Milligan:  So thank you again for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in both our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers' responses to our product offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the September quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 5, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during the call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident, asset impairment and other charges and charges related to litigation. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note the copies of remarks from today's call by Steve Milligan and Tim Leyden will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Stephen D. Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. Western Digital achieved strong financial results in the June quarter, with better-than-anticipated revenue, healthy gross margin performance and continued strong cash flow generation. We achieved these results by addressing continued robust demand in gaming and better-than-anticipated demand in notebook PCs, demonstrating our flexibility and capability in high-volume businesses. We also saw strength in our performance enterprise business. We anticipate better demand in the second half of the calendar year as we benefit from an improving demand profile for PCs, as well as from growth in the capacity enterprise space. Our recent dialog with leading PC makers has been uniformly positive, and we are also encouraged by our ongoing interactions with data center customers. Longer term, we remain excited about Western Digital's strong strategic position at the center of the storage ecosystem, which continues to expand, evolve and transform. The creation of digital data continues unabated, and the strategic value of that content is increasing. With our deep insight and experience, we will continue to play a vital role in unlocking the value of data with innovative and industry-leading storage devices and solutions. We will continue to focus our investments in the highest growth areas: the public cloud and enterprise data centers, mobility and the personal cloud. Along those lines, I am pleased to note several recent achievements by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, including the expansion of our industry-leading Enterprise SAS SSD portfolio with our next-generation Ultrastar drives with capacities up to 1.6 terabytes; a new converged enterprise PCIe product roadmap following the integration of our sTec, Virident and VeloBit acquisitions; shipment of our next-generation 10K and 15K 2.5-inch performance enterprise hard drives; shipment of our third-generation WD Red product at 6 terabytes to address continued strong demand in the home and small business mass space; continued global success of our WD Purple drives in addressing the high-growth demand for security surveillance in homes and offices; and the introduction of My Book Live Duo, the newest member of our award-winning line of desktop storage solutions for the home and office, with software that provides secure local cloud and system-level backups for complete data protection. Collectively, these developments highlight our broad-based participation in the growth of data. Combined with our ongoing investments, I'm confident of Western Digital's future as a leading technology company and storage solution provider. Tim?
Timothy M. Leyden: Thank you, Steve. Strong demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the June quarter. Continued strength in the gaming space, better-than-expected demand in notebook PCs and strength in performance enterprise countered the anticipated softness in capacity enterprise. Revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $15.1 billion, including $509 million from Enterprise SSD, which represented a 43% increase from fiscal year 2013. We continued to make progress on our journey towards a more diversified revenue mix, with 53% of our revenue coming from our branded consumer electronics and Enterprise HDD and SSD businesses. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion, including $113 million from Enterprise SSDs. Over the long term, we continue to expect that our SSD revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the total Enterprise SSD space. We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $56. The quarter-over-quarter decline in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the robust gaming and better-than-expected notebook volumes. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.5%, in line with our implied guidance and excluding $39 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $10 million of other charges. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $317 million or $1.32 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $445 million or $1.85 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $713 million in cash from operations in the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $552 million. For fiscal year 2014, we generated $2.8 billion in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. Our CapEx for the June quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. For the full fiscal year, our CapEx totaled $628 million, again, 4% of revenue. We expect that CapEx for the 2015 fiscal year will be at or below the low end of our 5% to 7% model. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $272 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 10.3 million shares for $816 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share. In total, we paid dividends of $259 million during fiscal year 2014. We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was in the U.S. I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion; gross margin marginally above the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of around $625 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the 14th week adds about $28 million of OpEx; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 241 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. In closing, I want to remind investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 would consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks and the second and third and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So first question for me would be just as we look at the 14-week period in the current quarter, I know you talked about operating expenses. So maybe you can help us understand what's your total TAM assumption for the industry and then also, what are you assuming as far as the contribution for your shipment numbers for that extra week in the current quarter. And I do have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Aaron, it's Steve. We -- our TAM expectation for calendar Q3 or fiscal Q1 for us is around 145 million units, kind of in that range. And we would expect that the 14th week, when you look at it on a net basis or an operating income basis, it will be modestly positive from an earnings perspective from our standpoint.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-on, I know that -- I don't know if you're going to say much at all, but just any kind of update of where we stand as far as the refiling with MOFCOM? Any kind of clarity or any expectations or any color that you can give would be helpful there.
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. Just to comment on where we're at and to refresh everybody's memory, in March of this year, we were able to reapply to MOFCOM to request that they lift the whole separate restriction on our business. That application process and review process, which MOFCOM is ongoing and continues, I don't have anything specific to comment on in terms of the status other than to comment that our dialog remains frequent with them and is constructive. And in that regard, we feel good about the direction that we're headed in terms of the dialog we're having.
Operator: Next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I also had 2 questions. Tim, perhaps if I could start with you though. If you could talk a little bit about the cash cycle. The DSOs were up quite a bit, and so your cash conversion cycle weakened significantly relative to past June quarters. If you could just talk a little bit about what drove that and where you see that going here in the current quarter. And then I have a follow-up please.
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes. I'm not sure that we can significantly -- on a cash conversion cycle basis, it was up 1 day.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Yes, sorry, the DSO is what I was referring to, excuse me.
Timothy M. Leyden: We made some progress on inventory, particularly in [indiscernible] -- we funded finished goods a bit. As far as the DSOs are concerned, that was mainly due to customer and channel mix. As you know, in the fourth quarter, it's historically been our weakest quarter, particularly for consumer and distribution and retail. So consequently, it's mainly due to just customer mix.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay, okay. If I could ask my follow-up then. As it relates to pricing, could you talk about like-for-like pricing? And particularly, how you see how it was this quarter and how you see it unfolding in the September quarter please.
Timothy M. Leyden: Just a bit of background, the -- as you know, our -- the TAM was quite a bit up from where we had anticipated in our April call. And mostly, it was up in notebook and in gaming, which we've indicated historically that those are among our weakest ASPs and our weakest margins. And so pricing continues to be competitive, and there was about 60% of the delta between the 2 quarters in ASP, which was a $2 delta came from the mix and the rest of it came from price and from like-for-like pricing.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. Well, I would assume to follow that the pricing mix would be favorable as we looked at the September quarter.
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes. In the September quarter, again, there's a more favorable consumer mix as we head into the holiday season. So consequently, we're expecting that it will be modestly -- there will be modestly upward momentum in the pricing in the September quarter.
Operator: Next question is from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Two if I could. The first one -- both bigger picture. The first one is with more hybrid drives being qualified as we head into the second half of the year, what is your thinking around '15 and '16 in the potential to maybe gain back or claw back some of the share that SSDs has gained in notebooks over the last few years? Love to get your thoughts there and then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. This is Steve, I'll take that question. Relative to hybrids, first thing is, is that it remains a relatively small piece of our business or low volumes from our perspective. We began to see some encouraging signs from our perspective in terms of the acceptance or utilization of hybrid drives, albeit small, still remaining small volumes. So we should see increasing volumes as we move through the back half of the year. I think it's a little bit too early to say how much that will stem the acceptance of pure -- of SSDs in the PC space. I think it's just a little bit too early to call that. We'll have to see how some of these new products that our customers are introducing, how they are received in the end-user market.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful, Steve. And as a follow-up, just with regard to the CapEx model and the comments, you said in fiscal '15, you plan to be below the low end of the 5% to 7%. What -- how should we think about your thinking with regards to moving back up into that model over the next handful of years, next couple of years and the timing of needing to add add on capacity, save TAM space stays flattish to slightly up? And how might you go about looking to finance the capacity add-ons?
Stephen D. Milligan: Right now, we continue to expect that we'll stay kind of at or below that, the 5% to 7% range. The one wildcard, frankly, that we have is what happens relative to the hold separate situation. If the hold separate gets lifted, we will then be able to rationalize our capacity across both subsidiaries, which undoubtedly would allow us to minimize capital expenditures going forward, at least for some period of rationalization. Now if that doesn't happen, we'll have to evaluate. But right now, we feel pretty good about where we're at from an overall capacity perspective. Really, the only thing that we're adding from a pure capacity perspective relates to either test capacity or some SSD activity. So I think right now, for the near future, we're going to continue to stay at that, the low end of that range or low end or below.
Operator: The next question that I'm showing comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: A question on visibility. Steve, you mentioned expectations for better capacity enterprise into the second half. How has that conversation changed over the last few months?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, it's getting increasingly more positive, I guess is maybe the way to say it. I mean, one, order rates are improving, and also, the signaling that we're getting from our customers continues to be increasing or improving. So it's not -- I wouldn't characterize it as a step-function improvement in terms of volume, but we're seeing a nice steady gradual improvement in demand both in terms of actual orders booked as well as in sentiment as we move to the back half of the year.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then a similar question on visibility from PC OEMs. Has that firmed up a bit also?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, definitely. I would say that the visibility that we're seeing from a PC manufacturing perspective arguably is the best we've seen in quite a while. I would anticipate that we will continue to see strength in the PC market through the balance of 2014, and we are increasingly optimistic that, that will carry in at least in terms of the first half of 2015.
Operator: Next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions. I wanted to dive a little deeper on the SSD front. I saw you launched a new version of the Enterprise SSD that you had acquired from sTec. Can you just talk about the road map there now that you seem to be progressing with some of the products they have? Is that considered the next generation controller, for example? And then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Rich, just to clarify, the product that we recently announced is actually a Ultrastar product that is related to the -- our joint development arrangement with Intel. What we have done is unified our road map or rationalized the combined road map between sTec, Virident and HGST. We have a single road map going forward. You will continue to see new product introductions coming out from us on that front, again, as we move to the back half of the year, and we are getting -- we continue to be increasingly optimistic about the road map and the products that we'll be introducing in that space. One other thing to add to that, you saw that this past quarter, our revenue was lower in the SSD space versus prior quarters. If you recall, for the last 2 quarters, we had indicated that we were in a sole-source situation. That customer has now multi-sourced that product so we're seeing our revenue, if you want to call it, normalized, as a result of that. We will -- we expect to see revenue expansion on a quarter-on-quarter basis as we move through the back half of this year and obviously, into 2015 as well.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So this is the trough for the SSD side?
Stephen D. Milligan: That's right, Rich.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then on the drive side, you also announced the 6 terabyte that was non-Helium so presumably, that's shingle. But can you just talk about your view of areal density and if you think we can get consistently back above 20% over the next 12 to 18 months?
Stephen D. Milligan: Areal density advances will continue to be modest, whether it's in that 20% kind of a range. Until we get to some advanced technologies, and that's really an industry statement, we feel comfortable with where we're at as a company from a competitive technology perspective. And the 6 terabyte product that was recently introduced, 5-Platter, which is clearly leading areal density point, is oriented towards the NAS market. So it's not -- just to clarify, and it's not oriented towards the enterprise market, but more towards the NAS market.
Operator: Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Can you talk a little bit about the performance enterprise? What was behind that strength that you saw? And I do have a follow-up as well.
Stephen D. Milligan: Relative to performance enterprise, just 2 things really to comment on. One, we saw a bit of improved demand from a overall sort of industry perspective. I don't think that there's anything specific to call out that was driving that, just in general, a little bit more strength from an overall industry TAM perspective. More importantly, as it relates to our numbers, is that we saw particular strength as we continued to refresh and build out our product line in the performance enterprise space, and I think that customer acceptance of those products and the capabilities of those products is reflected in our -- in the numbers that we published today.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Okay. And then I want to revisit lots of color on the PC OEM conversations, which is really great. But can you actually get into what is behind that uniformly positive discussion? Is it more than just temporal enterprise tailwind from the XT end of service?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, there's certainly 2 things, in particular, that we're seeing. One is, is that the commercial PC market on a relative basis continues to be stronger than consumer. Albeit, I mean let's be frank, PCs were still flat to slightly down. But we're seeing an improving demand profile in the commercial space, which undoubtedly have to do with a Windows refresh cycle there. The thing that, frankly from my perspective, was probably the most encouraging is that we're beginning to see, let's call it, initial signs of strength in the consumer space or maybe the beginnings of some strength. If you look at the latest data that was published, the rate of decline in the consumer PC space is declining. And now certainly, it's coming off of more favorable compares, but we are beginning to see some initial encouraging signs in terms of commercial PC demand. Now why that's the case? I'm not sure that we know for sure. Arguably, there may be -- there's a lot of PCs out there that haven't been upgraded for a while. And people, rather than, let's say, call it tablets fatigue or what have you, they're diverting dollars that may have previously gone to other devices to finally upgrading their PCs. And so maybe some encouraging news, and we're optimistic that it will continue certainly through 2014, and we're getting more encouraged it will carry into 2015 as well.
Operator: Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: Two questions for me. First of all, if we look at the revenue growth for the year, it was obviously down slightly. Your markets had been tough, but seems to be turning. I'm thinking back to 2 years ago when you had an Analyst Meeting and talked about sort of like a 4% type of growth for the company as a whole, top line. I was curious if we can revisit that and maybe talk about your comfort level around that as a secular trend if some of these markets do show some more modest recovery. And then I had a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. I think that the major change that we've seen since -- jeez, when was that when we had the Analyst Day, a couple of years ago, is that we've seen -- we saw a more severe contraction in terms of the PC market. It's probably the principal thing that we saw. Maybe some other changes in terms of other markets, but I think the biggest driver of that was PCs. I mean, right now, if we were to call the TAM, we would say that we'd be looking at maybe flattish to slightly small single-digits increases. With -- given that we're moving to a richer mix underneath those numbers, maybe modest single-digit revenue increase. That is still with pretty, if you want to call it, conservative. I mean, we still have to continue to see how sustainable the PC market is from a longer-term perspective. And so -- but as we see more encouraging signs in the PC market, we may adjust that, but I think that's kind of where we're at right now.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: I appreciate that color. And then just, Steve, one follow-up on what you mentioned with the PCIe roadmap. Can you sort of qualitatively talk about how all these acquisitions are coming together and sort of time frame for maybe seeing something public that we could start to understand how far along you are?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. I mean I think it's certainly, this quarter, we'll have some things that we'll talk about, and some things we'll continue into the end of the year in terms of new product introductions. We'll get more visibility on that. And not only that, I think that we'll begin to see some more meaningful, I'll call it, revenue accretion from the acquisitions. And again, as Tim indicated in his prepared remarks, we are on course to have those acquisitions be accretive in the first part of 2015. So I would say that on balance, the acquisitions are tracking to our expectations.
Operator: Next is Rob Cihra with Evercore.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I wonder if I could just get a little bit more into sort of the pricing and competitive dynamics in the market. And if you look at the quarter, you guys gained some shares sequentially, and I realize there's some mix elements in there, including gaming, of course, that's probably transient. But I just want to -- if you see market share shifts, in some sense it seems positive, but then sort of the pessimistic side of you says, "Oh God, if market share is missing around, that means that pricing is more competitive or that there's any kind of competitive posturing going on." I mean, do you see any of that working its way into the market, given that we really haven't -- we've had awfully good market for the past couple of years? Or am I being too cautious, and is this simply just a quarter-to-quarter movement based on mix and that sort of thing?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. Rob, I can certainly appreciate the concern. I think that if you look at what happened -- I mean, that is not what happened. There was not any particular pricing dynamics that drove those share shifts. We've talked about this before. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, share can move around 1 point or 2 depending upon the circumstances. Clearly, the areas that -- we went into the quarter anticipating that we would gain share because, we, for frankly a number of years, have had a particular strength with the gaming customers, and seasonally, we knew that, that was going to be particularly strong in calendar Q2. Then -- so that was no surprise to us and was expected. I think the thing that, if you want to call it, surprised us was notebook PCs were stronger than what we expected. Through both of our subsidiaries, we have a strong position in that market, and given our model, and I would say that at some level, advantaged margin structure, we were able to take advantage of that maybe a little bit easier than other guys, but it wasn't because of any particular pricing dynamics.
Operator: Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: I think I wanted to ask on the guidance here. Just to clarify, does it include a full 14th week of sales? Because I guess, if it does, implied seasonality is down a few points, at least, at the midpoint. And within that, if you could address the seasonal trends by your different buckets on a sequential basis, that would help.
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes, it does include the 14th week of sales. Now it's pretty hard to identify how much of it is a difference versus what would normally be a 13-week because, as you know, with the way that the dynamics of the quarters go, generally, there's a fairly strong 13th week and then the first week of the following quarter, it tends to be driven by outside factors, by customer behavior, et cetera. So consequently, it's hard for us to figure out exactly how much we've taken a shot at it, obviously. We're up 7% to 8%. It does include the anticipated uplift that we would get as well. Coming after the weaker June quarter, we would anticipate in normal circumstances -- even in a 13th-week situation, we'd expect some low single-digit increase from the June quarter through the September quarter and then some element of full week that we've loaded in for the beginning of the 1st week of the new quarter, which now becomes our 14th week. And as Steve has indicated, I don't -- we're moving up from somewhere around $138 million or so to around $145 million, but we -- in those numbers, we have anticipated the 14th.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, that's really helpful. And can you just briefly address on a pure organic basis how you see the individual segments trending on a unit basis into September if excluding the additional week?
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes, we expect that gaming will stay strong. We expect that notebook will continue to retain its strength. We expect retail, in particular, to be seasonally strong, and we're also expecting some level of comeback in capacity enterprise, and we're expecting performance enterprise to continue its strength as well.
Stephen D. Milligan: Just to make it real simple, basically, we're expecting reasonable growth, which means that we're seeing reasonable strength in all segments, except for gaming. Not that we're not seeing strength in gaming, but gaming from a TAM perspective will would be roughly flat. Everything else should be up a bit.
Operator: Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Two questions for me. One, I was wondering, Tim, if you could just touch on the cash conversion cycle. It sort of crept up pretty steadily over the last several years. And I'm curious, I mean, you have this target of 4 to 8 days. What does it take for you guys to get there? Is it the approval of MOFCOM? Or can you get there the way the structure is today?
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes. Well, our 4 to 8 days is really pre-acquisition model, which is more for a client business rather than enterprise business. And we've held off from revising it because of the fact that since we're operating 2 separate businesses, it's -- it could be a wasted effort until we managed to get over the challenges on efficiency that we have from MOFCOM. So it's something that we're watching, something that we're really paying attention to. I think we've got opportunity in inventory in particular, although we are funding inventory, funding finished goods in order to improve our cost and also in order to buy capital expenditure because we're trying to operate linearly so that we don't have to deal with spikes and have equipment and all the needless spikes. And we're also trying to be cognizant of the challenges in the supply chain. So we're also trying to have a friendlier approach towards the DPOs as well. But we've got a high mix from an enterprise viewpoint, and from a regional viewpoint, we've got a high mix of OEM customers, and that does put a little bit of a cramp on the DSOs.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And as a follow-on, I was wondering if you'd touch on the 6 terabyte Helium-based drive that you guys have for enterprise market. I believe Seagate has a comparable 6 terabyte drive not based on Helium. But are you seeing a better adoption of these high-capacity drives, especially entering the back half, given the fact that customers now have a dual-source option in that space?
Stephen D. Milligan: The first thing is that I would say is that the introduction of our 6 terabyte Helium-filled drive really 2 things: One, it has been well received in the marketplace; and two, it is meeting our expectations from a volume perspective. The second thing that I would say, which we've talked about before, is that the 6 terabyte product that we introduced was principally, I will call it, a technology demonstration. And what -- not that it's not a real product. I don't want to imply that, but we -- from a customer perspective, we want to say, "Look, this is a platform that we are introducing that we want you to get comfortable with." We will continue to introduce follow-on products from a Helium-filled perspective that we believe will be very competitive in the marketplace, and we also believe will drive further increases from a volume perspective. So the 6 terabyte product was not an end-all to be-all so to speak.
Operator: Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Given the incremental units in revenue in the September quarter from the 14th week, does that create a flat to down sequential trend in December? Do you think the industry can still grow sequentially even though your comp-ing that 14th week? And then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. Katy, I think that's a very good question. I think it's a little bit too early to call, but if we were to look at it today, we would probably see a decrease going into calendar Q4. If nothing else, really 2 things. One, seasonality has shifted over time. Q4 is not as strong as it used to be. People are putting things on boats to save in terms of transportation cost and those kind of things. And also, the 14th -- going from a 14th week to a 13th week will impact our volumes. And so at this point, we would expect that we would be down going into calendar Q4. The question is, is how much, and that -- it's too early to call that.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then given the strong outlook for the September quarter, better visibility among PC OEMs, why not step up the share buyback, given you're running at higher cash levels versus your peer?
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes. I mean, it's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. We're currently pursuing the plan that we outlined in the -- September 2012 at the Investor Day. And we recently -- actually twice in the past year, we increased the dividend, but we're continuing to execute on the plan for 50% of free cash flow. And we've fallen -- sometimes, it gone a little ahead of us, sometimes, we've fallen behind. And this last quarter, we did actually above 62% or so of free cash flow. But it's something we evaluate on an ongoing basis. It was a pretty big change for us as a company. So consequently, it's something that we'll do on a measured basis, but it's not -- but it's something that's on the radar screen all the time.
Operator: Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: The first question is if you look at the last quarter, you had talked about some inventive addition like at some of the cloud customers, and then rearchitecting of systems and enterprise customers. You just -- you have talked about that you expect kind of a strength in that quarter-to-quarter, but could you maybe talk more qualitatively the demand trends you're seeing from your cloud customers?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. I think from a cloud customer perspective, we -- it ties in the comment I made earlier. We are continuing to see the order flow and the sentiment of our customers improve somewhat gradually. Again, it's not a step-function kind of an increase, but we believe that we're going to continue to see an improving demand profile as we move through the back half of the year. And so some of the issues that we talked about last quarter on our call, those have been resolved and sorted out, and we're looking at a more favorable demand environment.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: And the last one for me, the Xyratex acquisition is -- kind of grows. So could you maybe talk about if you are seeing any impact on the share in the enterprise market because of that acquisition by the Seagate or regarding the test equipment support from Teradyne or from Xyratex?
Stephen D. Milligan: There's been no impact related to that. Well, thank you very much for joining us today and for your interest in Western Digital. I would like to close by thanking our employees worldwide for their dedication and performance throughout fiscal 2014 and our shareholders for their continued support. We look forward to keeping you informed of our future progress. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2014. [Operator instructions.] Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and storage ecosystem, stabilization of demand in our business, demand trends in the enterprise space, our product offerings and our customers’ responses to our product offerings, and our financial performance, including our financial results and expectations for the June quarter.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 31, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during the call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.  The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident; asset impairment and other charges; charges related to litigation; and expense due to the writeoff of debt issuance costs. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question in our Q&A session. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor's section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I’d now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital Steve Milligan.
Steve Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. We achieved solid financial results for the March quarter, with revenue in line with our expectations and gross margin and earnings per share exceeding our guidance. Cash generation remained strong. Our steady financial performance continues to demonstrate an ability to manage the business and deliver ongoing value to our customers and shareholders. Both of our subsidiaries executed well in the March quarter, as we continue to participate in the ongoing growth of data with an intense focus on helping our customers succeed in a rapidly changing environment. Our results reflect sustained strength in gaming, anticipated seasonality in client and branded products, and some softness in the enterprise space. The industry TAM was slightly higher than anticipated, driven by the strength in gaming. We continue to see demand stabilizing in the commercial side of our client business as part of a PC refresh cycle, and we remain positive about the long term demand trends in the enterprise space. The continued strength in gaming is due to consumers’ healthy demand for the newest game console designs, all of which have integrated hard drives. Overall, we believe industry supply and demand remain in balance.  We continue to believe very excited about our unique position in the overall storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on the dramatic changes that are underway. Customers are responding positively to a number of new products and technologies we are bringing to market to help them to be successful. Specifically, our enterprise class SSD business had another strong quarter. We will continue to expand our full range of enterprise SSD products, including SAS, PCIe, and SATA, in a range of form factors and capacity points, as well as grow our software and solution offerings. Several strategic OEM customers have qualified our 6 TB helium filled drive, and we are shipping to them in volume. The product is generally available on a global basis, resulting in broad adoption in all geographies. It is important to note that our innovative helium technology platform is extendable to higher capacities and additional applications.  We recently began shipping a new family of highest-performance, high capacity 2.5 inch 15K hard drives. Our customers continue to use 15K hard drives with SSDs in tiered pools of storage, and this new product addresses the industry’s shift away from the 3.5 inch form factor to smaller 2.5 inch drives to help manage space requirements. Customers have responded very positively to our Power of Choice lineup of hard drives, including the WD Red drives that ship primarily to value-added resellers who are configuring mass systems for small and medium businesses. Likewise, the new WD Purple series addresses security surveillance mass systems for the home and small businesses. Both of these are high-growth segments where storage is a value-added means to an end for the customer, which makes them attractive opportunities for us. We continue to see opportunities with our My Cloud network attached storage solutions in the home and small office segment. Our My Cloud solution provides the opportunity to connect with billions of devices that create, store, and display massive amounts of data. All of these products reflect our highly focused strategy of helping our customers succeed through collaboration and innovation and are contributing to the favorable mix shift underway in our business to higher growth and higher value-added segments of the market. Before turning it over to Tim, I wanted to address the topic of our discussions with China’s Ministry of Commerce. Consistent with our prior commentary, we had the opportunity to submit a request in March for MofCom to lift the hold separate restrictions on our business. We have done so and we continue to work with MofCom as they review our submission. In the meantime, we continue to operate our HGST and WD subsidiaries separately and we will keep you informed of any material developments.  Tim?
Timothy Leyden: Thank you, Steve. Our March quarter performance reflected healthy unit demand and solid execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 137 million units during the March quarter, which was higher than the TAM implied in the guidance we provided in January. In our business, we saw continued strength in gaming, anticipated seasonal declines in client and branded products, and some softness in enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our 4 to 6 week range. Our revenue for the March quarter was $3.7 billion, including $134 million from enterprise SSDs. Our enterprise SSD revenue was slightly better than we had expected, and some of the single source strengths we saw in the December quarter carried into the March quarter. We continue to expect that our SSD enterprise business will outpace the market’s revenue growth rate over the long term. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 60.4 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter over quarter decline in overall ASP was primarily driven by business mix.  Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Excluding $39 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, as well as $16 million of restructuring charges, our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 60 basis points, primarily due to operational efficiencies and better utilization. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $628 million for the March quarter. SG&A included the following items: $11 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, and $4 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $8 million of restructuring charges. We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the March quarter relating to the Seagate arbitration matter.  Tax expense for the March quarter was $31 million or, or 8% of pretax income. Net interest expense for the March quarter was $13 million, and included $4 million of debt issuance costs that were expensed with the payoff of the prior credit facility. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $375 million or $1.55 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $470 million or $1.94 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $697 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $536 million. Our capex for the March quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.8 million shares for $244 million during the March quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share. We entered Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $5 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion was in the U.S. I’ll now provide our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down and in a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion; gross margin approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending around $600 million, also excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8%; a share count of approximately 242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.65 and $1.75, for the June quarter, which includes the dilution impact of approximately $0.10 of the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit, and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015.  Overall, we continue to execute well, and we are well-positioned to succeed in the evolving storage market. In closing, I want to point out to investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 will consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks, and the second, third, and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel: First question would be on the enterprise relative weakness. Maybe you can help us understand how the quarter progressed, where maybe in particular you saw the weakness, be it between the traditional enterprise guys, relative to the cloud vendors, and then how we should anticipate that business looking into the current quarter. 
Stephen Milligan: The primary area where we saw a bit of weakness in terms of enterprise demand was in capacity enterprise. Not so much traditional performance enterprise in terms of our business. That more or less tracked to our expectations. I think just to kind of put a little bit of context on this, one of the things to keep in mind as a general statement is that one, the volumes for capacity enterprise on a relative basis are not that large in terms of relative to the total TAM.  The other thing is that the number of customers, it tends to be dominated by a relatively few number of customers. So any changes in purchasing behavior on the part of some of those larger customers can have a relatively significant impact on the overall numbers. So that’s just a little bit of context. With that being said, basically what we saw was increased efficiency from the standpoint of some of our significant hyperscale buyers. And efficiency is coming in the form of really a few things. One, supply chain efficiencies and efficiencies in the way that they deploy capacity from their standpoint through their deployments, and also, in terms of improved utilization, in terms of the overall storage capacity.  So they’re basically working off inventory that they already had in place, because of, if you want to call it, inefficiencies in their deployments. We see that persisting through our current quarter that we’re in, our fiscal Q4, and we expect that demand will pick up in the second half of the year, more in line with what we’ve been seeing in the past. And so it’s a short term dynamic in terms of the first and the second calendar quarter of this year, and we don’t expect to persist longer term.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel : And as a follow up real quickly, I know you’re not giving any updated thoughts around MofCom, but as we look at your business model and look at the utilization rates of your manufacturing, can you help us understand where you stand utilization wise, be it internal versus external on heads and media, and maybe how much opportunity exists to driving more efficiency or utilization out of those key assets?
Stephen Milligan : I’ll take a stab at that and then Tim can add to that as appropriate. First off, we’re very comfortable right now in terms of where we’re at with our internal versus external component purchases, really, on both subs. And frankly, they’re at relatively consistent levels, coincidentally, not through any inappropriate coordination. They just happened to be at very similar levels in terms of the percentage of internal versus external components for both heads and media. And generally speaking, that’s been fairly consistent over the last few quarters, so we haven’t seen any material change in that. From an overall utilization perspective and expected synergies that we might happen to realize if we are able to combine, we have not provided a specific number on that in terms of cost synergies. We have provided an indication of what we thought it would be on the opex side, but needless to say, it will be meaningful in terms of the reduction in terms of cost that we’ll see on our cost of goods sold if we’re able to combine the two entities. And so clearly we think that will be a benefit, not only to our shareholders, but in particular to our customers, and will allow us to continue to fund the required innovations that we need to deal with the changing storage ecosystem that we’re dealing with.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. 
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Just geographically, Asia was up, EMEA was down. Can you just put any color around that? And then I’ve got a follow up.
Timothy Leyden: It was at the noise level, really. There was some movement in there, but it was relatively insignificant. So there wasn’t anything really that was significant that would cause us to call it out separately.
Stephen Milligan : One thing that I would call out is that obviously we saw strength in the gaming side of our business. That is all attributable to Asia. Because it’s shipped into location, as opposed to where those ultimate systems get deployed. And so that might have something to do with that increase in Asia.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : And as a follow up, would you have a similar level of optimism for the second half of the calendar year as your primary competitor, both the PC client side as well as the hyperscale guys, coming back in ordering? I think you commented a little bit about that, but any other color you might have?
Stephen Milligan : In terms of the second half of the year, we are optimistic about the enterprise side of the business, and so in that regard, I would say that we would concur with what our largest competitor has said.  On the PC side, and Rich, you know us well, we probably tend to be a little bit more cautious and a little bit more conservative. We have definitely seen a stabilization in the PC market. Now, it still is declining on a year on year basis. Certainly a lot of that has to do with commercial refresh. The question there is that we don’t know how long the sustainability of that commercial refresh.  We believe that we’ll continue to see some of that activity through the June quarter. The question is, does it persist through the back half of the year. Consumer generally speaking, as far as we can tell, continues to be relatively weak, so we’re not really seeing any particular strength there.  So I would characterize that we’re probably cautiously optimistic regarding PC demand trends, but I think the stabilization is meaningful in the sense that there’s less volatility. And that decreased volatility just makes it a little bit easier for us to manage and plan around that as opposed to chasing the ball around on the pitch trying to figure out which way it’s going to go next.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : And just lastly, on ASPs, given the gaming mix, which is presumably a much lower ASP, that going down here in this June quarter, would you expect ASPs to be more firm this quarter, maybe even increase? What should we be expecting here for June?
Timothy Leyden : They’ll be flattish.
Stephen Milligan : Yeah, we’re going to continue to see pretty strong gaming volumes here in the current quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. 
Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray: Just another follow up on the PC side. So it looks like both notebooks and desktop units underperformed relative to Seagate this quarter. The results are still in line with your normal 10% decline in calendar Q1, so was there anything abnormal in those segments that you noticed regarding pricing or share shift?
Stephen Milligan : I wouldn’t call anything out specifically from our standpoint. The client business from our perspective - and this is kind of at the margins, so it’s not a significant thing - was a little bit stronger than what we expected. Gaming was certainly stronger than what we expected, and then the enterprise side, which I talked about earlier in terms of capacity enterprise, was a bit weaker.  But the stronger PC business that we saw, it was not that significant within the whole grand scheme of things. And competitive behavior was within the norm, I guess you might say. We didn’t see any unusual competitive behavior that would be particularly alarming to us.
Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : And then if you look at it from a region perspective, were there any large differences between your mature markets and your emerging markets?
Timothy Leyden : I think the consumer business is a bit more impacted by the macroeconomic issues, and as you know, the emerging markets have been challenged really because of the foreign exchange. And so that continues, and we’re seeing that the more mature markets are the stronger ones, and the emerging markets are the weaker ones. And of course the dislocation in Russia didn’t help.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. 
Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners: On the enterprise SSD side, you’re saying you’re still looking to be accretive from the sTec and Virident acquisitions early calendar 2015. I guess can you just help map out at all - maybe not specifically map out, although it would be awesome - where that’s revenue driven versus cost cutting driven or cost savings driven? Is it all revenue driven, or is it just hopefully like a smooth ramp from here? Or are there kind of milestones that we can be looking for more specifically?
Timothy Leyden : I think it’s a continuing plan. We’re putting together the multiple roadmaps for sTec, Virident, VeloBit, and the JDA. And as we put those together, we will have some efficiencies that will come from cost. We’ll obviously be building up our revenue.  So from where we are right now going towards the end of the year, by the time that we’re exiting December, we will be pretty much at breakeven, or maybe a little bit accretive. And then we’ll be fully accretive in the first quarter. And it will taper between now and then going from the $0.10 to where we are right now, towards that breakeven point in the December quarter, as we exit December. 
Stephen Milligan : Just to add to that, the primary driver is revenue and ramping the new businesses. And the new business being those products that relate to the sTec and Virident acquisition. There are some synergies or rationalization from an opex perspective, but the primary driver will be continuing to ramp from a product perspective, from a revenue perspective, from a customer perspective, those new businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : You were pretty clear on the drivers of the enterprise weakness, particularly within the hyperscale customer base. But could you give us some color on the demand trends you’re seeing within capacity enterprise for traditional server and array OEMs? And how are you thinking about that as we progress through the calendar year?
Stephen Milligan : I don’t know if I would really call anything out, frankly, in terms of that. I mean, it’s a little bit of a challenging question in the sense that we have a number of customers that increasingly are coming more and more direct to the [drive] guys, which is obviously impacting some of the traditional customer base.  And so I don’t think we saw anything in particular that stands out with our traditional customer base in the capacity enterprise market that’s worthy of calling out, other than just ongoing challenges of how to remain relevant with some of the changing purchasing behaviors on behalf of some of our customers. 
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : And then you had mentioned that you would extend your helium platform to other product lines over time. Can you remind us of how we should think about what this does to your cost structure relative to the competition now and particularly over time as the technology matures?
Stephen Milligan : You mean our cost structure? Or our customer’s cost structure?
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs :
 :
Stephen Milligan : Well, the primary impact to our cost structure, which has nothing to do per se with helium, the fact that it’s helium sealed, is that as we are shipping higher and higher capacity drives, whether they be 6 or 8 or 10 or whatever it happens to be as the product extends itself over a period of time, is the test times for these products are significant. And so we’re having to add, or will have to add, as volumes ramp, meaningful amounts of test capacity. But that is not unique per se to the helium platform. It just has to do with the amount of data these things are storing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monica Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities : The first question is on the enterprise SSD side. Could you maybe talk about do you think in the next quarter you’ll see enterprise demand to be flattish or decline before you see it pick up, as you talked about, in the back half of the year?
Timothy Leyden : Each of the different segments, other than gaming, is likely to be down as you look quarter on quarter.
Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities : And the other question I have is on the enterprise SSD. If I look at your June 2013 enterprise revenues, they were about $104 million. And if I add sTec, which was only at about $25 million a quarter, and then you add Virident, VeloBit, and kind of one-time benefit, it seems that revenue is still flattish. Maybe could you talk about kind of when do you expect the pickup in that segment?
Stephen Milligan : I think you’ve got to keep in mind that relative to the sTec side, the momentum there was not exactly positive. So I think you’ve got to consider that really we bought a, I hate to call it this, but a little bit of a distressed asset.
Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities : And just a last one on the Xyratex, you were talking recently about the test times increasing on the enterprise side. So maybe can you talk about with Seagate buying Xyratex, does that impact your test strategy somewhat? And kind of how do you see the relationship with the test manufacturers?
Stephen Milligan : We are generally comfortable with where we’re at in terms of our relationship with our test equipment suppliers, including with Xyratex/Seagate. There are contractual provisions that were put in place prior to the closing of that transaction that we believe sufficiently protect us, and will provide for a constructive relationship going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: How were you able to keep gross margins flat in the March quarter given lower volume, lower ASP, and the mix shift away from enterprise to gaming? Was there anything one-time or are whatever positive benefits you saw continuing into the next few quarters?
Stephen Milligan : You know, I want to remain appropriately humble in terms of answering this question, but the reality is that we have a really good team, particularly from a manufacturing perspective, from a cost perspective, on both sides, being WD and HGST, and they are constantly working on eking out every dollar of savings that we can. And so it’s just a matter of sort of scratching and crawling every day, to make sure that we’re realizing appropriate efficiencies and it shows up in our numbers. That being said, overall, even though the volumes came in the form of, let’s say, gaming primarily, in terms of upside, which didn’t necessarily translate to higher ASPs and that sort of thing, we did get some additional efficiencies from higher volumes that provided some of that uplift as well. But frankly, I have to take my hat off to our operations team in terms of their ability to grind out cost savings all the time.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley : So that should continue?
Stephen Milligan : I certainly hope so.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley : And then just lastly, do you need the $2.5 billion of net cash? And what’s holding you back from stepping up on the buyback, given fairly constructive comments about second half of the calendar year?
Timothy Leyden : We continue to pursue the plan that we outlined in September of 2012, at our analyst day, which is 50% of free cash flow. But obviously as we go forward, we’re in the business of making sure that we maximize the value for the shareholders. So consequently, we are always looking to see what’s best mix, and what’s the best balance between investing in the business for future gain and also making sure that we meet our obligations that we have outlined to shareholders. So it’s an ongoing process that we’re looking at, and we continue to look at it. But we’re very pleased with the generation of the cash flow and obviously we keep looking at it.
Stephen Milligan : I think another comment to make, and not to in any way message that we have anything planned, but one of the things that we think is important is that we continue to keep our powder dry in terms of looking at additional opportunities, whether that be M&A or otherwise.  There are a lot of dramatic changes going on in the storage world, in the data world. We believe we’ve got our eyes and ears to the ground in terms of trying to understand what’s happening, where we’ can add value from a customer perspective, what we can do from a technology perspective. And so we want to make sure that we’ve got sufficient stock, so to speak, for any other opportunities that might be M&A related. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital : I guess the first one is a question with part clarification. Did I hear correctly that the expectations for blended ASP is to be flat sequentially in the June quarter? And if that’s the case, I guess in the context of the revenue guidance, which is down 5% quarter over quarter, that would sort of put it all on the TAM is the implication, that you’re expecting TAM of $130 million in the June quarter? 
Timothy Leyden : Yes, we did indicate that the ASP would be flattish, and in line with the seasonality that we’ve historically seen, generally it’s down somewhere in the region of about 4% or so from a quarter over quarter basis. So that’s really where the expectation and the matching of the flat ASP and the revenue guidance is coming from.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital : And then the follow up is with regard to gross margin. I guess given that there’s sort of similar revenue decline in the June quarter relative to the December quarter, and the mix isn’t tremendously changing, why wouldn’t you be able to capture similar efficiencies? Steve, to your comment, hopefully they continue in the June quarter. And why couldn’t margins be more flattish? Or is the volume, the down sequential TAM, really that big of an impact?
Timothy Leyden : Yeah, there would be a little bit of a challenge as far as utilization is concerned, when you compare quarter on quarter. So that’s really where the challenge is. From a viewpoint of component reductions, what we’ve seen is that as the volumes stabilize, the component cost reductions have also flattened out a bit, and they’re not as significant as they used to be historically. They’re probably running somewhere in the region of about a half to a third of where they had been previously. So consequently, the utilization takes on a larger significance in that particular mix. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox - Cross Research : Just getting back to the SSD business, I guess on a year over year basis, including inorganic activity, you were up 45%. Can you sort of flip that to what kind of organic growth the business is experiencing year on year, and maybe some more color around what was driving it in the most recent quarter? And then sort of expectations for the rest of the year? And then I have a quick follow up.
Timothy Leyden : There’s a lot of moving parts, and you’ve got SAS and SATA and PCIe, all as [unintelligible]. From what we can glean out of it, it looks like on a year on year basis, that the growth is somewhere north of about 50% or so. So we’re just slightly behind where the total market growth rate is. 
Steven Fox - Cross Research : And in terms of your own success, is there anything you would point to that’s having a better impact on the market than maybe some of your competitors? Because obviously that’s a significant business for you guys.
Stephen Milligan : I don’t know if I would call anything out in particular. I think that in a lot of ways, we were, I’ll call it an early investor in this business, going back to really 2008. And this is on the HGST side initially. And that also corresponds to a lot of the work that we did to improve our position in the broader enterprise market period, and have really developed what we’d like to believe are very tight relationships with a number of enterprise customers, and have broad-based knowledge of the enterprise market and the interaction of storage devices with systems and so on. And that’s bearing fruit. And the added credibility that we happen to provide, it may not be entirely showing up in the numbers as of yet. There is some ramp, and not only that, ongoing product development that we need to do. But that credibility will translate to either legacy sTec products, which basically will go away. I mean, call it HGST products going forward, and then not only that, it will translate to PCIe or Virident related products as well. So I think it’s really just a reflection of our ongoing investments in credibility in the broader enterprise market.
Steven Fox - Cross Research : And then just one real quick question. I know you’re not providing guidance on the second half of the calendar year, but there has been some talk about a return to normal seasonality. If that was sort of a baseline, are there any markets where you feel like you could see that come back? I know you expressed some conservatism around PCs, but is there anything where you feel like you could get a seasonal lift at least, if we’re looking at the model second half of the calendar year?
Stephen Milligan : I think the one area that we would call out, and I don’t know if it will necessarily be outside of seasonal norms, it’s probably a little bit too early to call that, but obviously we’re expecting a nice rebound in terms of capacity enterprise demand. So there might be a little bit more strength in that market than what we traditionally have seen. And so that’s the indicators that we’re getting “today”. We’ll have to continue to validate that as we move through the balance of the quarter. And then we’ll talk more about that when we have our earnings call in three months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : First off, could you talk about the enterprise pricing trends, both with the web sale companies as well as your traditional enterprise companies? It seems like pricing’s been a bit more aggressive as of late. And that would include the near lines. If you could talk about current pricing trends, and then talk about what you see pricing trends over the next couple of quarters.
Stephen Milligan : The one thing that’s tricky about the enterprise space as an overall comment, is that the margins are richer. And that’s traditionally been the case for quite a long time. Therefore, there’s more margin to give away, just by definition. These are indicative numbers as opposed to real numbers, but if you’re running 20% gross margins, there’s not as much profit to give away, and so people are going to be more cautious. When you’ve got higher margin products, and you think that there is an opportunity to drive elasticity, you might be compelled to lower those prices more than you otherwise would. And so as a general statement, I would say that probably in the enterprise space, as we begin to see weakness - this is an overall statement, it’s not a statement about us. I’m not pointing the finger. It’s not anything like that. It’s not intended that way.  But, you know, people weren’t entirely sure what was going on from a demand perspective. Maybe there was a little bit of a thought, well, maybe there’s elasticity here. So we’re going to maybe look a little bit more at the pricing lever and maybe things got a little bit more aggressive than what made sense. Because there was not the kind of elasticity that you normally would expect. And so I think that’s kind of maybe what’s happened over the last few quarters. Going forward, the reality of it is that pricing is always difficult to predict. It just is. And obvious statement, but no one individual or no one individual company controls pricing. And there’s a lot of factors that go into that.  The market continues to be competitive, and we are working very closely with all of our customers to find different ways to continue to help them solve the issues that they’re working on to help them create value, whether that be through innovative products, innovative technology, and also making sure that the products are at a cost point for them that makes sense depending upon the economics that they’re trying to drive in their business.  So there’s a lot of dynamics that go into pricing, but I do think that given the larger margin pool, it’s a little bit more tempting for guys who look at taking price down than maybe other segments of the market.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : And my follow up is related to TAM. And I’d like to follow up on Ananda’s question. The seasonal guide for June is a little less than seasonal, and I think [unintelligible] Seagate and WD, that’s what it would suggest. What is driving that? Is it the hangover from [SV], or is it the enterprise [near line drive] that’s causing a little less seasonal in June? And [unintelligible] part of the question is, Seagate talked last night about 140 to 145 for the back half of the year. Is that kind of a range you’re comfortable with in the September and December quarters? [unintelligible]
Stephen Milligan : We’re forecasting revenue generally down 4% on a quarter over quarter basis. That, from our perspective, is pretty consistent with normal seasonality. And so I would not intend that that’s outside of the norms of what we’ve seen historically. And overall, I don’t think that we’re really seeing any particular dynamics in a given market, other than the gaming market continues to be healthy. That’s just a good thing in terms of volume absorption and that kind of thing. So that’s kind of helping us a bit. So I wouldn’t really call [anything out] there. And then what was the second part of your question? I’m sorry.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : The 140 to 145 range in the second half of the year for the TAM. Does that feel reasonable?
Stephen Milligan : I’d prefer not to go there, honestly. I think it’s a little bit too early. We’re certainly expecting a seasonal uptick in our business in the back half of the year. There’s still a fair amount of uncertainty out there, and I don’t want that to come across as an overly negative statement.  It’s more just to be cautious, and that’s kind of the way that we manage our business. There is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty out there. What’s really happening in the PC market? How long is this refresh cycle going to have?  And I’m afraid of saying all this, because I’ll scare everybody. You know, there’s a fair amount of geopolitical things out there. China is still kind of soft overall. Russia provides a little bit of uncertainty, how’s that going to play out.  And I think it’s just a little bit too early to call exactly how calendar Q3 and Q4 are going to look, other than we think we’re reasonably comfortable that it’s going to be seasonally up, pretty much along the lines of what we typically see.
Operator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: One, maybe if you could just touch on the inventory side. A healthy spike in the finished goods inventory on a sequential basis. Could you talk about what’s driving that given the fact that you’re actually looking for a downtick in TAM in the June quarter?
Timothy Leyden : So if you look at our business, and look at the cash flow, we had very good linearity during the course of the quarter. And we used that linearity in order to be able to avoid capital expenditure. Because it means that we’re able to avoid spikes. So that’s one thing. The second thing is, we’re putting quite a lot of product on the ocean, and from a funding viewpoint, and from an investing viewpoint, and from a return on investment, that is proving to be a very good ROI. We did take something in the region of about $60 million in absolute terms out of the work in process, and our [raw] was almost flat.  So when we look at how we’re executing the business, it’s a mix of making sure that, as we kind of bypass an expenditure through linearity, we can then avoid costs through putting product on the ocean. And as we put it on the ocean, it means that we carry that inventory for something in the region of six to eight weeks or so. So it does have an impact on our finished goods. 
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : And then a second question, I guess when I look at the total exabytes shipped on a capacity basis, it looks like that number is about 10% both year over year and also on a rolling four quarter basis. That seems to be below kind of what the expectation is, at least I would have had on that number. So how do we think about that as we go into the back half, especially when you’re expecting this enterprise pick up. Does it remain here? Or do you think it gets back to this 20% to 30% range.
Stephen Milligan : So there’s a few things that are impacting that. The first thing that I think is important is that overall growth in data, which is a little bit difficult to get exact numbers on it, but [unintelligible] the analysis that we’ve got is tracking to our expectations. So it’s not an issue, the exabyte growth issue is not reflective of overall content creation, if you want to call it that. The other thing is that some of the numbers that we have been talking about historically, let’s call it a 25% growth, rounding off to 25% growth, in exabyte volumes. That had certain assumptions related to the PC market, both from a volume perspective as well as from a capacity mix perspective.  What we’re seeing is one, volumes have generally speaking been less than what we had previously assumed. The other thing is that our PC customers are not mixing up to higher capacity points as much as we normally have seen. Really, one, because they’re trying to hit certain cost points, and also, aerial density growth is not progressing as much as what we have historically seen. So that, because of the large volume that the PC market tends to have, has an oversized impact on that 25%, reconciling it back to the 10% number that you’re talking about.  And then on the last factor that I will cite, is that some of these recent changes that we’ve seen in terms of the capacity enterprise market, where we’re seeing more softness than what we previously expected, because of efficiencies that they’re realizing, that’s also had an impact. And we would expect to see that that will begin to improve in the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: I just wanted to get some of your thoughts on M&A. You mentioned M&A as a possible use of cash going forward. Obviously you’ve been doing a lot of stuff on the SSD side, but would you look at things like moving up the stack into the storage stack, like Seagate has done with the Xyratex acquisition? 
Stephen Milligan : As a general statement, not necessarily speculating on would we do something exactly like what Seagate’s done, but we will continue to look at ways that we can add value throughout the enterprise stack. So it may or may not perpetuate itself potentially as exactly with Xyratex’s acquisition, but yes, that is certainly an area where we’re working with our customers and have active dialog in terms of well, what are different ways that we could add value? And there’s nothing conclusive there. But that is a meaningful opportunity for us from a business perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: First, on the hybrid side, you’ve talked about that as being a 2014 story for WD. Can you maybe give us an update on how you’re thinking about that market develop? And then secondly, I’m sorry to keep hitting on the enterprise side, but how much visibility do you have when the capacity guys are coming to you with forecasts? How comfortable are you with looking out with that. You know, I’m asking that around the context of you’re expecting a second half increase, but it’s been a pretty disappointing segment all in all over a few quarters, or some would even argue a year. So just wondering if you could sort of help us understand that dynamic.
Stephen Milligan : On the hybrid side, frankly it hasn’t been as compelling of a product, or has not tracked to our original expectations. And I think that is not only a WD statement, but is also frankly largely an industry statement. One of the things that we’re continuing to focus on is trying to figure out how that value equation translates or sells, not only with our customers, who in this case would be traditional PC OEMs, but also to the end customer. 
 : Now, to be honest, our revenue expectations were not that significant anyway, and so it doesn’t have that significant of an impact on our financial results, but it is something that we need to continue to focus on and make decisions on going forward, particularly in terms of investment otherwise. On the enterprise side, what’s actually happening, to address your question in terms of visibility, what was going on before is that our enterprise customers, or capacity enterprise customers, particularly the hyperscale ones, were either carrying more inventory than they needed, or we were carrying inventory for them, because they didn’t have as much visibility, and so their supply lines or deployment schedules were kind of inefficient.  What’s happened is that they’ve become more efficient, which is actually, other than the short term demand driver that we’ve seen, good for our business in the sense that we believe, and this is something that needs to be tested out as we move forward, that there’s going to be improved visibility, less inventory carried through the entire supply line, and that will be good for our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. 
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird : Just a follow up to that last topic, Steve. How much does new product, 6 TB and helium, play into elongated test and [unintelligible] cycle? Does that create a pause at all? I wasn’t sure if that was included in your remarks about efficiency. 
Stephen Milligan : Are you talking about a pause in terms of demand?
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird : That’s right, a quarter or two of delay as those buyers get their arms around how to deploy the product.
Stephen Milligan : Not so much. I mean, maybe at the margins, but not that significantly. It’s still relatively low volume within the whole grand scheme of things. And it’s being worked in in terms of a normal deployment schedule. And frankly, we’ve been talking to our customers about the 6 TB and when it was going to come out for a while, so it’s been worked into their planning cycle. So I wouldn’t say that there’s anything particularly unusual related to that that’s impacting the number of units that our customers are pulling from us in the capacity enterprise space.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird : And as a follow up, on the branded, down with seasonality, as expected. I think there’s a media push there. Are you happy so far with what you see in the network attached personal cloud market?
Stephen Milligan : Yes, we are.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird : Any additional color on the opportunity?
Stephen Milligan : Well, we think it’s a great opportunity for us. We’re going to have to continue to invest. We’re going to have to continue to make the product more and more compelling, I’ll call it from a software perspective. And so it has been a good product for us. We’ve had some service issues. We’ve addressed those. We’re investing in that. We’ve got to make sure that we deliver on the product offering that we’re putting out there. But the initial reactions to it have been very positive. It’s serving a purpose, filling a market need. And so we’re very excited about it, but we’ve also got more work to do in terms of continuing to make the product compelling as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. 
Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research: I’d like to follow up a little bit more on the branded side. It looks like the revenue and units were both down year over year, as well as ASPs. Can you walk through why you’re seeing this trend, especially in the context of the My Cloud seems to be getting good traction here?
Timothy Leyden : As we’ve gone through the years, there’s been more of a concentration on 2.5 inch versus 3.5 inch, and 3.5 inch does have higher price. So from a mix viewpoint, there is an increasing percentage of the total is 2.5 versus 3.5, and that contributes to the dampening of the price. That’s mainly what causes that.
Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research : And can you talk about why you actually saw the year over year declines on the revenue and units?
Timothy Leyden : I don’t think that the growth numbers have been as we would have expected, and I’m talking about total TAM. So consequently, we participated in that. And Toshiba has taken a bit more market share in some parts of the world, primarily through aggressive pricing. And we’re selective in how we compete in there, but the market growth we expect is going to get back as the products become more compelling. What we’ve done is participated selectively and tried to keep the market share that we’ve had.
Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research : Taking into account Toshiba’s aggressiveness, then do you see that the TAM for branded has been expanding for the March quarter? Or was that flat, or could that still contract?
Timothy Leyden : We think there’s a lot of opportunity for external drive attachment as we go forward, particularly as handheld devices and other devices don’t have that much storage integrated into them. So it’s a changing market, but there are lots of opportunities there, and together with direct attach, NAS, and also wireless, I think there’s big opportunity for us to be able to capitalize on the continuing trend towards mobility. But so far, I think it’s been more anemic that we would have expected or liked it to be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joe Wittine - Longbow Research: I wanted to ask about gaming. How long does the cycle go? Initially, I think you’d assume you get an initial uptick with the early adopters, then kind of ease. And I think at one point, we said September would be the peak, and December held up, March held up. It sounds like June will be okay. So going forward, does the cycle play out with a long runway, or can this market potentially change on a dime and see orders pulled abruptly if things slow quickly?
Stephen Milligan : That’s a very good question, and the reality is, I don’t know the answer to that. And part of the reason I don’t know the answer to that is because our customers don’t know at this point. I mean, the demand has been very strong. There’s a lot of bullishness there. And so we don’t know exactly how long the cycle is going to go. Now, that being said, just as an example, the models will last for quite a while. It’s just units will continue to be produced. It’s just a matter of at what volume. And so we’re going to have to continue to monitor that and keep you abreast of how we’re seeing the gaming volumes play out. But right now, there is a fair amount of bullishness on behalf of our customers regarding the new gaming consoles.
Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : And then finally, on the My Cloud, you kind of talked around this, Steve, but the service outages. Do you think you kind of nipped it in the bud quick enough where there’s no near term market dynamics that shake out because of it?
Stephen Milligan : We haven’t seen anything regarding that. It has apparently not had any impact on our sales. That being said, we take these things very seriously, and certainly did our best to respond as quickly as we can, and have attempted to take preventative actions to minimize the risk of that happening again. But so far, knock on wood, we have not seen any direct impact on the units that we’re selling. Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward. Thank you very much.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-01-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. 
 Now, I will turn the call over to Bob Blair. You may begin, sir. 
Bob Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among others, our participation in the growth and our role in the future of digital data, our position in the storage ecosystem, customer response to our product offerings, trends in the global economy and PC market, investments in the enterprise markets and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the March quarter. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 29, 2013, and in our registration Form S-3 filed with the SEC on October 30, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.
 In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident; employee termination benefits and other charges; and charges related to litigation. Because of the amount of these items -- because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.  
 I also want to mention that we're aware that there's been some technical issue with accessing our investor summary posted on our investor website. And that's in the process right now of being addressed and taken care of. [Operator Instructions] 
 I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor Section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. 
 I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan. 
Stephen Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our December quarter results and our outlook for the March quarter.
 We executed well in the December quarter, as we continued to participate in the ongoing growth of data in all of our served markets. The industry TAM was slightly higher than anticipated, driven by seasonal demand. We saw strength in gaming and branded products. We exceeded our expectations on revenue, gross margin and earnings per share in the December quarter, and our cash generation remains strong. The consistency in our financial performance reflects the reduced volatility in our business. 
 We continue to be very excited about our unique position in the storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on the dramatic changes that are underway. We serve very large markets, underpinned by strong data growth prospects. It is clear to us that most of the world's data will be stored on hard drives and enterprise-class, solid-state drives in tiered architectures, as companies and consumers seek to optimize performance. 
 Strategically, we are well-positioned to play a leadership role by innovating and collaborating with our customers to define the future digital data landscape. Total exabytes shipped and average gigabytes per drive continue to grow, reflecting strong customer response to our enterprise and branded products. These are 2 growing businesses where we have established leadership positions. Continued success in these markets offers us the opportunity to achieve even better financial results over time as we add more and more value to our solutions. As data becomes more strategic in the enterprise, companies are investing differently in IT infrastructure, looking to achieve optimal total cost of ownership. This is resulting in more fragmented solutions, allowing for more customization and value creation by storage providers. These trends are helping to drive the upward trajectory in our cloud-related revenue.
 Over the last few months, customers have responded positively to 2 of our newest products addressing the demand for innovative solutions in the personal, public and private clouds. Specifically, we launched the WD My Cloud, a comprehensive personal cloud solution for users to organize, centralize and secure their digital content and access it from anywhere in the world. This is an important element of our Connected Life initiative to improve the connectivity of the home. We launched our 6 terabyte helium-based sealed drive, which leverages our proprietary technology platform called HelioSeal. Select strategic customers have already qualified the drive, and we are shipping the product. 
 We have also seen continued customer preference for our portfolio of enterprise-class, solid-state drives. In the December quarter, our SSD enterprise revenue outpaced the growth rate in the overall SSD enterprise market, as we continue to integrate our recently acquired talent and technology into the HGST SSD organization. 
 We are excited about the year ahead, tempered by the industry's usual seasonality in the first half of the year. We see several potential drivers for a better demand environment, including prospects for an improving global economy, a stabilizing PC market and ongoing investment in both the traditional and capacity enterprise markets. 
 I will now turn the call over to Tim Leyden. 
Timothy Leyden: Thank you, Steve. Our strong December quarter performance benefited from solid market demand, favorable channel and business mix, and continuing good execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 142 million units during the December quarter, up from the September quarter and the year-ago period, and the TAM came in slightly higher than the guidance we gave on our October call. In our business, we saw strength in gaming, consistent quarter-over-quarter performance in client and enterprise, and the anticipated seasonal pickup in branded products.
 Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean. Our revenue for the December quarter was $4 billion, including $155 million from Enterprise SSDs. While we expect our Enterprise SSD revenue growth rate to continue to exceed that of the industry, the upward trajectory in the December quarter was especially strong, given a single-source opportunity. Overall, 54% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick in branded products and strength in distribution. 
 Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%, excluding $40 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $15 million of restructuring charges. We exceeded our implied guidance from non-GAAP gross margin by 30 basis points, primarily due to favorable business mix.
 R&D and SG&A spending totaled $650 million for the December quarter. SG&A included the following items: $12 million of charges related to certain litigation; $11 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets; and $6 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $5 million of restructuring charges. As a reminder, the previous period included a flood-related insurance recovery of $65 million.
 We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the December quarter relating to the Seagate arbitration matter. Tax expense for the December quarter was $37 million or 8% of pretax income. Our net income for the December quarter totaled $430 million or $1.77 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $532 million or $2.19 per share.
 Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $727 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $557 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $170 million or 4% of revenue. As part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2 million shares for $150 million during the December quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share. We exited Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which approximately $700 million was in the U.S.
 I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down and in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion, reflecting the seasonally lower TAM; gross margin approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles, reflecting the impact of lower factory utilization due to lower volumes; r&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8%; and a share count of approximately 243 million. 
 Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.80 and $1.90 for the March quarter, which includes a dilution impact of $0.10 from the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. 
 Overall we are pleased with our continued strong performance. We are enthusiastic about our prospects to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market. 
 Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: How would you characterize the compute in enterprise markets versus your original expectations in December? And then can you just talk about, in each of those segments, what you think seasonality will look like in the first quarter? And you mentioned potential upticks as the economies improve. When would you expect to see the better seasonality off of the macro recovery? 
Stephen Milligan: Sure, Katy. A couple of comments, in terms of the quarter, the past quarter, so calendar Q4, for the most part, it really kind of played out to the way that we expected it. Enterprise really sort of came in, both in terms of performance enterprise and capacity enterprise, more or less turned out the way that we expected it. Where we saw a little bit more strength was the notebook business, or 2.5-inch client business was maybe a bit stronger than what we expected it to be. The -- also, the gaming market, gaming business was certainly stronger than what we expected. The new gaming consoles appear to be -- consumers appear to be responding to them very favorably. That's encouraging to us. We're glad to see that. And again, I think the branded products business was seasonally stronger. And so, really, things played out very consistently to our expectation, with a bit more strength in gaming and a bit more strength in the notebook business. Now, in terms of how things are going to play out in 2014, a little bit hard to say, frankly. One of the things that we're seeing right now, because we haven't seen it frankly for several years, is we're seeing seasonality return a bit. If you go back in time, we've had various things that have impacted seasonality. We've had earthquake in Japan, we've had floods in Thailand, we've had other kinds of situations that have maybe masked, from our perspective, traditional seasonality in our business. So if you look at this quarter, the March quarter, PCs traditionally are down about 10%. So we're looking at a TAM reduction probably in the 5% to 7%, maybe 8% level. One of the things that is making things a little bit difficult from a clarity perspective is that Chinese New Year is a bit earlier this year. So what we're seeing some of our customers do in the PC space is do a bit of build ahead in anticipation of the Chinese New Year shutdown, and then we'll have to see how demand picks up after that. So that's just a bit of color in terms of what we're seeing from a demand environment perspective. 
Kathryn Huberty: And then just as a follow-up, there was margin upside this quarter, even without enterprise upside. What would it take to get margins up into the 30% to 32% sustainably? What do you need to see over the next 4 quarters for that type of margin upside? 
Stephen Milligan: To answer that question in kind of a generic way, what we're going to have to continue to do, which is really what we're really trying to do all the time, is continue to add more value from a customer perspective. And we do think that as we do that, there's an opportunity for us to see our margins creep up a bit. I mean, that's really what we've been doing. Obviously, we're going to continue to do the things that historically we've done, which I'll call it the normal blocking -- blocking and tackling, managing our mix, managing our costs effectively. And so -- but really what we've got to do is continue to add more value from a product perspective. The other thing is, is that specifically as it relates to our Enterprise SSD business and some of the acquisitions that we made there, we need to continue to ramp those, which is coming along nicely. And as we do that and as we see that become a more material part of our business, that should contribute favorably to our gross margin structure going forward. 
Operator: Next question comes, from Rich Kugele with Needham. 
Richard Kugele: Just a few questions for me. I guess, first, let's talk about the SSD side a little bit. Do you see the operating structure of the now combined entity appropriately sized and the accretion that's in early calendar '15 is driven by just revenue growth? Or do you have some operational changes that you're trying to make as well? Just trying to understand the puts and takes that get you from here, with $0.10 dilution, to the accretion. 
Stephen Milligan: Rich, I think there's a couple of different factors. I mean one, we're still in the process of making sure that we optimize the organization, both from a pure headcount perspective, as well as making sure that we've got the right mix of employees. And so that process is ongoing. We'll continue to do that. But the main thing that we need to do in order to realize that accretion in 2015, is continue to ramp our revenue appropriately with the appropriate product set. 
Richard Kugele: Okay. And then secondly, just looking at, obviously, Xyratex is taken out by Seagate. Can you just comment on your view of testers and your relationship with Teradyne? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So, really, a couple of things. It's a little bit hard to respond to that specifically at this point, Rich, because Seagate has, to my knowledge, made no specific comments externally in terms of what their plans are with the Xyratex organization, and more specifically, as it relates to their tester business. That being said, we're obviously looking at various different ways that we can manage any potential impact that might occur related to that transaction, and part of it has to do with our relationship with Teradyne. 
Richard Kugele: Certainty, I guess then, from your manufacturing footprint today, you feel comfortable you have enough flexibility in your testing capacity? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. 
Richard Kugele: And then lastly, because I've been asked the question, any disruptions from the unrest in Thailand? I know you guys have been there a very, very long time and have seen these things from time to time. But, just because I've been asked. 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. And no disruption. And we're obviously monitoring the situation very, very closely. Our -- one of our primary things is to continue to make sure that our facilities and employees are safe, and the disruptions have been occurring in, call it, the center of Bangkok. Our facilities, we have 2 primary facilities in Thailand that are pretty well outside of the Bangkok area, but we do have employees that are located, and so we're making sure that we've got appropriate transportation for them and that sort of thing, so that our facilities and our employees are protected. And we certainly, to your point, Rich, we've seen this before. We don't -- we continue to take it seriously because it could become more volatile. So we've got to keep a close eye on it, but we clearly have a number of different contingency plans in place to make sure that we can work through various different situations to ensure appropriate supply to our customers and protection of our employees. 
Operator: Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. 
Aaron Rakers: I guess, first question from me is just to go into the free cash flow generation. You've been very consistently north of $2 billion in free cash flow, but one of the things that's interesting is your cash conversion cycle is notably above your 4- to 8-day target range, which is reiterated in the material today. So just curious to how you're thinking about free cash flow generation as we look forward, and kind of tying that back to how do we get from a 19-day cash conversion cycle down to that 4- to 8-day range that's your stated target? 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, this is Tim. We've got opportunity in inventory, definitely, and we've actually been in transition a little bit because we've got a higher percentage of our total business which is now enterprise driven. So consequently, that does place a little bit of pressure on inventory. In addition to that, we have been utilizing finished goods for 2 purposes. First of all, in order to smooth out some of the linearity challenges, because we're making choices to take spikes out of the production and to build ahead where necessary and be able to carry a little bit extra inventory. That's one particular item from an inventory viewpoint. Secondly, we've also been making choices to put more inventory on the ocean in order to help our cost of goods sold. So, we are working the inventory pretty much in order to get to optimum positions. And I think we've got some room there. In terms of DSOs, we got worse in DSOs quarter-on-quarter, and that's driven a little bit by the peculiar linearity in the December quarter. Because, as Steve already mentioned, that the timing of Chinese New Year in the current quarter, the early timing of it, was driving some different behavior by customers. But the timing of the Christmas period was also an issue. So consequently, what we saw was a little lighter linearity in the October timeframe and a bit stronger linearity in the November timeframe. So consequently, we had to carry a couple of more days DSOs as a result of that. And our 4 to 8, we're going to reevaluate it, because I do think that there are some differences in our business that now have to be dealt with, and we're going to have to reevaluate whether the 4 to 8 is really appropriate. But we've certainly got an opportunity there in order to be able to generate more cash. And of course, we've got to keep the profitability, and Steve talked a little bit also about driving higher gross margin, higher ROC, and that will generate -- that will help us also to continue to generate the -- to generate the strong cash generation that we've been seeing for 8 quarters now in excess of $500 million. 
Stephen Milligan: Just to add one comment to that, just quickly. Absent Tim's comment in terms of, call it reevaluating whether or not the 4 and 8 -- 4 to 8 makes sense, given different dynamics in our business, which I think is obviously appropriate. The other thing is, is that there's no way that we're going to get within that range under the hold-separate arrangement. The hold-separate arrangement continues to drive inefficiencies in our business from a financial perspective, which we obviously believe translates to value that we can provide to our customers. And so, we'll be looking for an opportunity to request that, that be lifted in March. And that should help us address some of this as well. 
Aaron Rakers: Great, as the quick follow-up I'd just like to understand, as you think about the SSD business growing and kind of flowing through your model, so first of all, what was the dilutive impact that we recognize in the December quarter? Do you still see a $0.20 dilution in total for fiscal '15? And how do we think about that business ramping in the context of gross margin flowing on the consolidated P&L? 
Timothy Leyden: On a quarterly basis, it's a dilution of about $0.10 per quarter. And from a gross margin viewpoint, we measure that business on basis of ROIC and it's at the high end of our ROIC range. 
Operator: Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal. 
Keith Bachman: I wanted to go back to the TAM for a second. Last year in the March quarter, at the same conference call, you guided revenues for the March quarter to be down 4% to 6%, I believe it was. Revenues end up coming down sequentially about 2%, and the TAM was relatively flattish. So as you -- to Katy's question, I think you intimated that the TAM would be in the low 130 million range, 133 million, 135 million. I understand Chinese New Year is a few weeks earlier this year than last. But what's really the difference on how you're thinking about the TAM this year versus last year? Because it seems like a pretty big drop off. Or is there certainly some element of conservatism in there? 
Stephen Milligan: Keith, let me comment on that. Really, the dynamics that we're seeing, just to kind of oversimplify it, is it's primarily related to the PC market. And I know there's been a lot of commentary or speculation in terms of what's happening with the PC market. Let me give you our perspective on that. We have seen the PC market, I will call it, begin to stabilize. Obviously, the PC market still shrunk in calendar Q4. And so it's less bad than what it used to be. However, there is still a fair amount of cautiousness on behalf of our customers in terms of what the demand environment is going to look like, in terms of the first half of calendar 2014. That cautiousness is factored into the guidance that we've provided. 
 And not only that, the visibility that our customers have is a bit -- it isn't that -- I mean, in terms of the demand environment, they're just very cautious. Now that being said, I think one very important point is that our customers, in my view of -- in our visibility or knowledge of the PC channel inventory as best we know it, it's in very, very healthy shape. In other words, what I mean by that is [indiscernible]. And so that's very good. And so if there does happen to be, at this point, an unanticipated pickup in PC demand that's not reflected in our numbers, obviously, that will translate to upside to our numbers in the March quarter. But there's still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, Keith. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. And then my follow-up, perhaps if you can lay out as best as you can a framework or a schedule with milestones as you think about your discussions with MOFCOM and the Chinese? How should we be thinking about the sequence of events, the timing of the events and the impact of both, number one, your OpEx, and then number two, the opportunities with cost of goods sold? 
Stephen Milligan: Sure. I'll comment on the process as best I can. Just to remind everybody, in March, we have the opportunity, I will call it, reapply or submit a request to MOFCOM for them to lift the hold-separate restriction. In terms of how the process plays out from there, I'm sorry to say I don't know how that's going to play out. We don't have a lot of visibility to that. It's a new process. In other words, we are either the first or one of the first companies to actually reapply for that to be lifted. So we're going to have to see how that goes. In the meantime, our working relationship, more from the standpoint of us complying with the hold-separate, continues with MOFCOM and continues to be constructive. And we'll continue a dialogue with them as we get closer to March to aid us in having more transparency in terms of how the process will unfold, and we'll inform the investment community as we learn more as to how that's going to play out. In terms of the impact on our financial results, what we have said is that we believe that it will allow us to realize OpEx synergies of about $100 million a quarter. We have not quantified the impact from a gross margin perspective, but obviously, it will be beneficial to our gross margin profile as well. 
Operator: Next question is from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets. 
Mark Miller: IBM reported and I think Intel also reported that the server business was somewhat softer. And there are some specifics there for both firms. For example, Intel, I think had some problems ramping its motherboard shipments with its new Xenon chip. And I'm just wondering about the enterprise market. You've been flat there for the last couple of quarters on units where there are some industry-specific things that are impacting the market, and how does that look? 
Stephen Milligan: We were not affected by any of that and had no visibility to that. So as I indicated earlier, the performance enterprise business, which would be directly applicable to server-related activity, pretty much came in along our expectations. 
Mark Miller: Okay. And just as a follow-up, did you see any strengthening, or have you seen any strengthening as this quarter began or as the last quarter ended? Have we seen linear results or just normal seasonality? 
Stephen Milligan: Are you talking about the March quarter? 
Mark Miller: In the current quarter, I mean, is that showing any -- is that just showing normal seasonality? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, the March quarter, as we talked about earlier, Chinese New Year is early this year, earlier than normal. Also, we've got some rather large OEM customers with January year ends or quarter ends. And so linearity so far in the March quarter has been strong. The question is, is how sustainable is that as we get past Chinese New Year, as well as we move into what traditionally would be weaker times of the year, March, and then, obviously, April. But that's the next quarter. So those typically, from a seasonal perspective, are getting into the weaker times of the year for us. 
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Craig, Bank of America. 
Scott Craig: Steve, I was just wondering, on the PC market you talked about next quarter, the conservatism. How much of that is coming from the consumer market versus the commercial market? And then from an OpEx standpoint, let's just make the assumption that MOFCOM doesn't get released anytime soon. But what's the right sort of OpEx range that you guys can run it in? Is it the $600 million you're talking about next quarter? Or can you gradually burn some of that down a little bit back into that $500 million, $595 million range you talked about historically? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, so on the PC front, just to add a little bit more color, we have seen -- where the strength has come has been in the commercial segment. So the cautiousness is clearly in the consumer market. And so that's that. Let me give a little bit of context to the OpEx situation, and then I'll have Tim comment on the specific numbers. We're in a bit of a transitioning kind of period, really for 2 different reasons. One is, is that we've got the pending application or submission to MOFCOM, and what may or may not be the outcome of that, which at this point we don't know what the decision will be. The second thing is, is that we've got these recent acquisitions that we've done and investments that we're making in Enterprise SSD. One of the things that we want to make sure, we know that we are disadvantaged from a financial perspective versus our, in this case, largest competitor from an OpEx perspective, because we are required to carry, in some cases, 2x of whatever it happens to be from an investment perspective, given the regulatory situation that we're in. One of the things that we want to make sure that we are doing, which does drive a higher level of OpEx, is that we are investing appropriately in some of these new initiatives. And so as we go through this transition period, finding that right level of OpEx is a bit more challenging than otherwise it would be. And so that provides a bit more context in terms of, from a business perspective, what we're dealing with in terms of our operating expenses. So Tim can comment on the specific numbers. 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, so our guide for the December quarter was -- for non-GAAP, was $595 million. We actually came in non-GAAP at around $616 million. And the major differences there were driven by the stock appreciation rights, which covered more than 60% of the difference between those 2 numbers, and the balance was performance incentives. And in the longer term -- sorry, in the near term, near to midterm, I think $600 million run rate is probably a better number to go with for now. So a $600 million number is one that you should be plugging into the models. 
Operator: The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. 
Sherri Scribner: I was hoping to get a little bit of detail on your cash flexibility. Tim, I think you said you have $700 million in cash in the U.S. I know you have a strategy of spending about 50% of your free cash flow on dividends and buybacks, but it looks like your U.S. cash is getting a little tight. So I just wanted to get a sense of how much longer you can sustain that. I know you just did a refinance of your debt, but maybe some detail there would be helpful. 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, Sherri. The -- you're right in the numbers, $700 million as we closed the quarter. However, our -- the renegotiation of the bank loan did improve our position. We did that renegotiation for a number of reasons. The first one being, obviously, taking advantage of the market conditions. We also got lower rates. We got a longer time period, extending from 2017 up to 2019. We upsized the facility also. And the biggest advantage relative to your question is that we brought it from offshore to onshore. So consequently, the $700 million now has the capability to be able to be up around $3 billion or so. So consequently, we've taken action in order to ensure that we don't get tight relative to continuing to meet our obligations or what we've promised on the capital allocation front. 
Sherri Scribner: Okay. Tim, that's helpful. And then I just also wanted to get an update on your CapEx plans. I know you guys were in the middle of upgrading your wafer facility, that took a couple of years. Is that finished? And what would you view is the investments you need to make in CapEx this year? 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, we'd be able to stay within our 5% to 7% model. We've actually, for the first couple of quarters, I think we've been running more like 4%. We're -- from a CapEx viewpoint, I think we're underutilized in heads. We're underutilized also in substrates and sputtering, though not as much underutilized in heads. And of course, in assembly and in test, we continue to balance that and respond to the market. So I think we'll be -- we are pretty comfortable we will stay within the model, the 5% to 7% model. 
Sherri Scribner: And the wafer is done, is that right or no? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. 
Timothy Leyden: Yes. 
Operator: Next question is from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. 
Mark Moskowitz: I just want to build off of Sherri's question on CapEx. Steve, what's kind of your view if the market or the TAM improves by 5% to 7% this year, let's -- hypothetical, what would you be -- what would be your response? Will you kind of be measured and then not really have to add capacity during the first few quarters, or would you have to add at a pretty big pace? I guess we're just -- we're often just kind of curious in terms of what would be the kind of the puts and takes? Do you have it to really increase the CapEx if the... 
Stephen Milligan: I think we're addressing it at a little bit more general level. I think that we are in pretty good shape from an overall capacity perspective. In other words, if you saw the TAM increase to the number that you're talking about, we would not have to add a lot of capacity. We might have to add a bit of test assembly, but that tends to be lower cost. So I would expect that our capital budget or capital spending should be closer to the low end of that 5% to 7%. And certainly, where we're at year to date, we're actually below that. So I don't envision us making any meaningful capital additions this year that would spike that number upwards. 
Mark Moskowitz: Okay. And then the other question is a little more bigger picture. Just given the talent that WD has been hiring, as well as acquiring on the software side, how should investors think about your longer-term kind of place in the ecosystem of the data center? Are you going to have more of an impact in terms of helping design and architect systems versus just building the devices that go in the systems? And how does that impact your interaction with both the end customer as well as the OEM customer? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, that's a bit of a complicated question in the sense that the storage ecosystem, as we've alluded to, is changing quite dramatically in a number of different ways, and for, really, all participants. So that is for us and our primary competitors. It is for, I will call, our traditional customers. And it's also for some of our newer, if you want to call it, non-traditional customers, so some of the hyperscale guys. Also, the use cases, in other words, what people are doing with data, is changing quite dramatically. That then gets into increased complexity, increased fragmentation, increased opportunity for us and, if you want to call it, increased customization. That's allowing us the opportunity, whether it happens to be by providing additional tiers from a product perspective, if it happens to be adding different value from a software perspective, it allows us the opportunity to add value to our customers, whether they be hyperscale or traditional customers, in a different way. As we do that and if we do it -- if we execute appropriately, that certainly does provide us with the opportunity to look at margin expansion over time. We're certainly not committing to that, but we do think that that's an opportunity that we should be striving to realize as we move forward. 
Operator: Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Amit Daryanani: A couple of questions for me. One, maybe if you could just start -- if you could talk about your enterprise business. Looks like total units are kind of flat on a sequential basis. Any dynamics you saw within the business-critical and capacity-optimized side would be helpful. 
Stephen Milligan: Nothing particular in terms of performance or capacity enterprise. Capacity enterprise can be a bit lumpy. The -- in other words, it's a little bit project-based. We did -- and I'm not concerned about this, just so that everybody is aware. I think we did lose a bit of share in the quarter. That just tends to be the lumpiness about particular projects, and which customers, and that kind of thing. But the long-term and overall industry level from a demand perspective, things played out more or less as we expected it, nothing to really speak of, and we continue to feel very positive about how we're positioned from an overall competitive standpoint. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then, I guess, if I look at the free cash flow generation, which you guys talked about, has obviously been very strong for the last several quarters now, how do you think about the 50-commitment, the returning 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders? Given the deals that you guys have done, and now you have a good portfolio in the flash[ph]  side, do you start to evaluate that and potentially move that number higher? Or do you need the MOFCOM decision to be behind you to revalue that 50% threshold? 
Timothy Leyden: Certainly, the MOFCOM decision would help and the synergies that we would pick up from that would certainly be a help. But we do evaluate the percentage of free cash flow that we are allocating. And when we made the decision in September 2012, it was a pretty big decision for the company. It was something that we hadn't done before. So we're at the point where we're constantly evaluating it, and once we see that there is an opportunity to be able to respond to it and particularly, if we get some significant synergies from integration, then we would look more favorably at increasing it. 
Operator: Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Two if I could. I guess the first one goes back to gross margin, Steve and Tim. Steve, earlier, you commented that, I guess, what you saw as the meaningful drivers, our ability to add value, and then if you mix appropriately and sort of get SSD integrated in a responsible way, does that also suggest that TAM stays, let's call it, like a 135 million to 145 million range -- 130 million to 145 million range, where it's kind of been the last 6 to 8 quarters, that you would also have the expectation for margins to continue to appreciate over time? 
Stephen Milligan: So the -- if you go back to what we've talked about in terms of longer-term unit growth, which we talked about in September of 2012, we have not updated our expectations at this point, but we talked about a longer-term 3% unit growth. The real big swing factor there is what actually happens with PC sales. That does not assume growth in PC sales. It's more -- so the question is, what exactly? Because that's such a big part of the number, right? And so my comment -- if the TAM drops significantly, then obviously, we'd have to look at something. But I don't think -- we are not assuming that there is going to be a meaningful TAM expansion from an overall perspective. So if the TAM was in the 135-ish million range, just kind of use that as a round number. My comment that I made in terms of margin expansion still stands. 
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up for me, guys. What are your TAM expectations for 2014 calendar? 
Stephen Milligan: We haven't given a number, and at this point, I don't think we're going to be giving a number. We have to kind of wait and see. There's still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, uncertainty. But again, we'll have to continue to monitor. 
Operator: Next is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. 
Jayson Noland: Steve, I wanted to come back to your comment in the prepared remarks about customization in the cloud. I assume this relates back to the helium drives. But do you expect to see a fairly wide portfolio with specs that maybe differ by customer or by industry vertical? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. I mean, in other words, the use cases that we're seeing for various different customers are different. And so, accordingly, the solutions or the product suite that they're looking for varies. So there may be some customers that go to extremes that have no interest in Enterprise SSDs for whatever reason. And then you may have other customers that have a high degree of interest in that, but no interest in the helium-filled drive. So it depends upon how they are utilizing data in their organization. That's impacting how we work with those particular customers. 
Jayson Noland: It's a really interesting dynamic. I assume more R&D spend would be involved, and likely higher-ASP products and a higher-profit product also. 
Stephen Milligan: Correct. 
Operator: Steven Fox with Cross Research. 
Steven Fox: Just two questions for me. First of all, it looks like your average capacity per drive accelerated for the first time in about 3 quarters. Can you sort of talk about how much of that trend is sustainable going out over the next few quarters? And what drove it in the most recent quarter? And then secondly, I think you mentioned the SSD sales of $155 million. There was sort of, I guess, a onetime project in there. Just sort of how impactful is that as we look towards the next quarter on a sequential basis? 
Timothy Leyden: I'll address the average gigabyte, and Steve will address the SSD. So average gigabyte, the -- what contributed to that was a couple of factors. The first one is the strength in branded products, and that has a significantly higher per-drive capacity than the rest of the consumer business. And of course, we also had a strong distribution channel in the quarter. So that drove most of that improvement. 
Stephen Milligan: And then in terms of Enterprise SSD, the sole-source opportunity was meaningful enough that we felt compelled to comment on it, obviously. And given that, and that it is a bit of a nonrecurring situation, we may see our revenue decline slightly going into this quarter. But obviously, it's still a bit early to call that for sure. 
Steven Fox: And just to follow up on that, there's -- I mean, depending on who you talk to, you could see Enterprise SSD demand be as high as like 30%, 40%, if not greater, depending on what you think about capital spending. I mean, is that the type of industry you're sort of benchmarking against when you talk about outperforming the industry in coming quarters? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. 
Operator: Next question is from Joe Yoo with Citi Research. 
Joe Yoo: So your hard drive ASPs were up meaningfully on a sequential basis, despite gaming actually being strong. So I wanted to ask what drove the increase. And related to that, can you provide some color on the like-for-like pricing and cost declines for the quarter? And were they better or worse than expected? 
Timothy Leyden: Okay. So pricing was driven again by the strength of the channel and the strength of the consumer in branded. And that does tend to drive higher average ASP. And from a cost viewpoint, the cost decline has slowed down because the areal density improvement has slowed down. So what we're seeing is somewhere in the region of between 1% and 2% of cost decline. And pricing is following cost decline, so we're seeing pricing decline in moderation as well as a result of that. 
Joe Yoo: I see. And as a follow-up on the Enterprise SSD space or business, you guided again for another $0.10 dilution from the acquisitions in the March quarter. So should we be modeling a $0.10 dilution for much of this year, this calendar year, or should we be looking at some kind of relief from that dilution as we get into the second half? 
Timothy Leyden: That dilution will remain pretty much right through the end of the year, because we'll begin to see the accretion in the early half of 2015. So consequently, we should keep that dilution in the model through the calendar year. 
Operator: Next is from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. 
Nehal Chokshi: With the WD My Cloud, can you provide any metrics around the traction you're getting with this? And also, is it reasonable to believe that this is an incremental TAM above the current branded market, given the increased functionality and effective ASPs companies like Dropbox are charging beyond initial free capacity? Anything you can do to help us size this opportunity in an incremental fashion will be definitely helpful. 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, it's an interesting question. I'm not sure that, at this point, we have enough data to know if it's incremental to the traditional business versus just substituting other units. And so I think we'll have to continue to monitor that. Relative to specific data, we traditionally have not broken out specific sales of a given product. And so -- but we're very encouraged by the response from the marketplace so far. And we have, I'll call it, high expectations for continued success in 2014. 
Nehal Chokshi: And if I may, I'd like to ask about desktops. I'm not quite sure I understand why desktops were down when Intel reported an 11% increase year-over-year in desktops from their perspective. 
Stephen Milligan: We had a bit of share loss that's not reflective of the industry. Desktop, as an overall statement, is a pretty stable market. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. 
Joseph Wittine: I think the enterprise has been beat to death pretty well, but I'm going to ask a question again. You saw the flattening in the back half of the year. I'm just curious what's a reasonable expectation for unit growth going forward as we look into calendar '14. From reading between what you said, it sounds like we got a little bit of a pause in some of the capacity buildouts. So looking out over the next 4 quarters, theoretically, some of those ebbs and flows kind of gets smoothed out. Are we still looking at a high-single-digit/10% kind of unit number that I think you last spoke about at your most recent analyst day? 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, what we're looking for is somewhere in the region of high-single digits on an annual basis, and particularly in capacity. In performance, we -- that's going to be pretty much flat, I would say. 
Joseph Wittine: Okay. Great. And then on the cash return to shareholders, it seems like right now you're actually trending closer to 40% of the current run rate. I understand, maybe the cash flow weakens with the seasonality coming up here in the first half of the calendar year, but is that kind of the rate right now to expect, perhaps as you're still accruing $25 million a quarter for the Seagate court ruling? Or could there be a step-up there even absent a court ruling and absent a MOFCOM ruling, let's say? 
Timothy Leyden: Well, it's hard to be pretty precise about it, but our objective is to meet our obligations, which is to pay out 50% of the free cash flow. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things that happened in the December quarter which mitigated against that. One of them was we had to pay for the Virident acquisition and also, we had the secondary offering with Hitachi. And both of those... 
Stephen Milligan: Closed the window. 
Timothy Leyden: Didn't allow us to be able to be active in the market during the period that those things were open. So consequently, that mitigated against our ability to get to the 50%. 
Joseph Wittine: Okay. And then finally, a very quick follow-up. Tim, the $0.10 dilution that's there from the SSD acquisition, is that totally on the OpEx line? So -- and if that's the case, is it about $20 million, $25 million per quarter, in that range? 
Timothy Leyden: Yes, it's mostly in the OpEx line. 
Operator: Next question is from Rob Cihra with Evercore. 
Robert Cihra: Hopefully, I can get two questions in just to keep the pattern going. One, just on hybrid drives, nobody talks about them all of a sudden. I was just wondering what your progress is like there in the December quarter maybe versus your expectations. And then separate from that, in gaming, given the good strong start for the new game console cycles, obviously, it's helped the past couple of quarters. If you look at seasonality in that, it's not cyclicality, and through the year, how do you plan for that, given you don't have necessarily the same sort of seasonality you might have in most businesses? There's more of a cyclicality to it and particularly, maybe Steve, you have history there from your Hitachi days. How do you plan for that, given that it's sort of driven by 2 customers? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So on the hybrid, the volumes for 2013 were modest, which was more or less consistent with what our expectations. And what we have said historically and it remains the case, is that hybrid is more of a 2014 story for us. We'll have to continue to see at what level we make momentum from a customer perspective, acceptance of that kind of a solution. But things are tracking to our expectations. We did not expect the volumes to be that large in 2013. Relative to gaming, it's an interesting question. There is not really seasonality there. I mean, there's a bit of it in terms of when they build. But they tend to build earlier in the year, put them on boats, get them stocked up and save on the shipping costs, and that sort of thing. So I would say that we're very encouraged by the reception to the new gaming consoles. And I think that, that -- and also the fact that it's a one-to-one attach rate with hard drives. We do not obviously have all of that business, but we participate in a very healthy rate with the 2 customers that you commented on. And we do view that as a bit of a tailwind for the drive industry going into 2014. 
 So thank you, all, for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward. So thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair: I want to mention at the outset that we'll be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the December quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the December quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to insurance proceeds related to the Thailand flooding and expenses related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of today's call. I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our September quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter. The Western Digital team performed well in the September quarter. Outstanding linearity again helped drive great operating results, including strong free cash flow generation. We posted gross margins above the midpoint of our model range and our earnings per share were well above the high end of our guidance. These results reflect continued strong execution by both our HGST and WD subsidiaries. We expect the TAM in the December quarter to be roughly flat with the September quarter. Longer term, we remain excited about the opportunity to address the 34% annual growth in data that we are forecasting through 2020. Our strong financial performance has enabled us to invest in and execute on a strategic plan that we first outlined a little more than a year ago at our Investor Day. At that time, we identified growth opportunities in the cloud, in thin and light devices and in the Connected Life for consumers and the small and home office market. In addition, we cited Enterprise Solid-State Storage as an evolving growth opportunity. We also defined the capital allocation program of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders and potentially investing the remainder in strategic growth opportunities. We have advanced each of these initiatives over the last year, putting ourselves in an even stronger position to create additional value through innovation and differentiation. First, in our core business. We are on track to launch our new 7-disk helium-based sealed-drive this quarter to a select group of customers who value the total cost of ownership savings delivered by this innovative product. We are participating in the thin and light ultra portable device opportunity with a strong lineup of solutions, including our solid-state hybrid drives, as well as our 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter hard drives. We recently introduced our My Cloud family of personal cloud solutions, which enable users to organize, centralize and access their digital content from anywhere in the world. And to further strengthen our participation in the fast-growing SOHO NAS space, we recently expanded our industry-leading family of WD Red NAS drives to include a 3.5-inch 4 terabyte drive and a 2.5-inch form factor. In returning capital to shareholders, we have delivered on our year ago announcement by allocating approximately $1.2 billion to share buybacks and dividend payouts. On the strategic investment front, we recently strengthened our enterprise storage platform, with several acquisitions related to the application of solid-state storage and data center architectures. SSD in the enterprise and cloud is forecasted by IDC to grow from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $7.2 billion in 2017. We entered the space in 2008 through our joint development agreement with Intel, and since then have established a strong position in SaaS SSD devices. Our recent acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident augment HGST's existing Enterprise SSD resources, including the Intel JDA. Collectively, these assets provide us with a powerful platform to address this evolving growth space with a broadened portfolio of products and technologies, including the full range of Enterprise SSD devices, PCIe, SAS and SATA. Mike Cordano, who heads our HGST subsidiary, will be discussing their data center strategy in the keynote address at the annual Needham storage conference on November 6. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang to review the first quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Steve. We are very pleased with our September quarter performance, as we again demonstrated the consistency and strength of our business model, underpinned by great execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 139 million units during the September quarter, up from the June quarter and flat with the year ago period. The September TAM came in at the upper end of the guidance we gave in July. In our business, we saw strength in consumer electronics due to gaming, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and enterprise, and an anticipated seasonal pickup in branded products. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains very lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels. Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.8 billion, including $106 million from Enterprise SSDs. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 62.6 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter change in overall ASP was primarily driven by a change in business and product mix. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8%, excluding $36 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from HGST, sTec and VeloBit, as well as $11 million of fixed asset impairments and other charges. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 70 basis points, primarily due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected cost improvement. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $533 million for the September quarter. SG&A included the following items: charges of $13 million related to the acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident, and $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST and sTec intangible assets, offset by a gain of $65 million for a flood-related insurance recovery. We incurred additional interest charges of $13 million in the September quarter relating to the accrued arbitration award. Tax expense for the September quarter was $37 million, or 7% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $495 million, or $2.05 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million, or $2.12 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding sTec was $2.14, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.09. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $680 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $544 million. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter with free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our CapEx for the September quarter totaled $136 million, or 3.6% of revenue. Part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $150 million during the September quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the quarter. We exited Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which $1.4 billion was in the U.S. During the quarter, we drew down the $500 million available to us through our revolving credit facility. I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect the total available market to be flat with the September quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.775 billion to $3.875 billion. Gross margin approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $595 million, including a full quarter of sTec and VeloBit, as well as 9.5 weeks of Virident and excluding the amortization of intangibles. Our tax rate was in our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately $242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.10 for the December quarter. This EPS guidance includes a dilutive effect from our recent acquisition of approximately $0.10. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance, and we are excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market. In my final call as CFO of Western Digital, I want to say that I greatly value my 18 years of experience and relationships at the company, including relationships with many of you in the investment community. Most importantly, I want to extend a special thank you to my fellow employees for the great teamwork in building such an outstanding company with such great promise. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: The questions on -- as you look at the free cash flow generation, I know you mentioned 7 consecutive quarters at more than $500 million. As we look out going forward, do we believe that, that's a sustainable trend, especially now that we bring on the acquisitions that you guys have done? And how are you thinking about, I guess, in that context, that free cash flow generation? And any thoughts on changing whether or not the 50% return of that free cash flow is kind of -- enters into the equation with these acquisitions behind you?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: That's certainly the target, to keep the free cash flow up there, if we execute to our business model. Again, the acquisitions we're targeting to have accretive in the early part of calendar year '15. So we also think we have opportunities on the conversion cycle, for instance, on inventory turns. So it's clearly the objective and there is no change to the capital allocation strategy.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, Aaron, this is Steve. Just to clarify one thing, when we're talking about free cash flow, we're defining it as exclusive of the acquisition itself, right?
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Of course.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Two questions. First, if we were to go and look at ASPs, excluding the consumer electronics impact, can you give us a sense on what that might be? Then I have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I don't have the exact number here in front of me, Rich, but it's safe to assume that the majority of the ASP quarter-over-quarter change came from the gaming business that was included in the CE this quarter.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Would you also expect it to be material to the average gigs per chip?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: It reduces the average gigabyte chip.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitions, given their impact here, would you expect that after the December quarter for the OpEx level to decline? I mean, are you basically assuming in the December quarter that you really haven't had a chance to rationalize those businesses? And then any comments on product roadmap rationalization are we even -- know what they're offering today on how you're going to combine the, really, 4 SSD entities in terms of products available to the public.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I'll take the first part. We said when we announced the Virident acquisitions that our OpEx will peak somewhere in the 595, 590 range. That's where we are right now. We're going to be realizing some savings there over time. We're going to be very prudent to make sure that we're not impacting the roadmap. And I'll let Steve talk about the second part of the question.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, Rich, given that, particularly, the Virident transaction just closed last week, we are still in the process of rationalizing the roadmap for the various product lines, so no update at this point on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: I guess, this is for Steve and for Wolfgang, what would need to happen or how would you guys envision dynamics taking place going forward? [indiscernible] the gross margin because of the higher end of the range, and what would be the confluence you think you should get to gross margin to the higher -- and I guess the upper half of the range over time? And I have a follow-up, as well.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, that's an interesting question, sort of difficult to answer in a real straightforward way because generally, the thing that has driven gross margins up to the higher end of the range is supply-and-demand imbalances. And so obviously, we need to see some sort of a pickup from a demand perspective, and then presumably a supply constraint. We don't see that at present. But nevertheless, if we look at our margin performance, we're actually very pleased that our margins are where they're at and in an environment with, frankly, pretty sluggish demand, a pretty flat TAM that we've seen over several quarters. And so that's a testimony to the effort of our teams in terms of bringing down cost, managing mix and also moderating pricing pressure that we've seen.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: And then if I could just follow up on that. With regard to capacity utilization, as we sort of think into 2014, calendar 2014, can you give us some sense of how you guys, strategically, are thinking about managing your capacity, say, in an environment where, for instance, be a flattish environment going through '14? Would you look to hold it flat? Would you look to actually -- do you think to increase capacity utilization? How do you guys are thinking about it?
Stephen D. Milligan: We've been very proactive in terms of managing our capacity. Our infrastructure and our capacity utilization to the reduced TAM environment that we've seen over the last several quarters in terms of -- because the TAM was $160 million, $170 million in that range. Now it's in the, call it, $135 million to $140 million. And so we're keeping a close eye on that in terms of where that might go. And if for some reason or another the TAM were to contract, we would again take proactive measures to make sure that we're managing our capacity appropriately. And right now, we don't have any plans to expand our capacity until we begin to see some indication that the market's going to pick up that would support that.
Operator: And your next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you guys give us some more color on what you saw in terms of enterprise demand during the quarter, particularly in the business-critical segment and how you're thinking about that going into the fourth quarter?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, demand in the enterprise space, it was a little bit stronger in the performance enterprise, or business-critical segment as you refer to it, than what we expected. Frankly, we're not entirely sure what drove that. And so -- but a little bit stronger. We -- our share was a little bit off. And so -- but that's not reflective of long-term performance. Capacity enterprise was about where we called it. So generally, not too far off.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And how about the competitive landscape, obviously, you said the share was a bit off, but do you see any major change in terms of the competitive landscape, particularly heading into fourth quarter?
Stephen D. Milligan: I wouldn't call anything out. I think it continues to be as competitive as it's been in the past. But I don't think that there's anything particularly unusual right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: With regard to notebook units, it looks like they were down about 11.5% year-on-year, which was a bit more than we are expecting, I guess. Can you provide any color on what dynamics are impacting that segment?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, like I said in my prepared remarks, there is -- there's always -- we're always looking at the inventory at the OEMs as well and notebook drive shipments will not always coincide with PC systems shipments that leads us to the conclusion that both for us and for the market that the inventories at the OEMs are very, very reasonable.
Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Any color you can provide in terms of what to expect in the December quarter or perhaps the full year?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, we expect for the December quarter as we said a knowable [ph] TAM that's flat. We'll see client flattish with the enterprise flat to slightly up. Our branded products seasonally go up a bit into the December quarter, and then CE will ease off a little bit as the gaming systems that are being built, already use a little bit.
Stephen D. Milligan: So just to add a little bit to that, I mean, there's been a fair amount of commentary, I guess, I'll call it that, in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. We are seeing some sign of -- or hearing of some signs may be the better way of characterizing it, of a little bit of a pickup in terms of commercial notebook market. There is still cautious stance or position on the consumer side, particularly as we enter the holiday period. Those are kind of offsetting themselves right now in terms of dynamics because we're still seeing a year-on-year decline in terms of PC shipments, particularly in the notebook space. I think it's a little bit too early from our perspective to call this a -- I'll call it turnaround in terms of what's happening in the commercial space. I mean, there's some data points out there. We'll have to see how sustainable that is. And so we're taking a relatively cautious view until we begin to see a little bit more sustainable pickup in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. But there are some very moderate signs of some encouraging points of -- and we just have to see how sustainable that is and how prolonged that might happen to be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RNC capital markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk about the inventory build-up was up about 5%, sequentially. It seems like everything was on the raw material side, I'm assuming it has to do somewhat with the acquisition, but maybe you talk about what is organic versus due to stack mostly?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, several -- it's mostly on the raw material side. It's really staging for quarter -- December quarter is usually very, very linear, making sure that we can have the supply line into the customers be very steady. There's a little bit of an impact from the acquisitions as you can imagine. We're also investing actively in FGI. We're using ocean shipments where we can. And again, we're making sure that we're monitoring the demand signals very well so that we have the unit positioned in the just-in-time warehouses where we need them. So we watch the inventory turns very carefully, invest them carefully while watching the overall free cash flow.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the gross margin line, it was impressive, it was up 70, 80 basis points versus expectation despite the mix being severely negative but consumer up significantly. So maybe could you; a, talk about what drove that, and then as you get to December, I suspect the mix is getting better for you given the enterprise should ramp up. So why don't you expect the gross margin improvement into the December quarter given my assumption is mix is going to be better?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, first of all, I mean, we have managed the business to have acceptable gross margins in all the businesses that we serve. In the September quarter, we came in at a TAM that was at the upper end of what we guided to, so we shipped a bit more volume that helped free, in [ph] general, with the cost and the teams have done good work on general cost improvements. And the price declines in the quarter were a little bit lower than we had originally modeled. So it didn't come from one particular cost element or price element. It was like a combination of a few things. And then again going into the December quarter, yes, we have chips branded as up a little bit, CE is down a little bit. That's why we're saying the gross margin is flattish as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Two questions, if I could. One on cash, just the -- so you said, Wolfgang, with $1.4 billion onshore, I guess, just if you look out over the next -- I mean, couple of years, do you see U.S. cash being a limiter to capital allocation plans? And if it was, would you just simply look at raising more debt or repatriating because I'm thinking your offshore cash could be pretty big. Just sort of wondering how you would approach that, and then I have a follow-up if that's okay, unrelated.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: That's a good question. There's several paths to the solution, and we believe with a couple of years runway just from free cash flow that we create in the U.S., plus the opportunity to pay down our current debt and take it on, onshore. If you recall we designed it that way when we made the HGST acquisition. So we have that flexibility in the credit facility. Our leverage ratio with that is at a very modest level. So we have significant incremental debt capacity. And we believe, depending on what we do on the strategic front with our capital allocation strategy that, that will get us through the next couple of years. And then we'll have to see what happens in Washington and -- because this is not a situation that we're in by ourself. It's like 1.6 trillion of U.S. profit trucked offshore. And either there is a change there, or in perpetuity it will be someone repatriating cash and having a tax impact on that.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, it makes sense. And if I could ask an unrelated follow-up, the -- just the strength you've been seeing in enterprise demand especially in the capacity side, do you see that being driven? I mean is that traditional OEM selling into traditional enterprise, or is that sort of cloud type data centers driving the upside? I mean, do you get a sense of -- I'm assuming the latter is certainly helping, but I mean how much is it helping, I guess?
Stephen D. Milligan: Rob, it's a little bit of both but certainly the hyperscale guys build out, from a cloud infrastructure standpoint helps a lot with them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just as a follow-up to the last question, will it be possible to give us some idea on these hyperscale landscape cloud properties? How big is the revenue stream from them, maybe as opposed to digital [ph] to enterprise revenue, to total revenue?
Stephen D. Milligan: At present, we don't provide that information.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then if I look at your Enterprise SSD revenues, which you just reported this quarter, the quarter-over-quarter sequentially Enterprise SSD revenue is kind of flattish in spite that you have like 3 weeks of stack revenues in NAND [ph], so just kind of wanted to understand that.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, one of the things that we have been seeing in the NAND demand market is some constraints from a supply perspective. We're beginning to see that sort of free up a little bit. And also with the additional acquisitions, I think that we'll see going into the future a more robust quarter-on-quarter growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on linearity, Steve or Wolfgang, you mentioned it was very good. What's behind that? And is that something that we should expect to continue?
Stephen D. Milligan: It's really kind of, fundamentally, the way that we run our business. We really place a lot of importance on cash generation and also managing our build and our inventory levels very closely to the way that our customers pull on product. And also not unnaturally, I'll call it stuffing things in at the end of the quarter. And so it's been something of an -- I can go back to my days at Western Digital back pre 2007, and it was a discipline that existed within Western Digital then. And it's a discipline that we built over time within HGST. And so it's just part of the way that we do business, and I would certainly hope that you'll continue to see the benefits of that from a financial performance perspective.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And as a follow-up, I wanted to try one on the hyperscale cloud buyers. I recognize you can't use names, but any color you can provide on your level of R&D engagement with this community -- visibility you might have? Just wanted to try to understand the depth of the relationship here as -- in general.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, I'm trying to think how to dimension that question. I mean, we enjoy very strong relationships with a number of different customers, including many of the hyperscale guys. And we see the benefits of that in our financial results. So I don't know if I can comment beyond that. I apologize for not being able to go deeper, but that's kind of where we're at.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to dig a little bit into your expectations for the margins for the SSD business as we go forward. I know you said that you'd expect those businesses to be accretive, and I think you said early 2015. What type of margins would you expect those to be in line with, Western Digital's corporate margins, or do you think they'll be higher than that as we move into fiscal '15?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, first of all, we're managing our business based on ROIC. So the margins by business line greatly depend on what CapEx, and what we're putting into a business. But we believe, based on the roadmap that we have outlined now, that we have all the assets of sTec, Virident and VeloBit that we'll get to a gross margin profile that's around the current corporate profile.
Stephen D. Milligan: I think the other thing to add is that as we have added capability in terms of our Enterprise SSD products, it also is allowing us to wrap enhanced value around the devices that we're providing. And we refer to that as intelligent devices and that sort of thing and there will be a software component. Those clearly will carry higher gross margins than what our overall corporate average. Now how that moves the needle in terms of our overall gross margin profile I think will depend upon how our growth plays out and how the market also plays out.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And now that you've done a number of acquisitions in the SSD space, do you feel like you have all the tools that you need to compete there, or do you think there are pieces that are missing?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, we're going to continue to evaluate that. But I think that right now, we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: Just 2 questions for me. First of all, in the context of wishing Wolfgang good luck, is there any update on the CFO search? And secondly, Steve, just some of your preamble regarding new products, I was curious on the helium drive and the ultraportable products, are you saying that you're shipping in this quarter or can you just clarify timing for commercial revenues?
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure, in terms of the CFO update, our CFO search, no update -- search is continuing. And so that's where we're at with that. And then on the new product front, we will be realizing revenue this quarter related to the 7-disk helium product. And we are currently shipping and realizing revenue, of course, on our 5-millimeter, 7-millimeter products, as well as hybrid versions.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: Okay, and any I don't know, just pushing it a little bit but is there any comment in terms of how that is ramping or what type of products you are having the most success with on the mobile side?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well Peter, if you'll recall, when we talked about -- and I'll talk about the hybrid product, that was really -- we were envisioning that more of a 2014 story. So at present, the volumes and the revenue are not that significant, but that's consistent more or less with what we were expecting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I was hoping you could give us an update on, a, the timing; and b, the range of scenarios or outcomes as it relates to your discussions with MOFCOM. And then I have a follow-up, please.
Stephen D. Milligan: The timing and what else did you --
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The potential range of outcomes and what I mean by that is there are different scenarios on the potential size or magnitude of release?
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure, so the timing is that we have the opportunity to remind everybody 2 years after the closing of the transaction. So coming up here in March in 2014, we have the opportunity to -- I'll call it reapply to MOFCOM to have them reconsider the whole separate arrangement that we have. At this point, we -- it's too early to speculate. And it's also too early to speculate in terms of the range of outcomes. And not to sound facetious, but your guess is as good as mine in terms of what that might look like. That being said, we are encouraged in terms of our ongoing relationship with MOFCOM in terms of our compliance and also beginning discussions in terms of the reapplication process.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, so then my follow-up is seasonality for the March quarter, I think with a flat kind of TAM in December, you're -- I think the PC industry has been experiencing less of a seasonal bump in December quarter. I think that there also might be some opportunities to have less of a seasonal down in the March quarter, given where the drives are ending up or the PCs are ending up more in Asia with Chinese New Year and whatnot, but I just wanted to see if you wanted to provide us with some initial thoughts at least on how you're approaching seasonality in the March quarter off of that TAM in December.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I'll probably start it off with just how historically the TAM behaved. What we do know is that our branded business is declining a little bit. We have still a strong January and February, but then it's quarter-over-quarter a little bit down. Also, the CE business is quarter-over-quarter down a little bit, again mostly related to the gaming build. In terms of enterprise, we see that market steadily growing. And then the PC business is the one to watch. Historically, it is flat to slightly down going into the March quarter. But again Steve mentioned that there are some signs of a commercial pickup. We just got to watch that very, very carefully and then just do what we always do, react to the downside or to the upside.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Any commentary you can provide or any numbers rather on like-for-like ASP declines, or if no specific numbers, at least talk about which subsegments saw lesser like-for-like declines in your expectations in which you may have seen more?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Well, I think the only piece that's useful here is like-for-like price decline was less than the like-for-like cost decline, and therefore, our gross margin increased. So we didn't see anything extraordinary in any of the markets as we drove past down we ship that was how [ph] customers but there wasn't anything extraordinary in anything.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then on OpEx, I understand you're not guiding for the synergies you're going to have from the deals, but can you confirm that from where we sit today that the December quarter will likely be your near-term peak from a dollar basis?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, that's the intent. I mean, we're not going to shut down an investment or make a hasty decision if we're not clear on the roadmap but that's the intent like we outlined on the Virident announcement call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moscowitz with JPMC.
Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just want to fall back on the CapEx topic. Steve, what's your view at some point, do you have to start spending more in CapEx just for next-generation technologies and could that provide any sort of incremental lift to CapEx or has it kind of already streamlined into the model just given your continuous investments in technology?
Stephen D. Milligan: We're investing today in next-generation technology, so I think it's kind of embedded in the numbers that we're seeing already. There may be some investments that come that may -- I mean, it's nominal in terms of the impact, in terms of certainly our CapEx range, and then maybe some big piece of equipment we have to do a particular quarter or whatever. But we are not delaying anything in terms of new capital investments from a technology perspective to drive our free cash flow generation unnaturally in the short term.
Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, so there's nothing on the horizon that could surprise us 6 to 9 months out?
Stephen D. Milligan: No, not anything that I have visibility on right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: I'd like to also talk about CapEx here. As a percent of revenue, it was around 4% for your second quarter in a row, which is below your target model of 5% to 7%. So are we looking at a new level of CapEx? And if so, why is that? And then also can you talk a little bit longer-term about in the context of potentially a flattish unit growth environment, but ahead in planner [ph] growth, how would that also affect your CapEx rate?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, it's like, like Steve said, really, I mean, there's always different elements of CapEx in our model, and right now, we just don't need to spend on capacity. And we're spending on things like tool upgrades for new aerial density, we're spending on technology, we're spending on solidifying our supply chain, for instance, we now have 2 slide effects on the WD side. There's no reason to update our CapEx model right now and the final outcome for the fiscal year will really depend on what our view is at the tail end of the fiscal year in regards to the demand. In terms of head and media [ph] account, I do think that both of our subs -- the situation where the demand for gigabytes will outstrip what the technology can deliver on aerial density growth. So naturally, the head and media [ph] count will likely go up over the years, so that will first improve the utilization of our current assets and then at one point in time, drives us to do some incremental investments in capacity.
Stephen D. Milligan: But right now in terms of our component utilization in terms of from a capacity perspective, that's probably the area where we are the most underutilized. Part of that has to do with the hold separate situation. In other words, there's certain degree of mismatches between the 2 units. And so we're actually pretty comfortable, as a general statement, with where we're at and if component counts go up, and then depending upon what happens in terms of the hold separate situation, we think we'd be able to optimize our component utilization without necessarily adding loss of capital.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: So at the end of the day, is there room to potentially move below the target model if demand does not tick up on a year-to-date [ph] basis?
Stephen D. Milligan: I think that's something that we have to continue to evaluate, but I think it's a little bit too early to make that call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sterling with Barclays.
Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was just wondering, how far out would you say, call it, half a year, 1 year until we can maybe get OpEx closer towards the long-term operating model?
Stephen D. Milligan: It's going to depend upon -- we've said in the past that in order to get into the 10% to 12% range of operating expense, it would require us to be able to realize synergies as it relates to the combination of WD and HGST. And so as long as the hold separate situation persists in the current form, we'll continue to operate at a higher level of OpEx than what our target range is.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Yoo with Citigroup.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Guidance if I could. As you know, Nidec and LSI both guided to...
Unknown Executive: Joe could you start over -- you cut off at the beginning?
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I mean, just wanted to get some clarification on the TAM guidance. As you know, Nidec and LSI, your suppliers both guided to a TAM closer to $135 million for the December quarter. And historically, obviously, WD has been more conservative on the TAM guidance versus others. So could you help us understand the discrepancy a little?
Stephen D. Milligan: I'm not sure if I can help you with that, because I don't know the basis for Nidec or LSI. But undoubtedly, my guess is it has something to do with their unique view and they're also one step removed from a supply chain perspective. So it may be something to do with an inventory situation or what-have-you that they're saying. So I don't -- I'm not sure I can clarify that. But we carefully evaluate where we think the TAM's going to turn out. And I may say this and end up being wrong, but I think that we've done a pretty good job historically calling the market.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, and my follow-up is maybe if you could provide some color on the adoption of hybrids among OEMs. Are you expecting any meaningful volume as you head into year end?
Stephen D. Milligan: I commented on that earlier in terms of we really think it's, for us, it's more of a 2014 story. In closing, I want to thank all employees for their dedication and outstanding performance in Q1, and our customers and our suppliers for their support. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and all of our employees, I want to thank Wolfgang very much for his outstanding contributions and service to the company and wish him the very best in his new venture, which he begins in early December. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth, the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the September quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results, expectations for the September quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items, such as amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition, certain tax-related matters, certain employee termination benefits and other charges. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. Until our acquisition of sTec closes, Western Digital and sTec remain independent companies. So we will not be taking any questions about sTec's business or its financial performance today. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note the copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital.
Stephen D. Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our June quarter results and outlook for the September quarter. I am pleased with our performance in the June quarter. Our financial results were strong, including significant free cash flow generation, reflecting outstanding execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries. Industry demand in the June quarter was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the September quarter to be up modestly. Our production levels will be adjusted to prevailing demand conditions. Our growing participation in the storage market continues to highlight our broad-based role in the important and secular trend of digital data growth. We anticipate that the demand for exabytes of storage will grow by at least 34% per year through 2020, with exabytes shipped rising from 600 in 2012 to 5,900 in 2020. With advancements in storage, processing power, software and big data analytics, storage requirements are increasing significantly. There are thousands of new applications that are emerging based on new capabilities. An excellent example is the capability of one website that is processing 200 billion flight reservations to advise it's users when to optimally buy airline tickets. It is clear from applications like these that storage and the utilization of vast amounts of data are enabling breakthrough innovations, providing tangible support to underpin these data growth forecasts. Our goal is to innovate and differentiate our solutions to help our customers create value in this dynamic environment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the breadth of storage solutions we are providing. The Western Digital platform is unique, powerful and market-driven, underpinned by increasingly collaborative customer relationships, leveraging our rich engineering heritage and resources. For our fiscal year ended June, approximately 50% of our revenue was derived from applications in markets that are powering the public and personal cloud. While we are encouraged by recent innovations in the PC space, with less than half of our revenue as we exited fiscal 2013, the storage industry is experiencing dramatic change and we are participating in the high-growth markets of the future, investing in innovation and strategic acquisitions. In the last year, we have led the industry with the introduction of several new advanced solutions including our 7-disk helium sealed drives for cloud storage, our low-profile 5- and 7-millimeter solid-state hybrid drives and hard drives for ultra portable devices and new hard drive and mass solutions for small and medium businesses. All of these products have been well received by our customers. At our Investor Day last September, we indicated that we had established a strong position in enterprise solid-state storage with our family of SaaS-based SSD solutions. We also indicated that we were evaluating an expansion into other areas of this market. We concluded that solid-state storage will play an increasingly strategic role through continued innovation and differentiation. As a result, we recently made several important investments to strengthen and expand our enterprise SSD capabilities, including our proposed acquisition of sTec, an early pioneer in enterprise-class SSDs, the acquisition of VeloBit, a provider of high-performance storage I/O optimization software, and our investment in Skyera, a provider of very high-performance storage arrays. The sTec and VeloBit acquisitions will augment our existing technology position and IP portfolio in one of the industry's fastest growing markets. In summary, we are pleased with our performance and position in today's changing storage industry, and we are continuing to take steps that will enhance our ability to become one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our June quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model, our sustained strong execution and the continued change of our business mix. The HDD industry shipped approximately 133 million units during the June quarter, slightly down from the March quarter and in line with our expectations in late April. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise. Stable quarter-over-quarter performance inclined in consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded products. On a year-over-year basis, our business mix reflects our strong participation in growing cloud-related markets, with capacity enterprise and branded products up significantly. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $15.4 billion. Broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, our non-PC-related business has grown from 35% to 50% of our revenue. Among PC-related businesses, includes our enterprise, branded and consumer electronic businesses. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion. We shipped a total of 59.9 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business mix and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.1%, excluding $35 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 60 basis points better than our guidance, reflecting better-than-expected business mix and capacity utilization and lower-than-anticipated price declines. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $582 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $18 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred charges of $8 million in the June quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. Tax expense for the June quarter was $35 million or 7.8% of pretax income. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $416 million or $1.71 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $477 million or $1.96 per share. For fiscal year 2013, our net income totaled $1.7 billion or $6.75 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $2.1 billion or $8.53 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $684 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $548 million. For fiscal year 2013, we generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. CapEx for the June quarter totaled $136 million. For the full fiscal year, we invested $952 million or 6.2% of revenue, including approximately $191 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would have been at 5% of revenue, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in the current demand environment. As part of our capital allocation strategy, first outlined last September at our Investor Day, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $235 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2013, in total, we repurchased 19 million shares for $842 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the June quarter. In total, we declared a dividend of $1 per share or a total of $240 million during fiscal year 2013. We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. As disclosed in our press release, our financial information for the June quarter does not include any additional accruals as a result of the decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. We're in the process of reviewing the decision to determine whether or not to record an accrual for the June quarter. I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter, which does not include the estimated impact of the proposed sTec acquisition. For the September quarter, we are cautiously optimistic about a modest increase in the TAM, and we anticipate sustained strong performance within our business model. We expect a total available market of 135 million to 140 million units, up from the June quarter, primarily due to a seasonal uptick in gaming and branded products. Revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin well within our business model, and approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. Tax rate within our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately 242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance and we're excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving -- of the storage market. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: On the quarter, when you look at your operating expense line, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected in the June quarter. Can you talk about where we stand, as far as operating expenses, let's say, beyond the current quarter? And how we should maybe think about the progression of that operating expense relative to your long-term target model of 10% to 12%? And I do have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, Aaron. If you look to our investors summary, total operating expenses worth $590 million. That included $8 million of other charges. There were $10 million or $11 million of amortization of intangibles in there, and there was another $7 million of restructuring charges. If you deduct all of that, you're at $565 million, which compares to our guidance of $550 million, and the entire difference was due to incentive accruals that we took based on the performance of the teams. So we pretty much came out exactly like we anticipated and the real operational difference are intended for growth. As it relates to the go-forward spending, we've been very successful to keep it around that $550 million, and we'll be prudent going forward. We have said in the FAQ document that we issued alongside with the announcement of the sTec acquisition that, that will increase the OpEx for the time being. So we continue to be prudent and -- but we'll not forgo investment opportunities. And then of course, we will have to work longer-term on amortization, which will then give us a catalyst of to get into our 10% to 12% business model.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow-up, thinking about the business model and, obviously, thinking about you capital allocation strategy, you've seen a fairly consistent trend on the cash flow generation over the past several quarters, given what you've laid out for the September quarter, is there any change in the trajectory or that trend as we look out over the next couple of quarters in terms of free cash flow generation?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, $2.2 billion and each quarter above $525 million. That is a sign of a pretty stable, well-managed business. We intend to keep it that way. We stand to our capital allocation strategy, 50% of free cash flow, like we announced last year in September at the Investor Day, and we have no change as to that, today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 questions for me. First, on the SSD front, I know you don't want get too much into comments on sTec, but the -- is there any sense you have that you could give us now on whether or not, post-deal, that there'd be enough revenue where you could actually break SSDs out as a category? Right now, it's basically a plug, but is there any way you could comment on that? Then I have a follow-up.
Stephen D. Milligan: Rich, that's an interesting question. This is Steve. I mean, obviously, we'd like to think that the revenue gets big enough that we can break it out. I think we'll have to wait and see how it works out. We've been encouraged, in that we are limited, because we're still going through the regulatory review process and we're 2 separate companies, but we've been encouraged by the customer reaction that we've gotten regarding our proposed acquisition and we're comfortable that we think we're going -- that, that's going to be a sound investment for us and we're looking forward to working through the regulatory approval process in closing that transaction. So I hope that I can tell you after we get through a bit that we're big enough to be able to disclose and separate that out.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of that appeals court commentary, is -- should this actually go against you, would you be able to use your full cash balance, including the offshore, or would you need to use the domestic dollars?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: We would use offshore cash.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: Just 2 questions on 2 different end markets. Just -- from looking at your branded sales and looking at Seagate's, I know you mentioned seasonality in that market, but I was curious if there's any kind of weakness in demand relative to the market, or maybe you're gaining some market share there. It seems like both companies, it's my observation, were relatively weak in that market. And if not, maybe you could just talk about how you think it's going to proceed for the rest for the calendar year? And then, secondly, on the flip side, could you talk about maybe the enterprise market? It's obviously been very strong because of some web scale spending. Do you think there's a pause coming in that or how do you sort of gain the demand trends there?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I'll start you off, Steven, and then Steve will probably comment on top of that. Branded, really no surprise, it's seasonally a soft quarter, particularly Europe is always very soft at this time of the year. Very pleased with the mix. You're seeing sell-in data that we're reporting. We're very pleased with the inventory levels in the market there. I'm very confident that, that market is seasonally picking up in the next 2 quarters. So really nothing that we wouldn't have expected there. Ongoing move there to NAS Boxes away from direct attached, but really nothing extraordinary to report on. The enterprise market last quarter was a little bit stronger than we expected and particularly on the capacity enterprise space. And that's really playing out as we predicted it as well. Performance enterprise is stable, but not up. Capacity enterprise, up. And like we said before, that segment of the market that we think for the next 5, 6, 7 years, has the strongest growth. And we said before that we wouldn't be surprised if that would be double digit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Choksi with Technology Insight Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: So client performance was -- client hard drive performance was flat Q-to-Q, which is consistent with the third-party market research organizations. But in the March Q, the hard drive and Western Digital client performance outperformed. I was wondering if you could talk about that in the context of hybrid and dual drive uptake by OEMs. And to follow-on with that, can you talk about what your expectations are with whether or not hybrid drives will be GM accretive, and if it's not GM accretive, will be at least gross profit accretive per unit?
Stephen D. Milligan: So in terms of our business, we, for the first half of the year, have not been impacted by -- we're not shipping a hybrid drive in terms of the first half of the year. It's really for us, more of a back half of calendar 2013, and in particular, 2014, as we see customers begin to adapt that sort of a solution. And now, customers are, as you referenced, dual-drive configurations are meaningful. And we're kind of agnostic, frankly, whether it's a dual-drive configuration or a hybrid configuration. And so, because both of them, ultimately, use a hard drive or spinning disks. Now in terms of the gross margin comment, I'm going to deflect that question in the sense that we don't typically talk about gross margin by product, whether or not it's accretive or non-accretive. And so I'm going to not answer that question.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Okay. Do you mind if I ask a separate question then?
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: The cash conversion cycle, that was up an unseasonal 5 days quarter-over-quarter. And looks like it was primarily driven by an increase of DSOs. But you guys clearly said that channel inventory's not an issue. So can you give some clarification as far as what's really going in -- on here? And does this impact your visibility into September quarter relative to past September quarters?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Nehal, there's no change in payment behavior of our customers. We had really good linearity in the quarter, as you can see from our free cash flow. The uptick in DSO is purely a function of channel mix. If you look at the channel split, our OEM business went from 60% to 66%, and our Distribution business and Branded business went down. So no significant change. Seasonally, expect that -- and doesn't have any impact on visibility on the September quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: I guess, two, if I could. The first is just a general question around gross margin dynamics. Could you give us an update on, I guess, where you are with the single platter shift and what the impact -- at least [indiscernible to margins was this quarter? And then, can you first speak to why margins wouldn't go up in the second half of the year? Or is there a chance for that and you're just sort of being prudent with the guidance, given sort of more stable than expected like-for-like ASPs and what's going on with mix? And I have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: So as it relates to Q4, gross margin, we're very pleased to beat the guidance by 60 basis points. And that was really a function of several things, capacity utilization, but also of business mix, more enterprise business, and then lower like-for-like price declines. As we go into the September quarter, the flat margin is more or less a function of the business mix. We have plans for modest price declines and, as every quarter, we're trying to optimize the results as we go through the quarter.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: And just some clarification on the transition to single platter, and then I have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: We're making steady progress. Last quarter, I told you that we're around 50%, and that we would probably take another year or so to completely transition it. We'll do that when it economically makes sense, and we're making steady progress on that front.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And I guess, the last thing for me is can you speak about, or is it too early to speak about it, could you give us some sense of what your expectations are for the game cycle? Refreshes are taking place in the second half of the year and, traditionally, that's been, I guess, a really strong market for you guys. So I guess, any detail you can give us around how we should be thinking about that in the context of industry potential and WD potential would be helpful.
Stephen D. Milligan: I'm sorry, what cycle? I didn't understand what you said.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: The -- sort of, I guess, the new Xbox and the new PlayStation.
Stephen D. Milligan: Oh, yes, yes, yes. So those are 100% attach rates and part of the demand increase that we're -- or TAM increase, I guess, I should say, that we're expecting in calendar Q3 is reflective of that, the gaming build that will take place for the Christmas season. And so we're happy that it's going to be a 100% attach rate. And we will, as a company, we've been a relatively big participant on the gaming business. I mean, there's only 2 guys, right, Microsoft and Sony. And we will continue to participate in that business to the extent that it makes economic sense.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Thanks, Steven. I guess, that suggests sort of de facto share gain in the second half of the year, since you guys are the dominant player there?
Stephen D. Milligan: I wouldn't imply that. I mean, we've been a strong participant in that market, if we're going back for a while. And so I wouldn't imply that we think that there'll be share gains solely as a consequence of that, right? We have to see how everything plays out.
Operator: Our next question comes Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The first one for me is, could you provide some comments on what you think the TAM does in December?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. We assume, right now, in our modeling that's around 140 million units.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So...
Stephen D. Milligan: One of the things that we're going to have to do, Keith, and this is -- it's going to be interesting to see. I mean, obviously, the news on the PC front has not been that rosy, right, in terms of what some of the other guys in the supply chain have talked about. And so now, what we're beginning to see is some building of product, sort of filling the pipe for back-to-school and for the holiday season, particularly, back-to-school, really, at this point. I mean, we're beginning to see increased sort of demand levels as a consequence of that. The key thing that we're going to have to see is, how does that product sell-through, right? Does that actually translate to either a flattening in terms of the declines that we've seen on the PC side or maybe a little bit of growth? And so what we're doing is taking a pretty cautious approach to that. And so -- but I certainly, it's kind of -- it's sort of a different question than what Rich asked about splitting out SSD, I'd certainly like to be able to report increasing or accelerating PC sales, but I don't think that we're at the point where we can say that yet. You have the sell-through happens.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Well, my second question actually relates to that, Steve. Over the last 4 quarters, and in particularly the last 2 quarters, your client units have done significantly better than your competition. And what's driving that? And would you give any comments on does that continue? And obviously against Seagate in particular?
Stephen D. Milligan: I don't know if I can comment on that both because, I mean, we have not had a specific strategy to increase our share in those markets, which is kind of interesting. And so, sometimes we look at the share numbers after the fact and -- because it's not a goal of ours to say, "Hey, let's go and increase our market presence in that particular market." And so, I have a neat answer for you, other than, and it may sound a little bit self-serving, we are -- both WD and HGST have done a great job from an execution standpoint. And that's allowed us to increase our position in those marketplaces.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Any thoughts on whether that continues, Steve?
Stephen D. Milligan: I don't want to call that. Obviously, we want to make sure that our good execution continues. And if it happens to result in profitable gains from a market share perspective and the right kind of financial performance, we're happy to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: First up, I wanted to see if you could reconcile your projected growth in the TAM in the third quarter with your sales guidance. So the TAM, at the midpoint, you're up 3% or 4% sequentially. Your sales guidance at the midpoint is up 50, 60 bps, or something like that. So are you -- is that conservatism? Or are you perhaps going along with the last question, perhaps planning to concede a little bit of share after gaining quite a bit of it over the last few quarters?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Like Steve said, I mean, we're not really going into a quarter with particular share targets. We're trying to execute well and then put linearity in good products. But that's mostly a mix factor. In particular, the gaming business is a lower ASP business and that just plays into that equation.
Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC: And then, you already said looking at -- talking about free cash flow for '14, you said you'd like to continue the stability, I guess. Any thoughts within that on capital expenditures? Do you still expect to be within the bottom of the range next year as you were this year?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, we will be in our business model from 5% to 7%, and we will heavily be focused on technology deployment and upgrades to new aerial densities and supply flexibility, et cetera. Then we just need to decide as we get into the second half of the fiscal year what the predictions are for the end of calendar '14, and that will determine where we end at the end of the day. But you should assume that we'll be extremely prudent and as just in time as possible with deployment of capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: It's Dan Garofalo on for Andy. I just wanted to talk about, from a restructuring standpoint, you've continued to kind of rightsize manufacturing, and if we set aside anything related to a favorable MOFCOM ruling, where would you say you're at with the rightsizing process? Are we -- are you kind of halfway done doing what you can do? Or is there more than less than that? Or how would you characterize that, I guess?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, I'll answer it this way. I mean, if you look at our financial performance, I mean, obviously, we want to do everything that we can to continue to improve our profitability. I think if you look at our gross margin performance, we're solidly within our gross margin range, which kind of implies that the actions that we've taken sort of seem to be appropriate from a rightsizing perspective. And that's, obviously, based upon, let's just use round numbers, say a TAM of kind of that 135-ish kind of range, 135 million a quarter. The thing that we have to watch closely and we're certainly not predicting it, but this is, do we have something further? If that were to change, and decrease, then we'd have to look at doing something else. But I think that we're comfortable where we're at, generally speaking, from a capacity perspective, given that kind of a TAM level.
Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Great. That's helpful. And then, just one follow-up for me. On the enterprise side, I think you've indicated that the 7-platter helium drive should be out sometime in the second half of the year. And I know you've touched on those in your prepared remarks, could you provide an update on timing there? And secondly, when the drives are available, is it fair to say, you expect some movement from market share perspective within the capacity optimized segment?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So we -- we're currently sampling these products with selected customers right now, or that product with selected customers. And we continue to expect that we will have units shipped and revenue realized before the end of the calendar year. The first generation product will not be a particularly significant volume product to start out with, as customers test it out and that sort of thing. So I would doubt whether or not that will meaningfully move the needle in terms of any market share in the capacity enterprise, at least initially. And then we'll have to see how the adoption goes from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just have a quick clarification. Can you give us some -- or can you give us the numbers for your nearline SATA enterprise versus the performance enterprise?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Sherri, we haven't broken that out.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you give us some ballpark or help us think about it in terms of magnitude?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: What we have said before is that our share in all the areas of the market that we serve is comparable. And the performance enterprise market is pretty stable, just shy of 8 million units compared to the last quarter.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, just thinking about the recent acquisitions you've done with VeloBit or at least that you've announced in Skyera, just trying to understand the motivation for doing those acquisitions? I understand those to be primarily sort of SSD array type of companies, and you guys are an HD business, it doesn't seem like you'd be doing arrays yourselves, that would seem to be competing with your customers. But just wanted to understand where you're going with that technology?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So Sherri, just to clarify one thing. We did not acquire Skyera, we made an equity investment on Skyera back. And that -- and that's more of reflective of our interest to stay close to the technology changes and advancements that are going on in that space, as opposed to us getting into, per se, the storage or the SSD array kind of business. So that's one clarification. The VeloBit acquisition which, from a financial perspective, was not particularly significant, is really to provide software capability in terms of input/output optimization, caching kind of capability, that sort of thing, to improve our existing -- or any future offerings that we have in the enterprise SSD space. So it really is an effort to make our products more compelling than they otherwise would be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Couple of questions. One, I guess, if I look at the finished goods inventory, it was up about $22 million, 5% sequentially in the quarter. Could you maybe talk about what were the drivers that led to that uptick?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I'll take that question. Overall, our inventory was pretty stable for the last 3 quarters, and there's always a bit of a shift between the raw and FGI. But we have made a conscious decision to invest in FGI in 2 areas. Number one, we're making more use of boat shipments in areas where we understand the demand very well, and that contributes to our cost savings. And the second one is, we want to make sure that our just-in-time warehouses have sufficient inventory at quarter-end to make sure that there is a smooth operation guaranteed at our customers' level. Overall, we believe that we all the time have opportunity in the inventory space, but probably more in the raw and whip [ph] area that in the FGI area. So we're pretty pleased with the executions, very stable, but future opportunity is likely.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough. And I guess, if I just look at the September guide, you guys are suggesting gross margin should remain flat on a sequential basis. To me, at least it looks like the mix is going to end up being a bit of headwind with gaming's up, picking up on a sequential basis. Maybe just talk about what are the offsets to that mix being a bit of a drag in the September quarter?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, you're right that the mix is a bit of a headwind but then it's likely a little bit of a higher volume. That's a tailwind and then we'll continue to work on our costs and all the other elements. But you got it, the mix is the headwind and we're offsetting it with cost and good execution.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just going back to the compute market, notebooks, specifically, were up more than seasonal. Can you talk about what area of that market you think you're taking share?
Stephen D. Milligan: Kate, I don't know if there's any specific area, per se. I think I commented on earlier in terms of -- it wasn't so much that we had a deliberate strategy to increase our market share in that particular segment, but both of our subs, just really, frankly, did a very nice job working with our customers in such a way that we were actually able to kind of keep our situations sort of flat when the market was down a little bit, and we were able to gain a little bit of share.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I understand visibility is probably pretty low, as you said, you're seeing build for back-to-school, but you got to see demand, are you seeing any signs in your business of a demand recovery in traditional PCs, or the traditional enterprise storage market?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, okay. That's kind of a two-pronged question. The traditional PCs, I mean, we -- our customers continue to be very cautious with regards to what they're seeing from a PC demand perspective, whether that be desktop or notebooks. And particularly, notebooks, right, is where the real cautiousness is. Desktop has tended to be a little bit more stable over time. When you start moving into the enterprise space, I mean, it depends upon who you're talking to and, obviously, we don't care to talk about specific customers, but with what we're seeing from a digital data growth perspective, demand in that space, overall, continues to increase. And that's reflective in the unit increases that we're seeing in terms of our enterprise business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I'm not sure how much it's related to the last question in -- earlier on, nearline, but Steve, maybe when you combine your SSD moves, about the strength you've had in the SaaS side and then in your planned acquisitions, and you look at the traditional enterprise market, I mean, do you look out and feel like traditional enterprise is a growth market or a shrinking market getting squeezed between nearline, at the low end, and SSD, at the high end? Or do you feel like that's actually a positive growth market going forward?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So traditionally, you hit the nail on the head, the traditional enterprise business, we do not view as a growth business. It's fairly stable in terms of its demand, which is great, which is fine. But the growth areas in terms of enterprise are in the capacity enterprise market, and then also we believe in enterprise class solid-state drives.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Right. And if I could ask a follow-up related to that, would you -- my guess is, no, but would you guys be willing to share what percentage of your enterprise revenue, even ballpark, is direct to kind of big web scale customers rather than through traditional OEM channel?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. I appreciate the question but that's not one that we're going to address, Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: A few questions back. And I know you want to be cautious. But Nidec yesterday reported a 16% increase in their unit shipments of motors to hard drive manufacturers, and yet both you and Seagate, in terms of your TAM expectations, are certainly below that. Is this an inventory restocking thing or more cautious, or both?
Stephen D. Milligan: I don't know, Mark, honestly. I haven't gone and studied what Nidec disclosed. But it's -- it's obviously not -- it's got to be inventory-related. I mean, because it must be a replenishment thing, but that's speculation on my part.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Okay. You certainly made some big efforts recently in the solid-state drive market with your acquisition. But I was just wondering, 2 weeks ago, Micron kind of surprised people. A lot of people feel that they -- because of technology challenges that solid-state drive, NAND flash, can't be pushed much further beyond the 18-nanometer node. And a lot of firms are now looking at three-dimensional type flash. SANDisk, for instance, is talking about that in 2015. Yet Micron came out and said they, by perfecting a high-K metal gate process, were able now to -- are selectively sampling 16-nanometer flash and estimates are that they would have a factor 2 margin advantage if they can pull that off over competitors at a higher node, which if you look at it conversely, it could actually lower the price of, say, a 128-gig drive and keep margins same as some of your competitors' by $15 to $20. I'm just wondering any comments on that in terms of the impact on your solid-state or your hard drive business.
Stephen D. Milligan: I don't have any direct perspective on that, Mark. But I think that one of the things that we've got to keep in mind is that, I mean, flash or NAND is shipped into a lot of different applications. And those applications have different reliability or different characteristics. So I don't know if Micron is alluding to those being able ship into kind of client applications, which maybe have a different profile associated with them, it's one of the things that we've recognized and is part of the value add that we provide, as a hard drive company, is making sure that products that are provided meet the right criteria for enterprise kind of applications. So Micron, along with some of the other NAND guys that is accompanying that, we are working with and want to continue to work with, in terms of what it is to utilize their technology to the advancement of our customers.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: So your relationship with Micron would not put you at a disadvantage if they start competing against other people shipping flash coming out of a higher node? Is that correct?
Stephen D. Milligan: I think that the opportunity in the marketplace is big and I don't -- I think that there's plenty of opportunity for all of us.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: It was MLC flash which, I think, probably feels more for a lower end type storage application because of some of the issues with program arrays with MLC flash.
Stephen D. Milligan: I want to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and suppliers for their support. We look forward to being in touch with you. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. Well, I want to mention at the outset we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the June quarter and calendar year 2013, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance including our financial results expectations for the June quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 1, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures that we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly factsheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and other charges. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks by our CEO and CFO from today's call will be available on the Investor section of the Western Digital website immediately following the conclusion of our call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our March quarter results and outlook for the June quarter. I am pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. We continue to execute well and capitalize on the ongoing secular growth in digital data. Industry demand was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the June quarter to be flat to slightly down with the March quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the potential for a modest seasonal uptick in demand for the second half of calendar 2013. Our production levels will continue to be adjusted to prevailing demand patterns. In the March quarter, both the HGST and WD subsidiaries continued to deliver outstanding financial results, driving gross margin performance well within our model. We continue to effectively manage the diverse elements of our business with a keen focus on operational excellence and value creation for our customers, shareholders and employees. Customers continue to respond favorably to our breadth of product offerings and value-based engagement model. It is important to note that we have established a leadership position in the fastest growing areas of the storage industry. These include our high-capacity drives and solid state drives for the cloud, branded product solutions for the personal cloud and leading, small form factor drives for thin and light mobile devices. Given our strong pipeline of innovative new products, we have the opportunity to sustain this favorable momentum for the foreseeable future. Currently, we are seeing strong market response to several new products, including our new family of 5-millimeter, 2.5-inch hard drives and solid state hybrid drives for ultraportable devices; our 7-disk, helium sealed drive platform aimed at delivering significant total cost of ownership benefits for hyperscale data centers and our expanding range of SSD offerings for the enterprise space. We continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for storage and our increasingly strategic position within this vast digital data ecosystem. Western Digital is one of the best positioned technology companies to leverage the ongoing creation, transfer and storage of data, a trend linked directly to consumers' increasingly ubiquitous experience with data in all aspects of their lives. We believe digital data growth will continue unabated for the foreseeable future with total exabyte shift growing from 600 exabytes in 2012 to at least 5,900 exabytes by 2020, representing a 33% compounded annual growth rate. Consistent with other recent commentary, we believe exabyte growth is a better and more relevant measure of the growth potential for the industry and our company. Western Digital is a market- and customer-driven company focused on growth and innovation. We develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers, an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market-maker. We believe this approach will continue to be one of the key factors in helping us to achieve strong business performance. The Western Digital platform is powerful with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our value-creation model within the storage ecosystem. I am confident that this approach will continue to result in strong and sustainable financial performance, further differentiating Western Digital as one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize the total market demand and our consolidated financial performance for the March quarter, and then conclude with a range of our expected financial results for the June quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are very pleased with our March quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model. The HDD market shipped approximately 135 million units during the March quarter, flat to the December quarter and in line with our forecasted range in late January. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded product. Our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers are also in good shape. Our revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. We shipped a total of 60.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business and product mix, and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines. The average capacity per drive we shipped in the March quarter was 810 gigabytes, a 35% year-over-year increase. This reflects strengths in our branded and enterprise businesses as well as solid mix-up in our client business to cope with the ever-increasing amount of digital content. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.2%, excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 120 basis points better than our guidance as a result of better-than-expected cost improvements and product mix, and lower-than-anticipated price declines. A broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, the revenue contribution of our non-PC related business has grown from 35% in fiscal year '08 and is projected to account for more than 50% of our revenue in fiscal year '13. As a reminder, our monthly fee-related business is comprised of our branded products, consumer electronics and enterprise business, which includes SSDs. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $581 million for the March quarter. SG&A included $22 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred additional charges of $63 million from the March quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we had already incurred total charges of $147 million in the prior 3 quarters, reflecting ongoing infrastructure alignment as well as an evolution of our organization to address growth opportunities. Tax expense for the March quarter was $15 million or 4% of pretax income. The rate reflects the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $391 million or $1.60 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million or $2.10 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $727 million in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $539 million. Our CapEx for the March quarter totaled $188 million. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be at the upper end of our CapEx model, including approximately $200 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would be close to the bottom end of our model range, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in today's environment. Out of our capital allocation strategy, we have repurchased 5.2 million shares for $243 million during the March quarter. In addition, we declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60 million, which we paid on April 15 to shareholders of record as of March 29. We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. I'll now provide our guidance for the June quarter, which anticipates sustained strong performance within our business model during what is typically the industry's softest quarter. We expect a flat-to-slightly down total available market when compared with the March quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion, reflecting the current demand and pricing environment and the seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin, well within our model at approximately 28.5%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect tax rates within our 7% to 10% model and the share count of approximately 243 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.80 for the June quarter. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: [indiscernible] and how it impacts your business. I'm sure you've all seen that PC units were down substantially in the March quarter, but if we look at your PC business based on the desktop and the notebook, you were up a little bit. Now I know that those businesses are not exactly correlated, but I think some people are concerned there are some inventory building somewhere in the channel that would describe that difference between what you were seeing and what the PC market is seeing. Can you give us some more detail on why there would be a difference there?
Stephen D. Milligan: Sure. This is Steve. I mean, one of the things that I think that we have to continue to keep in mind, I mean Wolfgang alluded to it in his prepared remarks, is that we're becoming -- first thing is we're becoming less and less of a PC story and more of an overall digital data growth story. So although we are still impacted by what's happening in the PC market, it's becoming less and less. That being said, yes, the PC market was down. It was only down a bit more than what we actually had forecasted, so our underlying assumptions did not expect there to be particular strength in the PC business. So we were not that surprised on the downside in terms of what happened there, and the fact that our units are up was really more a reflection of our ability to gain a bit of share from an execution standpoint. And then lastly, as Wolfgang indicated, we do not believe at present that there isn't any sort of an inventory issue in terms of the PC market that we're aware of.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to get a little more detail on the near-line market. How large do you think that market was? What do you think your share was in that market? And what type of growth expectations do you have for that going forward?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, Sherri, that market grew healthy quarter-over-quarter. We believe it was up from 7.5 to like 8.5, 8.4, 8.5, just like a solid increase quarter-over-quarter. Our share there is very solid. Our share is very well distributed across all of our businesses. Our average share outlook is 44.4, and I'd say our market's up plus minus 2% in that range. And we said before that it's one of the markets that we believe will show solid growth in the future, and we previously said that we expect double-digit growth in those markets. And that's volume and on top of that, significantly more data growth in that market in particular.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to dive a little deeper into one of your comments on the gross margin side. There were some cost savings and, I guess, unanticipated or accelerated cost savings. Was any of that head related or the transition to new aerial density benefiting, or if you can just elaborate a little bit more on those elements?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, Rich, the team's executed very well. We have extremely good linearity, which helped us earn a bit more market share, for the volume was slightly higher than we thought. That helps with the overall absorption. We're not done with the aerial density transition, but we made solid progress. And lastly, I think with our suppliers, and we are now what we would call in a more normal area in terms of internal external sourcing. So all of these things paired with solid execution on -- in both of our subs helped us to -- has better cost than one we thought.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Joe Quatrochi for Aaron. I was wondering if you could comment maybe on your days payable kind of increasing because the -- your CCC to increase to 12 days. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of how to model that going forward.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, our cash conversion cycle target model is 4 to 8 days. We're a tad over that. It's less a function of the days payable. We like that in that range that we displayed. We have made very conscious investments in inventory. As you know, we're restructuring quite a bit in various operations. And when you do that, you want to make sure that you're sufficient, both for materials and plays. We also make sure that we take advantage on where we understand the demand signals very well of ocean shipments; that's quite a cost saving. And then lastly, and particular, our enterprise customers, we want to make sure that we have solid just-in-time warehouse inventory in front of them so that they -- so we don't disrupt their pools as they conduct their business. So midterm opportunity there, I would say more on the inventory turns. But we watch this thing very, very closely. But with the free cash flow of $539 million, we didn't make this one of our top priorities but it's an opportunity going forward.
Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I was wondering if you could comment a little further on OpEx. It looks like it was up sequentially in the quarter, yet headcount was down. I was wondering if -- when we might see an impact from the decrease in headcount going forward.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: First of all, just approaching the 581 to the 540 that we have in our guidance, first of all, the 540 was a non-GAAP measure. So there's about just shy of $20 million on incremental accruals on incentive plans since we overachieved. There is a $10 million or so standard amortization of intangibles that's there every quarter, and then we had a legal settlement there as well. So normalized for incentive payouts, we were pretty much exactly right on with our guidance. In terms of looking forward, we have a reduction of headcount that's mainly in the factories, which you would see the COGS line. But we're also reducing headcount in the OpEx areas but not to bring the overall OpEx down, it's to create room to invest in the growth areas. So we're investing in enterprise, in new platforms and we're investing in SSD and other areas. So the target of the restructuring there is -- let's reduce the number for now from the 550-ish kind of level. It's more to make room for the growth and strategic growth areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: I guess this is for either Steve or Wolfgang. Why would gross margins be down in the June quarter off of March if pricing is -- sounds like you're saying pricing is a little better than you expected, and it feels like, just based on the margins you reported this quarter, that the mix is probably leaning at least as good, if not better than you expected. Would just love to get your thoughts on the gross margin dynamics in June.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I'll give you like the -- some of the drivers. First of all, volume, we said the market is slight to slightly down. So we anticipate that our volume will be down and that doesn't help with cost. But the main driver here is it's seasonally the softest quarter, but it's also seasonally a quarter where we have interesting channel mix dynamic going on. You're shipping more to OEMs, you're shipping less to retail, and in particular, desktop distribution channel is down in this quarter. So it's mainly a function of reduced volumes and business mix. And then we've modeled some price decline for the quarter as well.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division: Got it. And that's helpful, Wolfgang. Can you -- you guys mentioned -- Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, I guess, of good adoption of new products. And I know you guys have -- you have the hybrid drives that are out, saw your 5-millimeter announcement, so new enterprise products are coming out and you have the single product drives. Can you give us a sense -- or actually, some drives and some new game stations as we go through the year that I think are actually higher cap. Can you give us some sense of how we should expect the mix to manifest itself on the business as we move through the year? And what -- yes, I know you're not going to be able to give guidance on the gross margin, but it seems like you have really nice mix up. And so any help sort of on how we should think about all those factors manifesting in results would be helpful as we go through the year.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, so I'll comment on that. We continue to expect our mix to improve. I mean, it's a little bit when I -- I'll talk a little bit about a longer term view. There's always seasonal things that happen quarter-to-quarter, but the mix trends are very favorable from our perspective and it comes back to the fact that digital data growth continues to be very substantial. And people need to store that data somewhere and they need more storage as opposed to less storage. And so we're going to continue to benefit from that. And as we mix up, that is -- that provides better economics for us. And so the longer term, if you want to refer to it as secular trend, is favorable from that perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. First, Wolfgang, can you take us through the sort of free cash flow usages as you see it for the rest of the year? You talked a bit about CapEx, but maybe where that's going to be spent outside of the $200 million on the Thai-related issues, and then as well as buyback and stuff like that? And then secondly, maybe a question for Steve. Can you discuss the investment in Skyera and just sort of your thought process behind that and maybe why not a PCIe guy? Why on flash? Just sort of kind of take us through your thought process there.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, on the free cash flow, it's really straightforward. I think we had 3 quarters and well above 500. We expect another solid quarter. I think the linearity is going to be okay. We've guided to a CapEx number that would let you conclude that we have somewhat lower than what we spend in Q3 in CapEx. That CapEx now is mainly really focused on technology development, robustness of the supply chain, and then as we mix up in test capacity as well. In terms of what we do after the free cash flow, we stick to the 50% capital allocation strategy to shareholders as a percent of free cash flow. I think we're just a little bit shy of that, and the intention would be to catch up by the end of the fiscal year.
Stephen D. Milligan: And in terms of Skyera, just to comment on that, Skyera is a small company based in San Jose that is privately held, focused on SSD array technology. We have been involved with Skyera for a while, both in terms of an initial equity investor as well as we worked with them on a number of different technical areas. And we had the opportunity to participate in their latest equity round, and we're glad to do that. We've got a lot of interesting technology and we're -- not only from an equity perspective, but also just from a technical collaboration perspective. Very pleased to be working with them. In terms of your comment why Skyera versus something else, I don't think that it's an either or. We're very interested in the broader solid state memory area, particularly in the enterprise area, and that includes things that we're doing in terms of our existing enterprise SSD business, also in terms of what companies like Skyera is doing, and also in terms of PCIe. And so this just happens to be one equity investment that we were able to make in the past 90 days.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the TAM as you see it this year after -- you specifically identified that the TAM in the June quarter would be flat to down a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about sequential growth or second half growth and any more specificity? And more broadly, just want to hear some thoughts on if the PC market -- most consensus, I think, are now down 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% in terms of units. But if the PC market is down 7%, 8% for the next couple of years, what do you think the TAM growth would be for the HDD business against that type of backdrop?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Well, I'll start it off, Keith. So our own assumptions, I think Steve said in his remarks, is a modest seasonal uptick in the second half. And the emphasis on seasonal, I mean, that's purely driven by back-to-school, holidays. And one of the products Steve has talked about, the gaming business that's strong in the second half as well. So you want me to put a number around it, it's somewhere around 140-ish or so. So I think that's a prudent planning assumption. In terms of the PC growth...
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Sorry, 140 for the kind of the September quarter, I assume you mean?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, September and December. And then I think Steve said it that, yes, I see and Gartner has posted, I believe, 11% and 13% decline in the first quarter for the PC market. That was not too far off what we had modeled in our assumptions. I think we wouldn't disagree with like an assumption of like 5% or so year-over-year decline of that market. IDC and Gartner forecast the market then to resume, like, modest growth. I think we would agree with that. And we continue to believe that our market, from a volume perspective, is increasing from this year on by like 3%. And that's really driven by capacity, enterprise and branded. And we quoted the numbers on our PC and our non-PC related business, and we continue to see that trend to go to non-PC related businesses.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right. So philosophically, if the market's down 5% to 7% on a sustained basis, you think you can have positive unit growth even against that PC backdrop?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes.
Stephen D. Milligan: If we go back, Keith, I mean I think that there's a couple key points to emphasize. I mean, one, we are not anticipating a meaningful change in terms of what's happening in the PC market. We're not counting on that. We're being very cautious with regards to our production plans in that regard. The other thing is that we talked about, at our Investor Day, was a longer-term unit growth rate in terms of HDDs of 3%. That continues to be our current assumption, but that growth is not coming from PCs. It's coming from other areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Two questions. I mean, one, you guys are guiding for a flattish TAM in the June quarter, flat down. But I think your sales sort of implies sales will be down somewhere in the 4.5% range. Can you talk about how much of that is pricing-driven versus potentially, you give up some of the share gains you had in the March quarter as you go through June?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Amit, the first impact is really from a segment mix, like, for instance, the pricing in our branded products is significantly higher than if we ship into a gaming solution, for instance. And so that's a big driver. If you look for like-for-like pricing, I mean, we have modeled modest declines there. And share is not really something that we plan for, that's more like an outcome. We plan to have really good product and deliver it in a very linear fashion to the market, and the share is what the share is.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough. And then if I look at just the enterprise side, it actually looks like you guys picked up a decent amount of share in the March quarter. When you think about it, I mean, do you think that was more a reflection of just the right customers you're partnered with or some of the newer technologies that you're talking of that has started to take more adoption, and that potentially could accelerate, I would imagine, as you get through the year?
Stephen D. Milligan: I don't know if I would draw any significant conclusions one way or the other in terms of the share. We did pick up a little bit of share in enterprise. Now if you go back, we had lost a little bit of share. So there are share gains and losses that occurred quarter-to-quarter occasionally within rough moderate ranges. And so I don't think that I would point to anything significantly per se other than the fact that, a longer-term thing, we continue to provide compelling products to our customers and we engage with them in a way that they want to buy more of our product.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: A couple of questions for you. One, there's been a lot of hopes within some in the industry about a pickup in the second half due to things like the Windows XP end-of-life April next year, Ultrabooks for some folks, and some saying a better supply of touchscreen panels for Windows 8 notebooks would pick that up as we head into late next -- late this calendar year. And I'm wondering, is that in your guidance or would that be providing upside?
Stephen D. Milligan: Right now, we, as well as many of our customers in the PC space, are being very cautious with regards to the demand expectations. We'd certainly like to see and hope to see some of the dynamics that you're talking about to increase demand in the back half of the year. Right now, we are being pretty cautious in terms of our outlook from our standpoint as we talked about earlier.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: So it sounds like if that really transpires, that would be an opportunity for upside for you, is that right?
Stephen D. Milligan: That's possible, that's possible.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: Okay. And then my follow-up question, with your 5-millimeter drives, it seems like you're getting a bit of a head start on the competition, and I'm wondering if that's really the case. And also, I'm hearing that the connector for your drive is different than the industry standard and would not be a drop-in replacement for other 5-millimeter drives. And I'm wondering if that's true, and if so, what the philosophy behind that is.
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, we're working very closely with a number of different customers to look for them to adopt to our 5-millimeter drive. And we've been pretty pleased, both in terms of the standard rotating magnetic drive as well as the hybrid drive, to get some adoption of that product as we move through the back half of the year. And so we're very encouraged with where we're at. In terms of the adapter, you're right, it is not a traditional industry standard adapter. We did that to provide for enhanced shock characteristics in terms of the mobility for that drive, and we're getting positive response from our customers so far.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I'm just wondering if we can go back and if you can update us on your cost structure a little bit more. And more specifically, what percentage is a variable cost? And then as it relates to that, if we look at utilization, I know it's difficult to kind of paint with a broad brush, but what components have the lowest utilization and conversely, what ones are the highest?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, we haven't really given out the exact split between fixed and variable cost. I mean, you can look at our -- if you check our non-GAAP depreciation, amortization's like $260 million a quarter. So you can assume that that's just probably around half of our fixed cost. I mean, the rest is factory engineering and utilities and maintenance and stuff like that. So I think we have an industry-leading cost structure in terms of what part is variable. And then in terms of capacity utilization, that remains an opportunity in certain parts of our business, I think you have characterized it well. You can't speak about capacity utilization in general, though. There are certain aspects of our infrastructure that are very tight, like I mentioned, that we're investing in test capacity. And there are certain aspects that were not hit by the floods and they are a little bit long right now. I wouldn't want to go into exact detail where that is, but we're balancing that every quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you just help us think about the PC mix and ASP you're embedding going forward? And I'm curious because on the one hand, you have the PC OEMs that are under a greater margin pressure and pressure to reduce pricing to drive some unit volume. So do you think that drives lower capacity drives into the market? And doesn't look like that's a trend you're seeing, but do you think there's an offset here from higher hybrid drive shipments? Can you just talk about the industry dynamics and how to think about that impact to you?
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So OEM customers are our PC customers. I mean, the primary issue that exists is that they've got to get compelling products out there at a cost point that compels consumers to purchase them. And sure, of course they're cost-sensitive. But I think the bigger issue is the product's got to be right. And so if you look at what we're doing in terms of the 5-millimeter product, what we're trying to do is provide a thin and light storage device that our customers can design around that provides a more compelling product for them. It's not going to make a big difference to them if they save $1 or $2 on how much they pay for them.
Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, with the PC market pretty much kind of where you expected it, can you just talk about where -- how far along you are and reactions to reset capacity, where you're comfortable and maybe just give us some other quantitative or qualitative idea of where you are?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, you've seen us with a couple of quarters of restructuring activity and you see our gross margin well within our model, so we have been very, very active. And that little bit of something that we have to wait and see. I mean, we said that we expect a bit of an uptick in the second half of the year. So we'll just watch that very, very carefully and we've proven historically that we can react in the unit direction in terms of capital deployment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I think Steve talked about kind of impact of PCs on your TAM. I want to touch base on the impact from pure declined SSDs on the TAM, too. So if you look at third party data or what OEMs are saying, they think 2013, we can see at least 20 million pure declined SSDs? So could you maybe talk about, first of all, do you think it's possible, something like that kind of a volume? And secondly, how that could impact the business?
Stephen D. Milligan: So what's interesting in terms of what we've seen is that the issue in terms of hard drive TAM, right, because it's obviously down, it's down from 170 million pre-flood to 135 million this past quarter. Clearly, we've been impacted in that regard by lower PC sales. But it's not because of SSD replacements within PCs. In fact, we've actually seen that pure SSD as an alternative for hard drives has not changed significantly from what we expected or from what we've seen historically. Now you are seeing dual-drive configurations where you've got SSD in a hard drive. And so that -- but we're agnostic to that. That's okay from our perspective. The issue is that there are competing devices, for example, tablets, that are more compelling to customers that they're buying instead of PCs. And so if you go back to the 5-millimeter story or the hybrid story, what we're trying to do as a company is provide a more compelling storage alternative in a thin and light package that our customers can work around, design more compelling products to have them buy a PC or a PC-like ultraportable device and versus a tablet.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: And then just one last one here regarding Skyera. Skyera makes its own SSDs, so is it possible you might look at kind of selling the SSDs, not just the systems made by Skyera?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, they're an SSD array company, primarily.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Market.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I'm just wondering if you could estimate right now the percent of data being stored on the cloud that's gone on hard drives, and where you think that might be in 3 years?
Stephen D. Milligan: Mark, when we look at it in terms of data storage, we believe that -- I can't remember off the top of my head, frankly, what the timeframe was, but that moving into the future, I think it was either 2017 or 2020 that 85% of data will continue to be stored on rotating magnetic storage.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: And then also comment on the margin differential between the drives used in cloud storage and a typical lap drive in a PC.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I mean, the -- the drive that's going to the cloud, of highest quality, highest engineered products and they command the margin premium, so they're significantly higher than the margins in the PC space.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Would I be wrong to ballpark that between 75% and 100% higher on average?
Stephen D. Milligan: You're not going to quit on your question, are you? You're not going to back off? And Wolfgang's not going to answer either.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Two questions, if I could. One, just wondering where you are in progress on a 500-gig per platter notebook and 1 terabyte on desktop. You seem -- I'm assuming you won't say anything in terms of percentage of your mix or anything, but maybe just relative to your roadmap in terms of rolling out those capacity points this year. And then my second question, just going back to enterprise, you had mentioned there's good organic growth in near-line demand or capacity optimized. Just wondering if whether in the near-line or the mission critical these days, you think there's any lingering recovery still from the September quarter inventory correction, if that's helping at all or if that's kind of long done, and what we're seeing now is true demand?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: From the aerial density, we're less than 50% on the latest and greatest. So that represents an opportunity of quarters for us. And then what was your question, near-line was...
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just how much of -- whether near-line are also on that sort of a traditional enterprise, if any of the sort of sequential growth you saw on the quarter that you're seeing now still has anything to do with you're still recovering from September quarter, last year's inventory correction, or if you think that's long past and what you're seeing now is true end demand.
Stephen D. Milligan: We don't believe there's any inventory issue in that area of the market, and that our -- it represents true unit demand. All right. I want to thank you, again, for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and their suppliers for their support. We look forward to being in touch with you. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes the call for today. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-01-23 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. 
Bob Blair: Thank you, and good afternoon. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, HDD demand for the March quarter and calendar year 2013 and our financial results expectations for the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on November 2, 2012.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and other charges. 
 Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.
 [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan 
Stephen Milligan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, CFO, Wolfgang Nickl, will provide additional commentary on our December quarter results and outlook for the March quarter. 
 I am pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. The quarter exhibited continued soft industry demand driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, weak PC demand and inventory rebalancing by our customers. Over the last several quarters, both of our subsidiaries have done an excellent job of managing through challenging market conditions. This is particularly noteworthy given our company's specific cost challenges associated with the recovery from the Thailand floods. We have continued to focus intensely on those variables we control, allowing us to produce better-than-expected revenue and profitability and strong cash generation. 
 In calendar 2013, we have several opportunities to improve our business. We believe that the overall market for hard drives is beginning to stabilize. We expect demand for the first half of calendar 2013 to be flat to slightly down compared with the back half of 2012. However, we are cautiously optimistic for the back half of 2013 for the following reasons: Worldwide economies continue to expand, albeit at a slow pace, with signs of further improvement in developing regions. OEM customers have largely worked through their inventory rebalancing. Accordingly, we have improving visibility with regards to true customer demand. Our customers are accelerating their product innovation with thinner and lighter designs, coupled with touch-enabled features and there are early indications of consumers' stronger intentions to purchase new PCs this year. 
 I am most pleased with Western Digital's leadership position in the storage industry. We sit at the center of a vast ecosystem where data growth continues unabated. In this context, we continue to have multiple opportunities to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. We are working to develop and bring the market innovative solutions in 3 areas: the public and private clouds, thin and light client systems and the Connected Life or personal cloud for homes and small businesses. 
 Specifically, in the cloud environment, demand for our high-capacity drives remained strong. Total cost of ownership is a significant issue for our customers in the high-capacity market, and we have seen broad interest in our new 7 disk helium-filled drive. This innovative solution will deliver 40% energy savings over current offerings. Our expanding portfolio of enterprise class solid state drives continues to gain increasing acceptance with our customers. For the third consecutive quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth with our SSD enterprise drives. 
 In the thin and light category, customers are increasingly deploying our 7-millimeter hard drives, and enthusiasm for our new 5-millimeter and solid state hybrid drive platforms is high. 
 And for the Connected Life, we continue to develop solutions that help consumers manage, store, access and experience their personal and professional content seamlessly. With more ways to create and share content, consumers are increasingly turning to external drives as the best storage choice. For example, we see tablets with USB ports driving adoption of direct attached devices. We are also seeing tablet users increasingly adopt our network attached storage for added capacity. 
 In my new role as the CEO of Western Digital, I am excited to be leading this great company at such a compelling time of change and opportunity in the storage industry. With our HGST and WD teams, we have the people, the platform, the technology and the financial engine to innovate and address changing customer needs.  We will continue to lead by innovating, executing and allocating capital in a thoughtful way. 
 Wolfgang will now provide our report on Q2 and our outlook for Q3. 
Wolfgang Nickl: Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize the total market demand and I'll consolidate the financial performance for the December quarter and then conclude with a range of our expected financial results for the March quarter. 
 The HDD market shipped approximately 136 million units during the December quarter, slightly less than the 140 million units we anticipated in our guidance. We saw continued inventory rebalancing at our OEM customers and our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean. By challenging market conditions, both from a macro and IT perspective, we delivered very strong financial results. 
 Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shipped a total of 59.2 million hard drives. Our average HDD selling price was $62, flat with the prior quarter. Favorable mix offset modest like-for-like price decline. 
 Our gross margin for the quarter was 27.7%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 28.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 70 basis points better than what was implied in our guidance, which was a function of lower-than-anticipated price declines and better-than-expected mix. 
 R&D and SG&A spending totaled $540 million for the December quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. 
 We incurred charges of $41 million in the December quarter reflecting continued discipline in aligning our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we've already incurred charges of $80 million and $26 million in the June and September quarters, respectively.  Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $10 million. 
 Tax expense for the December quarter was $133 million or 28% of pretax income. Tax expense included a one-time charge of $88 million due to the passage of Proposition 39 in California. Without this one-time charge, tax expense would have been $45 million or 8% of non-GAAP pretax income. 
 Our net income for the December quarter totaled $335 million or $1.36 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $513 million or $2.09 per share.
 Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $772 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $526 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $246 million. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be at the upper end of our CapEx model of 5% to 7%, including approximately $200 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. 
 Excluding the flood-related spending, we would be close to the bottom end of our model range. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy announced in September, we repurchased 4.2 million shares for $146 million. As of the end of last quarter, an authorization of $2.4 billion remains available for future repurchase. 
 In addition, we declared the dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60.2 million which we paid on December 26 to shareholders of record as of December 14. On October 15, we also paid out the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60.9 million, which are all declared during the September quarter. 
 We exited fiscal Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.7 billion. 
 I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter.
 We expect a total available market flat to slightly down when compared with the December quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion reflecting the current demand environment, the seasonal change in business mix and the conclusion of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing arrangement with Toshiba. Gross margin of approximately 28% excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $540 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, a tax rate of approximately 7% and a share count of approximately 244 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.80 for the March quarter. 
 Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Steve, Wolfgang, just 2 if I could. I guess the first is on the mix dynamic that you expect to -- you experienced in the December quarter and expect to experience in the March quarter. Can you talk to some of the specifics of what you're seeing. And I mean, I guess to the extent you can talk about what, how, I guess what would you expect kind of as we go through the year, if we should expect what's going to happen in March to extend beyond that, and I have a follow-up. 
Wolfgang Nickl: Ananda, yes, the December quarter was favorable and mixed both from a product mix perspective and also from a business mix perspective. You can see that also from our Investors summary page. Notebook and desktop were combined slightly down when compared to the September quarter, enterprise and branded were up quite a bit. So you can see we had a quite significant positive impact from a business mix, which led to us maintaining the $62 ASP. When you look into the March quarter, you usually see PC sales just seasonally going down by some percentage, probably 6% to 8% if you look at history. And in the branded sales, it's slowing down a little bit after the holiday season. So those are the 2 major impacts that, just from a mix perspective, weigh in on the ASP. 
Ananda Baruah: Got it, okay. And I guess as far as benefit from mix, as you move through the year, your major competitor has kind of been talking about they expect industry mix dynamics to lean more positive as you move through the year both within the books and then also with hybrid being introduced in May. Just interested in getting your thoughts on, I guess, how sudden the mix can be as we go through the year and the impact that could have on the industry business model. 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, I'll take that question. I think that, I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind, I mean, really 2 comments: I mean, one, mix is always a bit of a dynamic thing and it's something that we, from a business standpoint, actively manage to improve our overall financial performance. So there's a lot of, call it, tactical things that we do within a quarter to make sure that we are getting an appropriate amount of mixup with our customers and with our products and that sort of thing. But the other thing that I think that we have to keep in mind, which is a very important point in that the secular changes that are occurring within the industry are actually very favorable from a mix perspective. So clearly, where we've seen pressure from a volume perspective has been on the client space. That traditionally has -- carries a lower ASP, a lower mix. But where we continue to see very solid growth, although at a lower unit number, has been in the higher capacity enterprise space, particularly the cloud. And then not only that, in terms of the branded business or the personal cloud or Connected Life. And so those things, as you move through the year, and not only that but I think as we move forward into the future, we'll continue to benefit our business both from a average selling price perspective or a mix perspective and then accordingly, if we continue to do our jobs appropriately, from an overall margin perspective. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele of Needham & Company. 
Richard Kugele: The yen, the changes in the currency relative to the dollar, did that help or hurt the business in the quarter? And I have a follow-up. 
Wolfgang Nickl: It was a little bit of a help for us on the OpEx side. And going forward, we're including the yen in our hedging program. So it should have minimal impact on ongoing results. 
Richard Kugele: And then in terms of your own procurement from a component perspective over the balance of '13, can you just update us on your own progress on internal production levels or capability? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, we're planning on steady progress and towards the latter end of the year, we'll be in within our purchasing parameters and also mixing into the new areal density. So we're making steady progress there. 
Stephen Milligan: So we have some more work to do. 
Richard Kugele: By the end of the year, do you mean the fiscal year or the calendar? 
Wolfgang Nickl: I think we'll make progress throughout the calendar year. 
Richard Kugele: Okay. And let me just ask one on the OpEx. You guided to $540 million, which is obviously up when you adjust out for the items. Presumably the $540 million is exiting items. So where is the increase sequentially? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, Richard, what we do is, I mean, we talked before that we have a pretty -- focusing on operating our OpEx pretty variable and we have 6  months incentive programs and since -- when we set them on the July time frame, our expectation of total market demand was different. They didn't quite payout at the level that we anticipated originally and that's why we guided to $525 million. Obviously, we performed better than our guidance. So they paid out a little bit higher and then we have the said impact from the yen, well, that will get us to the $529 million. So the $540 million is a bit of progress compared to the $550 million run rate that we referred to earlier, but the main difference is incentive payouts, Rich. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicholas. 
Aaron Rakers: I think you alluded to a little bit of it in the last question, but when I look at your gross margin and I think about it from a COGS per unit basis, it looks like it was up sequentially this last quarter and actually getting close to that, what would be historically a high level. So I guess my question is you mentioned areal density and you'd make progress towards that. Could you talk a little bit about where you're at on that areal density curve and when those yields start to show up? And how maybe we should think about the COGS per unit number as a function of gross margin? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, again, I mean, both Steve and I commented on business mix changes. We got to be really, really careful with the COGS per unit because there's so many different businesses blended in. Again, I'll point you to the enterprise and branded numbers where we disclosed the volume and you'll see that we had pretty good sequential increases there. In terms of the areal density, we have said before, partly due to the flood, we're behind on deploying those. We're nowhere close to being done on this and, again, I don't think we'll make progress there throughout the fiscal year -- calendar year. Steve? 
Stephen Milligan: Aaron, let me add a comment there. I think that relative to -- there's a lot of things that are going on in terms of our cost, and I just want to give you my perspective. One of the things -- and let's be realistic with regards to ourselves. We have seen versus where we were before, and this is an industry statement, a pretty significant decrease in volumes. So if we -- it would be unfair to isolate per se cost opportunities that we have to areal density alone, right? We have -- we obviously have more capacity than what we're producing because we're throttling it to what we see as demand. But we are taking actions to reset our capacity potential to a more appropriate level given what we view the secular changes in terms of the overall demand profile for the industry, not that we don't expect to see growth but not at the same rates than what we've historically done. So the point being is that there are multiple opportunities that we have as an organization to continue to improve our cost structure. And it's an area, it is probably other than innovation and those kinds of things and introducing some of the new products that we've talked about, getting traction in regards to that as we move to the back half of the year, and continuing to improve our cost structure on multiple fronts is one of the larger opportunities that we have as an organization. 
Aaron Rakers: As a follow-up, obviously, there's a lot of talk about hybrids. You talked about 7-millimeter, a lot of interest. Where do you stand on the current 5-millimeter platform? And should we expect those to start to materialize from a volume or design cycle basis by the end of calendar '13? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So what we talked about before and it continues to be the case is that right now what we're doing is we're shipping engineering samples to customers. We're actively engaged with them in terms of working with them as to how to utilize the new form factor as well as the solid state hybrid drive. We're making good progress in that regard. But we don't expect any revenue to materialize until we move into the back half of calendar 2013, with hopefully it being more of a meaningful contributor particularly as we move into 2014, calendar. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw of DISCERN. 
Cindy Shaw: If you could give us an update, I'd appreciate it. You mentioned it. It sounds like you still -- like you've got a better sense of cyclical versus secular. If you could give us some color on any changes in that and how you're feeling about it and then I have a follow-up. 
Stephen Milligan: I think that the 2 secular things that we're really dealing with and, obviously, they're related is, one, reset of overall volumes, and I talked about that earlier. And oh by the way, we talked about it at the Investor Day overall. We are not going to put our head in the sand and disregard the changes that are occurring around us, and so volume levels are lower than what we had seen, call it, pre-flood, and it's not just a flood dynamic obviously. It's changes that we're seeing within the overall IT space. And so we're dealing with that in terms of how we react from that perspective. And then additionally is where we are seeing growth in data and the innovations and the products that are required, and so we're seeing -- and that's when we talk about the 3 areas of investment in terms of the Connected Life, in terms of thin and light, and then as well in terms of the public and private cloud. So we're repositioning and continuing to reposition our roadmap and repositioning our investments to those areas so that we're appropriately optimized in those regards. 
Cindy Shaw: And then as we do look at some of those investment areas, the thin and light, I know expectations are going into the Windows 8 launch were, for many people, quite high. If you could give us any sort of updated view that you might have on that. And also elaborate to Connected Life, if you have done any sort of -- and I know that's historically sort of looking out into this kind [ph] a little bit, but any sort of sense for someone moves up of a PC and onto a tablet, what happens to sort of gigabyte demand if they go to a personal cloud or start storing things in the enterprise? Does that drive demand for more gigabytes or less or how should we think about that? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, I think that in terms of the 5-millimeter, the thing that we have to keep in mind, and this is related to not only the 5-millimeter form factor but also as it relates to solid state hybrid drives, is that there are design windows to work with our customers on. And so we did not -- well first off, product is not generally available or shipping, it's still under development, but we are sampling with our customers. But we also have to hit the design time frames, design windows with our customers, and so that's why I go back to the point that we do not anticipate there being any shipment of those both from a development standpoint and from a design in perspective until the back half of 2013 with an all likelihood of being a more meaningful contributor in 2014. And so that's the 5-millimeter story, but we are encouraged with the progress that we're making and the interest on behalf of our customers. On the Connected Life, I mean, frankly, it's a little bit too early to call out specific data. And so -- but clearly one of the issues that's going on from a tablet perspective, I mean, tablet -- and I alluded to it in our prepared remarks, is that the storage capability on tablets is not that great, but yet the density, particularly, when you're talking about high def kind of content, video content, requires higher storage capacity and so, therefore, particularly as it relates to Win 8 and things like that or Android tablets is that they are USB enabled so that people can store more data on hard drives giving them, enabling them to access content at that higher video quality, thus increasing their experience from a consumer standpoint. But it's difficult to cite specific data as to how that plays out. But fundamentally, our job is to provide solutions to our consumers and to our customers that facilitates more and more data growth, and that's what we're trying to do. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. 
Sherri Scribner: I was hoping you could give us a little bit of detail on the different end markets in the past. I think you've given some comments about how those performed, so I was hoping you can give us some detail on the overall market. 
Wolfgang Nickl: I can give you a few points. Like I said before, if you dissect the 136 for the December quarter, desktop was pretty much like we expected it somewhere in the 44.5 million range. Notebook was a little bit weaker than we expected because there was inventory rebalancing going on, but approximately the same 44.5 million to 45 million units. Enterprise was solid, 2 million quarter-over-quarter and improvement there to 15.5 million. I think, we're mostly through the inventory situation there. So that was solid. CE, which includes gaming, was about 15 million units and then branded products, like we said, and it's also driven by the desire to back up and attach DAS and NAS products was 15.5 million units or so, which was also very solid. And we have performed well in all of these areas. Our company share is about 44% and we have more or less around 40% to 46% in all of these areas. So that's pretty much the market, for example, last quarter. 
Sherri Scribner: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, is there any extra inventory that you see in the various channels? I know you commented that disti is relatively lean, but we've had some inventory overhang. You've made some comments on the different segments. But just wanted to get an overall sense of work done with the inventory. And in the March quarter, do you expect to maintain your share? Or do you expect to lose or gain share? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes. So Sherri, I'll address the inventory and the share question. I think we said that the inventory rebalancing is largely complete, which means that it's not -- it's been reduced. There are small pockets, very small pockets. There's always small pockets where there might be some inventory corrections but nothing that we can tell and we don't have perfect visibility through all of the supply chain because it's not just our inventory or even our customers, it can be customers' inventory in the channel, but we don't believe there's anything meaningful from an inventory perspective. And then share, I mean, obviously our goal is to do the best job we can with our customers. And we believe that if we continue to do a great job with our customers, we're going to continue to do well from a share perspective, and where that leaves us, we'll have to kind of figure that out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland out of Robert Baird. 
Jayson Noland: Steve, you mentioned better visibility, was that a comment on inventory? Or was there something more there? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, I think what was happening, as you go back to the past, I mean, the past several quarters, there was a much more meaningful overhang of inventory. The other thing is that we have to keep in mind is that our customers have been going through a significant product transition in terms of Windows 8, Windows 7, and then you got all the macroeconomic concerns and all the uncertainty associated with that. There wasn't -- I mean, so those things are beginning to lift. Accordingly, that gives us better visibility. 
Jayson Noland: Okay. And there was some talk maybe a quarter or 2 ago about a 600 million TAM for cal '13 is that -- that seems tough, I guess, at this point? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, I mean, in Steve's remarks, he said that the first half of calendar '13 would be roughly flat to slightly down with the second half of calendar year '12, and I think there was 275 million or so. And then we feel cautiously optimistic about the second half of the calendar year, but will it give us a lift to 325? Probably not. So 600 seems like a high number at this point. 
Jayson Noland: Okay. And last question for me, Wolfgang, as data storage slowly drifts towards the cloud in different applications at a different pace, could you talk about your enterprise business and the strength there? Are those cloud buyers or is that traditional enterprise? And what are the expectations going forward? 
Stephen Milligan: Well I think that, I mean, the primary area where we're seeing growth is in high-capacity enterprise and that's really across the board. I mean, obviously, and we don't talk specifically about customers and things like that. But generally, we're seeing strength across the board in that regard and so -- but the performance, traditional performance enterprise, is a pretty stable market, not necessarily anticipating there to be meaningful growth in that regard, but still a great part of the market for us and for the industry. And in terms of how we feel like we're positioned, we feel like we're very well positioned in multiple regards. We talked about where we have our existing products. We're very strong in terms of the enterprise SSD market, not necessarily that material within the whole grand scheme of things but certainly helps us from an overall portfolio perspective with our customers in terms of offering them solutions. And then with the introduction of the helium-filled drive and that innovation, we really feel very, very strong not only about our existing portfolio but about where we're going in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Craig of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Scott Craig: Steve or Wolfgang, can you maybe talk about your utilization you think that you're running the factories at right now and maybe sort of the industry utilization. And then when do you expect to make decisions or the industry make decisions on how you should adjust capacity as you sort of head into the back part of the year. If things don't quite work out, how you're viewing them right now? And then along the lines of the CapEx, Wolfgang, why wouldn't CapEx be below the bottom end of the range given the significant, probably overcapacity, that's in the industry right now? 
Wolfgang Nickl: I'll give you a few pointers and I'll let Steve add on. I mean, as Steve indicated earlier, with the volumes being lower, I mean, despite the fact that we are adjusting our capacity at a reasonable pace, you should assume that we have more capacity than we need at least in certain aspects of our business. It's always a little bit difficult to answer because it's not like one big box that you're utilizing, you have a wafer fab and you have HTA [ph] and you have media, et cetera. But you see that we're very, very active in rightsizing the capacity and I gave you the jobs that we took. So we're doing that in a reasonable, realtime fashion and that's one key contributor how we continue to stay in the margin model. In terms of capital, we're doing a capital spending as realtime as possible. We are focusing our capital spend entirely on areal density progression, on technology advancement, on supply flexibility. For instance, we had only one slide of app [ph] and now we have, I think, 2. So we're not investing in capacity. With the exception of test, as we move more into these capacity enterprise rise, they just require a longer test time, and those are the key components that made our capital spending, and we continue to do what we have always done. We will manage this very, very tightly and realtime. 
Operator: It comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. 
Steven Fox: Just 2 quick questions from me. Given the strength on the branded business in the fourth quarter and given how the floods may have affected your production during the year, is there any chance that may be you left some money on the table in terms of consumer demand with branded? And if so, is there any -- how would that impact this calendar year? And then secondly, just a little bit more color on enterprise, if possible. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you're seeing enterprise demand that is seasonally in line with expectations above, below. Any kind of color there would help. 
Stephen Milligan: Can you clarify the question on leaving money on the table. I wasn't quite sure I... 
Steven Fox: Well, I'm wondering if you were able to meet demand on branded products across all your retail partners or whether maybe there was more demand at the end of the year that maybe you anticipated. 
Stephen Milligan: I don't believe that was any issues with that, not to my knowledge. But if you know of anything, we'd be happy to support it. So and then I'm sorry, now, I got distracted on the second part of the question. 
Steven Fox: Yes, that's okay. I'm just trying to understand the March quarter seasonality on the enterprise class drives especially high-capacity drives. Are you seeing typical seasonality from your enterprise customers? Or is it better or worse start to the year? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, in general, what we expect for the March quarter, flat to slightly up. But again, if you look at this in the midterm, the capacity enterprise is what we believe is going to grow double-digit and the performance enterprise is more growing with the GDP at a lower rate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO. 
Keith Bachman: The first is on pricing. Within the guidance you've provided for the March quarter, could you talk specifically about what your expectations are for pricing. And then more importantly, as to extend Ananda's question, as you're thinking about the next couple of quarters, how are you thinking all the various forces will impact your pricing assumptions? 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes. Like-for-like modest declines. It's still a competitive market. Our absolute price will be impacted by segment mix, and then going forward, it's a little bit tough to tell. I mean, we're looking at where we are as it relates to our business model and we're committed to be in the 27% to 32% range and that will govern our pricing. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. Well, any responses -- Seagate specifically talked about pricing. They think it could indeed be flat sequentially for the next couple of quarters. Any reaction to those comments, specifically? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, I mean, you have to ask Seagate about that. I mean, obviously, we're trying to manage all the variables that we have, including pricing, to continue to improve our overall business performance and that sort of thing. We factored in some assumptions in terms of what will happen, and we'll have to see how that plays out in terms of how we move through the quarter, but I'm not going to comment specifically on Seagate's pricing. 
Keith Bachman: Okay. Then more broadly my follow-up question, if I could, is you provided gross margin color for the near term March quarter. Could you just help us think about as you look, say, the June quarter or even within the March quarter, what are the -- outside of the pricing, what are the key areas that we should be really focused on or that you guys were focused on between mix and restructuring at Hitachi and the demand that would impact the gross margin to keep within the range that you've talked about? 
Stephen Milligan: Well, I think that there are a few key things. I mean, first off, we will be very careful about what business we take and what business we don't take and that sort of thing, so being selective within reason with regards to that. The other thing is to continue to manage our operations very closely from a cost and efficiency perspective and then particularly continuing to make improvements there. That's a very big opportunity for us across the board. And then the last thing which is what benefited this quarter is to continue to push our mix, both in terms of the capacity mix that we're shipping and selling but also in terms of the segment mix that we have overall. And again we do believe that the secular trends in that regard are moving in a positive direction. So we've got a little bit of wind at our back, if you want to call it that, in regards to that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insight Research. 
Nehal Chokshi: So in the industry segment detail that you gave us, looks like the enterprise hard drive segment increased about 15% Q-over-Q and your own enterprise hard drives increased 11% Q-over-Q. So can you just discuss what was the driver for the underperformance relative to the industry. And if possible, can you give us some additional detail on a subsegment basis on the relative performance. And I have another question about the Arkeia acquisition. 
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, I mean, on the enterprise, and we gave you rough numbers. Our enterprise market participation was as expected. There's always a little puts and takes, but our share is more or less flattish quarter-over-quarter. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. So this Arkeia acquisition looks like a nice acquisition that can build some value in the SMB segment and start to blur the lines at some of your enterprise customers. But in order to successfully do that, I think that you're going to have to build the brand value of Arkeia. So is that the intention of that acquisition? And if it is, can you discuss the investment that Western Digital is willing to make in order to build that value, that brand value, to realize full potential of this acquisition? 
Stephen Milligan: First off, it was not a significant acquisition from a dollar amount perspective, but it does add the building block to our product capability in the SMB market and so really what we're trying to do is continue to improve our offering. And obviously, as we improve our offering, we're going to have to make other investments, prudent investments, to increase our presence in that marketplace. But this is -- we're just continuing to take it a step at a time in terms of enhancing our competitive position in that marketplace. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital. 
Eric Sterling: This is Eric Sterling for Ben Reitzes. In light of your expectations for demand in the first half of the calendar year, are you backing away from the $10 EPS target that you had put out earlier in the year? 
Wolfgang Nickl: That's a good -- that's a safe assumption, yes. I mean, we expect the $10 EPS target in the July time frame and at that time we were anticipating what we thought was -- frankly, was conservative for 5% growth in the market, which would have gotten you to some 630 million for the fiscal year. And when you do the math now based on what I -- what Steve said earlier, we'll probably land somewhere on 550 million, that's a very, very significant reduction in volume. What we have achieved with everything else was the product offering we achieved the gross margin models. But with a TAM that low, it's unrealistic and you can do the math, what we would have to achieve in Q4 so we don't think that's realistic anymore. 
Eric Sterling: Right. And in terms of buybacks for the March quarter, how should we think about that? 
Wolfgang Nickl: That's just -- we're executing to our capital allocation strategy which, as a reminder, called for 50% of the free cash flow to be spent on share buybacks and dividends, and we're going to execute into those metrics. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Cihra from Evercore Partners. 
Robert Cihra: Two questions, if I could. One, Steve, you had talked about the visibility getting better now that inventories have been worked down, which makes sense because at least you get a truer view in the demand. But can you talk about your OEM customer visibility? My sense is that they don't normally have a lot of visibility this time of the year, and that this year it may even be worse than usual. I mean, do you get a sense that they have any visibility past, say, February. And are your comments of visibility actually implying that maybe their visibility is starting to get a little better here too or where do they look. And then separate from that, just a question on branded, your branded business is getting back to where it was pre-flood. You said inventories were lean there. Wondering if you're still sort of catching up, if you've caught up? And what do we need to see to get that market back to being a good growth market like it had been pre-flood? 
Stephen Milligan: I think it's difficult for me to comment specifically on the customers have better visibility. I mean, the reality of things from a customer perspective is that there's still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, conservatism, if you want to call it that. I mean, it's been a tough year and there's a lot of transitions going on but I think that -- and obviously there are, and this is always true, but maybe particularly given now there's always winners and losers, if you want to call it that, and so depends upon who you talk to and their level of confidence. But I think when we evaluate demand, we obviously don't, and no disrespect to our customers, we don't just listen to our customers. There's lots of things we triangulate to try to get a sense for where we think things are going to fall out. And it's those things, coupled with conversations with customers and to your point, the easing of the inventory overhang that gives us increased visibility and confidence with regards to how we see things playing out. 
Wolfgang Nickl: And I can answer the branded question. I mean, last quarter, the market for branded was higher than pre-flood. So that market was totally recovered and if you recall from our September Analyst Day and Investor Day, branded is clearly one of the areas along with capacity enterprise where we believe we will see solid growth for the coming years, both on the DAS and the NAS side and that's driven by the desire and need to backup and, it's also driven by the data growth in general. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller of Noble Financial Capital Market. 
Mark Miller: One thing that you seem to be a doing a very good job on is keeping your markets up, ASPs were flat this quarter, the channel has also been lean as you noted. Is there reason to believe there are other factors just besides behaving well in terms of internal cost cuts and reducing your cost per prime unit that will also support higher margins in 2013? I know they went up significantly after the acquisition of Hitachi, but there were a lot of moving parts there with the flood, and I was expecting I think you said we can't expect that to come down. 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, I think, Mark, just to kind of comment on that, there's always multiple levers that we have to influence our business outcome. And I know that a lot of times the market, and I'm referring to, call it, Wall Street in this case, will focused on one particular variable or what have you or whether it be demand, or it be pricing data points that are out there and say, well, you know, margins must be going down or this creates this kind of problem. And we obviously have a very holistic way in terms of the way that we manage our business and a lot of levers that we can pull, including improving our cost, improving our mix. The selection of what business we accept or don't accept with our customers and then obviously pricing. So there's lots of different things that we can do. And to your indication or to your point, we do believe that we've done a reasonably good job, and that's reflected in our gross margin performance and not only that, our guidance, and we expect to continue to do that going forward. And that's why we've stated the fact that we're confident that we're going to continue to stay within this gross margin range of 27 to 32, and that it's not just a set of aspirational goals. It's the way that we're going to manage the business. 
Mark Miller: Because of the flood, your competitor signed up a number of its customers to long-term agreements, and it seems to me a lot of these agreements should be patiently done with. And I'm just wondering are these agreements expiring or are there opportunities for you as these agreements expire or these agreements are still -- some of these agreements are extending well into 2013? 
Stephen Milligan: Yes, just to correct one thing, Mark. We did not sign or have a lot of -- we didn't have any meaningful, if you want to call it, LTAs with our customers. So this is based upon -- there's no contractual lockup, if you want to call it here, that's compelling our customers to pay us higher prices than otherwise they would desire. This is just good old hard work in the way that we're dealing with our customers and how we're managing our business. 
Mark Miller: Well my point was more with your competitor, which had stated... 
Stephen Milligan: I'm sorry, with our competitor. Yes, I mean, those have been expired. We don't have all the details, but they've been expiring over time and you'd have to ask Seagate more details about it.
 All right, I'd like to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance and our customers and our suppliers for their support. We look forward to being in touch with you. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Robert Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I would like to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, our position in the industry, our investment in capital allocation plans, HDD demand for the December quarter and fiscal 2013 and our financial results expectations for the September quarter and fiscal 2013. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures that we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the dilutive impact of sales of drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer John Coyne.
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I have with me our President, Steve Milligan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. In this, my last earnings call, I'm happy to report another quarter of strong financial performance, continuing our track record of consistent execution. During my 6-year tenure as CEO, we have experienced and successfully addressed many different challenges and opportunities. Throughout, we have continued to hone our time-tested and flexible business model, delivering outstanding returns and value under varying scenarios. The results include a doubling of market share, a tripling of revenue and a fivefold increase in profits. I'm proud of this sustained performance by the team, and I'm confident as I pass the leadership of the company to Steve, ably supported by Tim Leyden, Mike Cordano and Wolfgang, that they will continue to build on that momentum. While the macroeconomic environment is dampening near-term demand, we remain confident in the continued long-term growth in the creation, storage and management of digital content. This is being seen in every aspect of our lives, and monetizing it provides a compelling long-term opportunity for the company. We have built strong relationships with customers in all of our markets by consistently delighting them with high-quality, reliable products based on superior technology and delivered through the industry's most efficient supply chain. We have developed a tremendously broad product portfolio, great depth and breadth in our people and technology resources and a powerful platform. Western Digital has never been better positioned to succeed as it continues to thrive on change and deliver great value to all its constituents. I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, our supply partners and our investors for their support, and I especially want to thank our employees around the world who have consistently delivered such outstanding performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Milligan.
Stephen D. Milligan: Thanks, John. We are very pleased to report strong financial results for our September quarter, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver value under varying market conditions. There are several dynamics currently limiting market demand: first, global macroeconomic weakness, which is impacting overall IT spending; second, product transitions in the PC industry; and third, the continued adoption of tablets and smartphones, which is muting PC sales growth. These headwinds notwithstanding, the Western Digital team remains focused on creating outstanding economic value, building on our strong multiyear track record. There is a tremendous opportunity as we innovate and enable customers to store, manage and connect the massive and growing amounts of digital data in their personal and professional lives. This opportunity extends well into the future. Looking across our markets, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse, resulting in greater market segmentation. Computing is no longer a general purpose proposition, and that evolution plays to the strengths of Western Digital with our technology breadth, people and product portfolio. Currently, we are focused on 3 key initiatives to broaden our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers, enabling continued value creation: first, the delivery of innovative and cost-effective storage products, including hybrid drives for thin and light mobile devices; second, a portfolio of enterprise products that fit the varying needs of the public and private cloud environments, including high-performance SSD systems and high-performance and large-capacity hard drives with the lowest total cost of ownership; third, providing easy-to-use integrated solutions for the personal cloud environment and our connected lives. We have received very positive customer feedback on our latest differentiated solutions to address these trends. All major PC OEMs have shown strong interest in our 5-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid designs as an alternative to solid-state and dual drive configurations. In the cloud environment, our new 7-disk high-capacity sealed drive announcement has been extremely well received, confirming the need to seek better total cost of ownership solutions for this growing market. For the Connected Life, we introduced today the My Passport Enterprise, one of the industry's first portable hard drives designed specifically for use with Microsoft's Windows To Go, enabling corporate customers to provision a fully featured Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive. For fiscal 2013, we remain focused on realizing the $10 EPS target established in July of this year despite a significant change in the underlying industry growth assumptions. We will continue to manage closely those aspects of our business that we control, namely delighting our customers, executing to our product roadmap, remaining diligent with regards to managing costs and expenses and strategically allocating our capital. Looking forward, I am very excited about the future of Western Digital. We have the people, platform, technology and financial resources to continue to invest in growth opportunities while at the same time, returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Wolfgang will now provide a report on our Q1 performance and our Q2 outlook.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shifted total of 62.5 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $62. OEM sales represented 63% of revenue; distribution channel sales, 24%; and retail sales, 13%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%. Our R&D and SG&A spending totaled $575 million for the September quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. In order to align our production with anticipated market demand, we incurred charges of $26 million in the September quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $14 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $59 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $519 million or $2.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or $2.36 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $936 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $554 million. We used $218 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares. As of the end of September, an authorization of $2.6 billion remains available for future repurchases. We declared the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $61 million, which we paid on October 15 to shareholders of record as of September 28. We exited fiscal Q1 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, of which $826 million was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.4 billion. I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect a total available market of approximately 140 million units; revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting the muted demand environment, a seasonal reduction in our gaming business and a planned reduction of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing for Toshiba; gross margin of approximately 28%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, which is within our new business model despite continued cost challenges stemming from the floods in Thailand last year. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $525 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 248 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.85 for the December quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First, I wanted to ask Steve about macro cyclical and secular. I know it's tough to divide that up, Steve. But if you could talk about how much of this is secular versus cyclical assuming the macro comes back or gets better next year. Just some more color there.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. I mean, Jason, you kind of hit the nail on the head. I think that it's a difficult question to answer. I mean, we've got -- I mean, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, there's a lot of different factors at play. Clearly, the global macroeconomic environment, I mean -- and it's not just the IT industry, but there's a lot of headwinds in terms of what's happening on a global basis. Additionally, the IT segment is not immune to that. So we've seen other announcements come out that have talked about weakness in terms of overall IT spending. And then clearly, the PC industry is weak, right? And some of that is due to product transitions with Windows 8. But undoubtedly, there is an impact, as we're seeing, if you want to call it cannibalization in terms of tablets and smartphones or other kind of connected devices. And I think the important thing to really refer to is when we had our Investor Day, we talked about a longer-term growth rate in the HDD industry of 3%. When we put that together, we attempted as best as possible to estimate the impact of all these different factors. And right now, we don't see a reason to alter that 3% longer-term growth rate in terms of number of hard drives sold.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And Wolfgang, you maintained $10 for the full year. You must be assuming gross margins come up off that 28% level in the second half of the year, fiscal year?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, Jason. I mean, $10 is the target and remains the target. Our complete focus is on the items that we control or at least influence. We're focusing heavily on cost. We're focusing on OpEx and spending. We somewhat impact the share count as well and obviously try to optimize volume price mix decision. So we're focusing on what we control or influence. We have made an assumption when we originally stated the $10 target in July, I believe, yes, in July, that we assumed the TAM to increase by 5%. And if you do the math, that would be a TAM of 630 million units. And with the first 2 quarters at 139 and 140, respectively, we need a bit of an uptick in the second half of the fiscal year to continue to be able to do the target. I believe that we'll get in the 600 range. It's very doable. And like we said, we focus on the levels that we control. And it remains a target, and that's what we're shooting for.
Operator: Next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Wondering within the product mix in the quarter, if you could give us maybe any more color both within PC but even more so, I guess, on enterprise. How much of that decline in the quarter and that you're expecting again do you think is inventory drawdown versus actual slowdown in demand? And again, maybe perhaps more so on the enterprise side given the fact that we kind of already know that PCs have been weak, but any view you have in the enterprise demand, what it's looking like?
John F. Coyne: Sure, Rob. In the enterprise space, there's a couple of different dynamics going on. First thing is if you go back to the floods, really a couple of different things there. First off, the enterprise segment was the one segment that was least impacted from a drive output perspective as it relates to the floods. We all -- the various different companies independently did as much as we could to protect the supply in that critical part of the market. Nevertheless, our customers, because of concerns about shortages, I would say, bought ahead from a demand perspective in order to protect themselves in that segment. Additionally, if you look at some of the impact of the LTA contracts that were out there, that also resulted in customers purchasing ahead from a supply perspective ahead of the demand. And then, sure, we have seen some slowdown in terms of end-user demand, if you want to refer to it that way. But fundamentally, the overall dynamics in the enterprise space remain positive as we're seeing substantial data growth and build-out of infrastructures from that perspective. However, in terms of the units that we shipped as an industry and we shipped as a company, we are seeing the impact of that inventory correction roll through the latest quarter. And hopefully, we'll be able to work our way through it as we finish out the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Steve Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: Just a couple of quick clarifications. Just on the $10 target, just to return to that for a second. If you're talking about potentially doing 600 million units as sort of the bogey, what would be the levers that you think you can most control, putting aside capital allocation? Would it be more on the expense side? Or would it be shipping new products sooner than maybe has been advertised, et cetera? And then secondly, is there any other mix issues that we should think of maybe over the next couple of quarters within the segments in terms of average capacity, within notebooks versus hard -- versus desktops, et cetera, as we model out?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, Steve, the biggest lever is clearly cost. And we're assuming a standard mix between the segments in our forecast.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. I would just add to that, and I mean, certainly what we can do on the cost and expense side, it's always important to manage that in a diligent fashion. But our #1 priority is to continue to take care of our customers because if we can earn their trust and continue to earn their business, that helps provide the runway for stronger financial results for us.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: And just real quick to clarify, in terms of any kind of excess inventories you're looking at, there's no emphasis on one type of capacity versus another? You're saying it's pretty broad based?
Stephen D. Milligan: I think that's a good assumption.
Operator: Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So first question is sticking to the topic of the inventory, when I look at your finished goods inventory build, standing at 508 million, how do we think about that in the context of gross margin? How does that build flow through the gross margin? And how should we think about that line item in reflection of the 28% gross margin going forward? Have you -- I guess another way of putting it, have you aggressively pulled back on your production to see that finished goods inventory come down here going forward?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I mean, first of all, the number is up a little bit, and that has to do with us resuming ocean shipment in both subs, and it also has to do that we were very, very focused on not overshipping to the market at the end of the quarter. In terms of its impact on the 28%, it has an impact in a sense that if you walk this inventory down a little bit, you build less drives in the December quarter. And one of the impacts is absorption, the fewer drives you build. And we mentioned the gaming effect, and we mentioned the Toshiba effect. And the fewer drives you build in a quarter, the more challenging it is to get to your cost objective. So from that perspective, coming in with a bit of a higher inventory makes it certainly more difficult to get to the gross margin. And it had a bit of a contribution to the quarter-over-quarter decline.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up somewhat tied to that but more importantly looking forward. As I think about the levers in your model and we think about it from a, let's say, COGS per unit basis, you're still running about $45 COGS per unit. I know prior to Hitachi, you were running closer to the mid-30, high-30 range. How do we think about that in the context of getting back to normalized internal versus external heads? And then also, where do we stand on the aerial density transition?
John F. Coyne: Yes. I'm going to give a general comment to that, Aaron. I think that one of the things that -- and I certainly don't mean this in a defensive way, but one of the real optimistic parts of our numbers, we put a range out there of 27 to 32 in terms of gross margins. First thing is that you would expect that the low end of that margin model would have a higher likelihood of hitting when you're in adverse market conditions, right? So we're at 28%. And the other thing is that if you look at some of the issues that we're facing from a cost perspective and you get at the absorption issues, and not only that, we're still working to get back into a pre-flood cost level, frankly, at some level at those subs, and then you also look at the dislocation in terms of absorption, it's kind of a sub-point that as we transition out of this Toshiba contract manufacturing situation, we've got to rebalance our factories on the HGST side to do that in a more cost-effective way. You start thinking about that in the context of that 28%. It actually makes that number look a lot more -- look a lot better than what the headline might allude to.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: And in terms of the aerial density transition, we won't provide any particular numbers on that, but I can tell you, that we're on the very early stages. And as we cut over to the new aerial density, that certainly helps us achieve our target cost as well.
Operator: Next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the competitive landscape within the enterprise side of the business, where the market share sort of settled out this quarter and how you're thinking about that in your forecast for the December quarter and for the full fiscal year.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So Bill, I'll take that. This is Steve. I think that we have done -- and this is really on both sides but certainly particularly on the HGST side, we have worked very hard over, frankly, several quarters to, one, fill out our product portfolio, and not only that, provide a more compelling value equation for our customers certainly in terms of the way that our products function, quality levels, et cetera, et cetera. And as a result of that, we've been fortunate enough to gain a meaningful amount of market share. And we continue to expect to maintain that level. In the past quarter, there were some puts and takes in terms of the different elements of that. We maybe lost a slight bit of share in certain segments, but we continue to get -- to not only maintain our momentum but hopefully, if we can continue to do our job, increase our momentum in that space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: For the near-line segment, can you first give us what the units were for that? And then secondly, can you try to help us separate out how the enterprise portion of the near-line demand trended, clearly that was not very positive, and how the cloud portion of near-line demand trended? And then I have a follow-up question as well.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I'll give you the numbers. The TAM was just shy of 7 million units, which was down quarter-over-quarter. And we're not breaking out our specific details between performance and capacity enterprise shipments.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So if you look at it from a demand perspective, both the traditional performance segment and the capacity enterprise segment were affected by the inventory overhang that we spoke of -- that I spoke of earlier. I would say, and this is our view, that the inventory adjustment and the capacity enterprise space is behind us. And we expect some modest growth in that segment here in the calendar Q4. Now just to remind everybody, the demand in that segment, and this is maybe becoming a little bit less so than in the past, but it tends to be a little bit more project based, so it can be a little bit lumpy. But we are anticipating some modest growth here in the final quarter of the calendar year.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Okay. And then could you just discuss the drivers of expected sequential decline in gross margin? Is that purely mix? Or does that have something to do with the higher cost components here?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. I'll take a crack at that, Nehal. First of all, and I think Steve mentioned it earlier, we have a range of, in our gross margin model, 27% to 32% that provides that at certain times, we have different utilizations, our different points with product transitions, et cetera. But for this quarter-over-quarter decline, it is mainly a cost issue stemming from some more under absorption. We mentioned the gaming business. We mentioned the Toshiba business. There is also some price alignment in there, some quarter-over-quarter price takedowns. But we're actually fairly happy with the fact that given the macro headwinds and the demand situation that we can be well within our business model.
Operator: The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I have 2 also. If you go back and just speak to the difference, you're guiding the 10 to be flat sequentially and revenues to be down quite materially sequentially. Could you talk about your pricing assumptions versus the mix assumptions and plus with that revenue guidance, please? And then I have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. There's really 3 factors, Keith, that contribute to the revenue down. First is the gaming business, and that's a project-based business as well. And that's a couple of million units going down quarter-over-quarter. The contract manufacturing for Toshiba on the 3.5-inch divestiture really peaked last quarter, and it's quite a bit down as well. And then there are some price adjustments in the quarter-over-quarter price declines. It's really tough to put exact percentages, but you should think about it roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Any comments on what you think like-for-like pricing will be?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: No, we don't -- we'll not spec that out.
Stephen D. Milligan: I think, if you want to -- I mean, Keith, I'll add a little bit of color there. I mean, we -- it continues to be a competitive marketplace, and we've asserted that for a long time. But in terms of pricing behavior, I would not characterize anything that we're seeing as anything out of balance, or here's another word, irrational.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, okay, great. My follow-up though, if I could sneak that in. I may be over my quota, but just what are the conditions that would enable the TAM to be up in the March quarter, which is implicit within the 600 number, 600-million-unit number. I'm a little surprised, and I'm not sure how we get there. Are you assuming within that a big 8 bounce, a Windows 8 bounce?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, I'm not sure that we know how to get there either. I mean, we're, I mean -- but I think that you'd have to see one of a few different things. One thing working in our industry's favor, potentially, is we can get some of this inventory adjustment stuff behind us. That certainly has been suppressing our TAM. And we, in terms of our company and what we're trying to do, we don't want to carry that over. We'd like to see that adjustment work its way through as soon as possible. And we don't want to push on that string. Additionally, it would be nice to see some improvement in the macroeconomic environment, whether that happens to be some certainty in -- and I mean, you guys know all of this, but we've got elections, we've got changes of government, we've got fiscal cliff, et cetera, et cetera, right, lots of different things that undoubtedly are impacting spending at a corporate and a consumer level. So I think that some clarity on those kind of activities would be helpful. And then also, it would be nice to see some excitement around Windows 8. We're actually relatively -- when I say bullish, I mean, maybe people are looking for good news, but my experience, I think it's got some excitement to it. And I think the thing that has really lacked is that we've got to create some more excitement around the products out there. And we're trying to do our best in terms of some of these hybrid designs and smaller form factor designs that maybe enable our customers to have a little bit of excitement back to the product set.
Operator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the last conversation. Just curious, any more specifics you may have around now that we're days away from the Win 8 launch, when we might see an uptick in hybrid or the thin HDD shipments with some of the new form factors that are planning to come to market.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So when we talked about our hybrid designs, I mean, what we're doing right now is we are providing engineering samples to our customers. And then in the first half of calendar 2013, we will be supplying call samples and gearing up for volume kind of activity the back half of 2013. So we have to watch our traction and our continued ability to execute from an engineering standpoint. And so we're still a bit far away, but so far, the response from our customers has been encouraging.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And it sounds like that lines up with the second iteration of thin and light Win 8 products that we'd get after the Intel Haswell launch in the second quarter next year.
Stephen D. Milligan: Correct, correct.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick clarification. There was a big jump in CE units in the September quarter. I know gaming has come up a number of times. But can you just talk about what drove that incremental 4 million units and how much of that you would expect to give back in the next few quarters?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Well, the upside was [indiscernible] by gaming, and it's a very seasonal business. And I won't give you an exact number, but it's several million that can go up and down in a given quarter.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just wanted to revisit the cost cutting and the reduced operating expenses. Wolfgang, I don't know if I got this number right. But I think you've guided to $525 million for operating expenses for the December quarter, which is down about $40 million. I wanted to get a sense of where you think you can take those cost actions. Is that reducing some of your R&D? Clearly, you'll have to do something in SG&A. And then just trying to get a sense of what type of percentage you expect R&D to be as a percent of sales as we move forward.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. So let me state first, we are not cutting R&D at this point. I mean, where we're cutting costs out from the $550 million level is in discretionary spending. And we have also some of our variable pay programs that are not paying at the historical level. In terms of R&D in total, it's about 70% of our OpEx. But if you're operating right now at about 14%, 15%, you're close to 10% on R&D. Once we get in the future and our target model of 10% to 12%, it would be around 8%.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, 8%. And then thinking about investments as we move forward in terms of CapEx spending, what are your expectations for investments and adding new equipment as we move forward? It looks like we kind of peaked the CapEx here at 382 in the September quarter. I would assume that would go down. And how much capacity would you be expecting to add over the next couple of quarters?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. I mean, first of all, I think you're right, the 382 is probably a peak. I want to remind you that we report CapEx on a cash basis, so the 382 includes flood-related spending that was actually for capital that was received in Q4. With that, before that, in total, we expect for flood recovery about $400 million, for which approximately half will be in fiscal year '13. Our spending is focused on a couple of things. We're obviously investing in technology ramp. We're investing in process improvements and product transitions, and we're also investing in security of the supply chain and flexibility. We're investing almost nothing in capacity other than what is required to transition the line from an older generation to a newer generation. We expect that we will be well within our business model of 5% to 7%, if you take out the flood-related spending at the lower end or possibly the lower end of the model.
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My first question is just with regard to the inventory that you talked about in the industry. Did you quantify that? And any idea on when that is lifted and why it's there? A little more detail on that.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, we did not quantify it, and it would be speculation to try to actually estimate it. But we -- now it obviously depends upon we're one player, granted a big player in the industry. And also, it is -- we've got customers and their behavior. But our intent would be to try to eliminate that inventory overhang here before we exit calendar 2012.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: And it's also important, Ben, the -- we continue to operate the channel in an extremely clean fashion. The distribution inventory, including in transit, is significantly less than 3 weeks -- excuse me, 4 weeks.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just my follow-up's real quick on share repurchase. If you take your $10 guidance as literal, it means about $3 in earnings probably in the March and June quarters. I mean, is there any thought about accelerating share repurchase now so that you have a lower share count for when you have to hit those numbers? Or I guess my question is why not buy back more now and front-load the year with regard to returning your 50% or however much of that goes to buybacks now versus later?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: It's certainly one of the levels available to us, and we're exploring that.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan Chase.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just building on Ben's question there around the $10 target, I had a question in terms of the 3 initiatives that Steve mentioned earlier in the call. Are those tantamount or necessary to get to that $10 target? Do you need those to step down as buffers to some of these other dynamics around cannibalization of PCs from smartphones and tablets and other stuff?
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, I think if you go back, Mark, and you look at what we've talked about in terms of hybrid drive, as well as the helium drive, I assume that's what you're referring to, both of those are not expected to contribute materially to our financial results until the back half of 2013, calendar 2013. But obviously, we need to continue to execute on our broader product roadmap, bring on improvements in terms of our execution against aerial density curves, all those different kinds of things.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then my follow-up question is related to the inventory overhang. Do you think the inventory overhang was driven by some of these long-term agreements that were signed with your competitor earlier this year and that they went to maybe a selective supply chain or bridge here from some of the OEMs and that's what we're having to clean out?
Stephen D. Milligan: That certainly contributed to it, yes, Mark.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then maybe as a last follow-up. As a result of those long-term agreements probably ending here pretty soon, have you seen increased discussions certainly from the server and storage OEMs to do more and more business with Western Digital going forward? Because I know a lot of OEMs are kind of disappointed how Seagate did take advantage of that unfortunate situation in Thailand last year.
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, I think that we talked about it earlier in terms of what we've done in the enterprise segment, and I think there's a lot of different dynamics. The commercial aspect of the relationship is only one aspect. There's also the product aspect, quality aspect, just how you deal with the relationship. So I don't -- I think it's difficult to isolate one particular variable. And what we really have been focused on, frankly, for quite a while is building longer-term endearing relationships with our customers. And we're going to continue to do that.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And thank you, John, for your consistent execution and messaging over the years. Really appreciated it.
John F. Coyne: Thank you very much.
Operator: Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Market.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I also like to add that sentiment, John. You've done a very good job with this firm. I guess the question that everyone has, and I know you were asked this before. But there are scenarios out there saying that there is currently production constraints or shortages of flash chips, and with the fabs that are going up, it's going to be hard for flash and then solid state drives to keep on taking -- to keep on cannibalizing drive and PC sales at the rate they've been doing over the last couple of years. Do you agree or disagree with that?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think that -- I'm not sure I agree or disagree. I think that there's a lot of different dynamics that are going on. And I think that demand is down for a lot of different reasons, and to try to isolate it to -- it's not so much that SSD, or solid state, is taking over the world right now. Demand just isn't very good across the board. And so I think that we've got to look at it in a broader context. Yes, there is some impact, but I don't think that, that's the only dynamic that's occurring.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Well, just to follow up on that question. I believe Stephen Luczo said it during their Investor Day that he actually thought that the macroenvironment as well as the product transitions were having a bigger effect on demand and tablet cannibalization. Do you agree or disagree with that?
John F. Coyne: I think that's a fair statement. I would tend to agree with that.
Stephen D. Milligan: That concludes today's call. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your questions and look forward to being in touch in the months ahead through our investor relations activities. I want to finish with an expression of thanks, admiration and congratulations to John Coyne for his 30 years of dedicated service to Western Digital, including the last 6 as CEO. He and his team have put Western Digital on a course to create significant additional value for our customers and employees and shareholders in the years ahead. I look forward to being part of that next phase in the company's rich history.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth in the storage industry, hard-drive demand from the September quarter and fiscal '13 and our financial results expectations for the September quarter and fiscal '13. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 9, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the diluted impact of sales of drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I'll now turn the call over to Western Digital's Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings. Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows. In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors: We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and a modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%. We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers' continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure, by ramping newer areal density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and the recovery from flood-related cost issues. Taking all this into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13. Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe: In entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments in faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance. Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?
Stephen D. Milligan: Thanks, John. When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point. Both WD and HGST have a heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business. We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8 billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their build plans to the prevailing demand environment. We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million terabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market; 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop; 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications; and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units including solid state drives, media players and routers. It is worth noting that our aggregate shipments of nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrates continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space. As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post-flood downturn with exciting new products. On the operations front, WD began production in its new slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and both subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels. It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers including some important new market entries: Specifically, the WD branded products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless home networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD 2go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration. On the component side, WD introduced its WD Red series, the industry's first hard drives specifically designed for home and small office NAS systems. To address demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first-mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of these particular drives have shipped since product inception. Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated the industry's first 12 gigabit per second SAS solid state drive. In a departure from Western Digital's long-standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan on providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter. The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance. OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx versus our guidance reflect higher attainments on our variable compensation program. In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains on investments. Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditures. Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory, or 11 turns, and 77 days payables. Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 totaled $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million. During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares. As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases. We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars results in a net cash balance of $1 billion. I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter: We expect TAM to be flat with the prior quarter; revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion; gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba; R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles, as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 253 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: First question. As we think about the $10 number that you're now throwing around out there and you talk about the lack of synergies due to the MOFCOM regulatory requirements, relative to your $550 million OpEx guide that you've laid out, can you help us understand what that $10 number reflects as far as how we should think about the OpEx without any synergies in the model? Put another way, is $550 million the high watermark, is that how we should model kind of quarterly OpEx to get to that $10 number?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Aaron, let me give you a bit more context and summarize what we said. The base assumption is a market that's growing approximately 5% from a unit volume perspective. We anticipate our share to be roughly flat in the fiscal year. From an OpEx perspective, like John and I mentioned, we do not expect synergies when compared with the current level of OpEx, might be up or down a little bit. But in average, you should assume what we guided for in Q1. As it relates to the tax rate, I think the 8.5% that we gave you for Q1 is probably a good proxy for the year as well. We're planning to change our approach to share repurchases, where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases. And when you compute all these numbers together, you're coming to a gross margin that's roughly about 30%, give or take. So those are the major assumptions. But from an OpEx perspective, you should assume the OpEx to be roughly flat with what we guided for.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow up, if my math is correct, it looks like you guys were averaged blended capacity per drive of roughly 150 gigabytes. Can you talk about that relative to where that compares to the overall industry. Are you back to normal or is there a little bit more to come as far as returning back to a normal industry average capacity per drive perspective?
John F. Coyne: Well, the number was actually 681.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, my math's wrong.
John F. Coyne: Okay. And that is pretty much back into industry mix.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: In terms of just understanding then your ability to produce using your own heads, John, are you where you want to be internally or do you think that it will be a couple more quarters? You said, you brought the Malaysian facility online, but is it back to where you want in terms of an internal versus external mix?
Stephen D. Milligan: I think -- Rich, I'll take that. This is Steve. But I think that -- we've obviously got different fosters, if you want to call it that, depending upon which subsidiary you're talking about. HGST has filed with a model of whether it will be 80%, 90% internal, 10%, 20% external purchases. WD has got kind of a similar model. Obviously, that became overweighted in terms of the recovery from the flood. And as John and Wolfgang alluded to, we've still got a variety of different things that we need to do as an organization to get to pre-flood kind of levels from a cost perspective. And certainly returning to that kind of blend will be something that we'll be looking to do as we progress into the future.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just, Wolfgang, in terms of the Toshiba comment about the drag on gross margins, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how that works. Are you not allowed to get a margin like a contract manufacturer would on the drives or why would there be a drag per se?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, you're right, Rich. There is, for a certain period of time, certainty this quarter, a little bit what's included in the last quarter as well and then probably the December, March quarter, as well as we transition the 3.5-inch equipment over to Toshiba, we are building drives for them on a contract manufacturer margin basis and that is dilutive on, as I said, in the quarter. We just ended at about 50 basis points.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: But the units are included in your total unit number or no?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: No.
Stephen D. Milligan: No. Because we don't want to double count them with Toshiba, right? As they ship them through.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And then just lastly, relative to all the noise that was kind of going on in the channel, you said -- or going on the sell side about the channel, you said that your shipments were actually linear to the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in the channel and was there really 30% plus week-on-week inventory changes? Can you just talk about what was really going on in the channel in June.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes, we don't recognize any of those numbers, and in fact, our channel inventories continue to be below 4-week level.
Operator: Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a clarification and a question. Did you say that Toshiba was coming out of the gross margins, the 30% guidance that was excluded?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: That's correct. In a different number of the Toshiba effect is included.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Then my question is when you think about your guidance for $10, you indicated that your share is roughly flat. So I wanted to just hear your reaction to some of the comments Toshiba's made and specifically indicating that it wants to grow its share and is willing to invest both directly and indirectly. How do we reconcile those statements, because I assume that Seagate is going to want to keep its share. How do we reconcile those statements?
John F. Coyne: This is John. Market share is a reflection of the extent of how we delight our customers on a consistent and continuous basis. We earn market share on a daily basis as we execute a strength, long-term strength, of WD and an exhibited strength of HGST in the past several years has been providing the right products in the right way at the right time with the right value proposition to customers. And we believe we can continue to earn that share of business in a competitive marketplace throughout the upcoming year and we're modeling our business on that basis.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Well, I'll ask one last one then I'll certainly yield the floor. In terms of the unit growth -- thanks for that perspective on guidance. Is there any calibration point that you could offer on what you think general pricing trends will be over that same period? And that's it for me.
Stephen D. Milligan: I think that pricing is always one of the more difficult variables to predict in our business. And so we're going to continue to expect it to be, I'll call it, a competitive business. But I think that what -- there's a recognition from our standpoint when we look at pricing that, as John alluded to, there are a number of different factors that are impacting demand. One of the things that is not impacting demand, from our perspective, is the level of disk drive pricing, right? And there's arguably no reason to go and just transfer dollars to not create any elasticity. Right? And so we'll continue to provide the appropriate value to our customers, which includes, yes, you have to make adjustments in your pricing, but we're going to do that in a prudent fashion that ultimately allows for value creation not only from our perspective but also value creation for our customers.
Operator: The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: I have 2 questions. One, can you first review what the shipments were for the industry segments? And I have a follow-on question. Not for WD specifically.
John F. Coyne: You're looking for total industry, yes.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Yes.
Stephen D. Milligan: Wolfgang is digging it out.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I can give you a flavor there, it was a total of 157 million units, as John said. We're about 82 million, 2.5-inch drive; 65 million, 3.5-inch drives; ATA that were about 17 -- they were about 9 million performance enterprise drives and then there were a few 1.8-inch that were shipped.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Okay. So given the performance of the nearline drives and the performance of the client drives, can you talk about what your understanding is of the potential for a cannibalization of, say, a tablet without a hard drive to be transferred into a nearline cloud drive. Is there an application? Is there a one-to-one transfer? Is it a little bit less than that? Can you discuss that?
Stephen D. Milligan: I'm not quite sure I follow your question. Can you kind of clarify that a bit?
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Yes. Essentially, when a client drive is speced with a solid state drive instead of a hard drive. Do you see any sort of data that indicates that, that hard drive that has been displaced with a much lower capacity solid state drive that, that capacity is being transferred into a cloud-based drive given the industry data that you're seeing here.
Stephen D. Milligan: Well, I mean, that's a hard question to answer in a real simple way. I mean, I think what we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it "the hard drive industry," but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increase in data, right? And so, undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we, we being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the, on the HGST side, in terms of the tiering types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing some level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increased participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations, right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business, is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that, right now, both the WD sub and HGST sub have, that's being coupled up in some cases with solid-state, a dual drive configuration, that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get instant on whatever it might happen to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is, is that all of this data growth is a good thing for all of us, and that what we've got to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, the right level of products, interact with our customers in the right way, to continue to bring different solutions that address all these different applications. And so, it's actually, I think we're very optimistic in terms of our ability to be able to do that.
Operator: The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Steve, nice to have you on an earnings call again. I wanted to ask about the MOFCOM details that you talked about last quarter. I think you had hoped to get some concessions from MOFCOM in terms of pieces of the business that you could combine versus pieces of the business you obviously couldn't combine over the next couple of years. Could you give us an update on any progress you've made there.
John F. Coyne: Our conclusion that we will continue to operate the businesses as separate subsidiaries at least through the 2-year initial remedy requirement under MOFCOM and our expectation that we will not achieve measurable synergies in the OpEx environment, that gives you an update on where we are in clarification of the understanding between ourselves and MOFCOM as to how we will operate during the 2-year restriction period.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then now that we're seeing some additional revenue coming from other segments like SSD and you've also mentioned the Toshiba business, which will be in for a couple of quarters, will you be breaking out a non-HDD revenue number? Did you give that this quarter and will you be giving that going forward?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: We haven't decided yet. We're not spelling it out for this quarter beyond what Steve mentioned that it was a 1 million unit in shipments.
Stephen D. Milligan: Hopefully, well, because we want it to be big enough so that we'll have to.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This seems like it's impacting the ASP [ph] a little bit in terms of the calculation. So it will be helpful.
Operator: Next question we have from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I wonder if Steve could refresh our memory in terms of what enterprise shipments were by HGST in the year-ago period.
Stephen D. Milligan: You know, Mark, I honestly don't know. And so I don't have the specific number in front of me. But I can tell you and we've been very fortunate with, and I'm speaking now in the HGST side of being able to meaningfully improve our market position in the enterprise base, both in terms of traditional performance enterprise, as well as capacity enterprise and certainly something that we're very pleased with. And we want to maintain that position. We want to improve that position. We want to continue to deepen our relationships from the customer perspective. And so I apologize for not having that specific number in front of me. But I do know that it has improved rather markedly over the last 12 months.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Your cost of goods sold per drive unit remains high, but some of that's flood effect. And I'm just wondering how much of a upside in terms of continued strong margins, is that going to be significant next year? Are you going to be able to significantly pull those costs down?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: You're right. In the Q4 numbers that we just reported there was for both subs, but in particular for the WD sub, that was mostly impacted by the flood. There was a sort of significant cost disadvantage when compared with pre-flood levels and that has to do with absorption, that has to do with higher external content, that has to do with freight modes that we use and other things, and you should assume that it's a significant opportunity going forward and that we will walk ourselves through that over the next couple of quarters.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Certainly doesn't appear so, but your competitor announced significant component supply issues or problems, it doesn't look like you had any problem. You were able to navigate that issue, is that correct?
John F. Coyne: Yes, we haven't. There's always occasional this, that and the other thing, but nothing significant.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: And the supply components of the channel, is that basically back to pre-flood levels or are there any bottlenecks or anything like that in the channel?
John F. Coyne: I think we're pretty much, both in terms of the mix and quantity of drives, that we're in a position to make available to our customers, matches their needs and the component landscape is appropriate to support both plans.
Operator: Next comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: Actually, I'd like to follow-up with more color. You did mention that there's -- it sounds like about 3 quarters worth of additional cost benefit to work off. I mean, I'm just wondering if you can give us more color in terms of things like, are you still sending things airfreight? At what point do you think you'll be back to that mix of internal versus external heads? How much of the cost increase that we have seen do you think is a more lasting effect versus how much do you think might be worked off, and even a range that you might be able to give us over the next few quarters will be great?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Like I said, I think we'll walk ourselves through everything by the end of the new fiscal year. Some of it is solvable more immediate like the freight mode and some of it like the component mix will take a little bit longer. We said we had multi-quarter agreements there. So it's a gradual improvement throughout the fiscal year.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: And can you give us a sense for how much -- there's been discussion also that some of the cost increases will be permanent because the supply chain will be more diversified? Can you give us a sense for how much we might think about that in terms of the cost?
John F. Coyne: I think we've previously indicated that we expected the impact of that to be $1 to $2 a drive over the long haul in terms of that change in model for the business in terms of change in concentration model and the need to continue to invest in substantial incremental technology right throughout the supply chain as we move forward and address the challenges of delivering areal density on into the future.
Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc: And then can you comment in terms of getting your production back online? Are you completely requalified on everything with all your customers? Has there been any sort of shift? I know one of your suppliers was talking months ago that there's going to be a big shift in areal density in the new equipment that was brought back up and the new process was brought back up. Is there more to go there or is that pretty much behind you as you brought the new capacity back up to the level it's at?
Stephen D. Milligan: That's pretty much all behind us thanks.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to see if we can go back to ASPs. Just to give us a kind of a better understanding of some of the puts and takes. Because I imagine that the blended ASP benefited from a higher mix of enterprise drives this quarter, just given the contribution of growth from a unit perspective from the enterprise. So I wanted to understand that. And then the second part to that question is really about the ASP takedowns that you kind of telegraphed during the last earnings call. Were they kind of inline with your expectations? Were they more severe or less severe, and how should we think about that going into September quarter?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Let me add a few points on that. First of all, to put the LTA that we mentioned, those are all done. There were certain short term agreements. Those are all behind us. The second thing that's important to point out and that we alluded to is that WD as a response to the -- with significant impact to the flood, had increased the prices to the highest level, and we believe in Q1 has clearly met the [indiscernible] on OEM pricing again. Last quarter, pricing actually came in better than expected. You see that with the major impact of our overachieving of the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing. In the flood, the spot markets increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like Steve said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to sub 4 weeks and that includes in transit. But we were able to maintain that spread between the markets a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter. For Q1, implied in our guidance is a mix. Obviously, it includes now our position in the market and enterprise drives. It has our subsidiaries at market pricing for OEMs. And it assumes that the distribution pricing gets into the normal range to the OEM pricing.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes and Mark, this is Steve. Let me add a little bit of a perspective, which I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. But I've been away from the earnings kind of stuff a little bit, but I think it's important that we -- one of the things generally technology prices come down over time, right? And so we are going to have a price declines and it's important. And we have to remind ourselves in terms of how we manage the business to do the same that you not become overly fixated on one particular data point or element of our business. And so we deal with price declines all the time. The question is rate and pace. And then the other thing is that, what we do need to deal with that? How do we manage our cost? How do we manage our mix? How do we introduce new products? How do we find other ways to add values to our customer? And at the end of the day, ultimately, it's our job to figure out how to factor that all in and deliver not only satisfactory products to our customers but a compelling return to our shareholders.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And my other question here is around Apple investments. Wolfgang, has there been any change in terms of the CapEx strategy as you go into fiscal 2013?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, a few points there. First of all, you might have noticed that we came in a bit below what we said in the March quarter. We said 7 -- sorry, what we said in the May call. We said we'll be about 750. We came out at 717. We do also expect that we will not spend the full recovery capital that we indicated of 650 now because obviously, we're not bringing the capacity back to the same level. We earmarked that number at about $400 million as opposed to the $650 million. And for fiscal '13, our capital expenditure number will largely depend on what -- towards the end of the fiscal year, we expect the demand to be for [indiscernible] . But in general, you should assume that our capital spending for the fiscal year will be below the 7% to 8% that we guided to historically.
Operator: Next comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division: Wolfgang, was just wondering you made mention on the call the aerial density ramps in coming quarters. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And, along with that, can you give us an update on when we should expect the ramp of single platter drives and where you are with that now? And anything else on the mix perspective that might service that tailwind to the gross margins going forward.
Stephen D. Milligan: Yes. So let me take that question. So from a technology perspective, there's a few kind of key things that we're really focused on. The first thing is, and you alluded to it, is ramping to more competitive levels or cost competitive levels. The new areal density points whether that's a 500-gigabyte per platter on a 2.5-inch platform and then a terabyte for a 3.5-inch. And so our development teams, our respective development teams, are aggressively working on that ramp and we'll continue to see that transition. I mean, it is already actively in process, but we'll continue to see that occur over the course of this fiscal year. And then the maturity benefits of that from a cost perspective as we improve yields, et cetera. And so that's obviously a key area that we're focused on. The other thing is that, and we've already sort of alluded to this, but we want to continue to make sure that were investing from a product perspective on the opportunities that we see in terms of thin and light applications, whether that be in Ultrabooks or it be in Slimbooks, whatever you want to call them, where we think that we have the ability to continue to package drives in an effective way that allows us to ship into thinner devices. And then additionally, we want to continue the progress that we've made on the enterprise front. And so we're going to continue to invest meaningful dollars in expanding and improving our product portfolio in both subsidiaries so that we can continue to -- and to maintain our momentum, shall we say, in the enterprise area. And then, of course, lastly, is that we'll continue to invest in advanced areal density technologies whether that be shingle write or heat assist or energy assist, whatever you prefer calling. So those are really our priorities from a technology perspective.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess the follow-up is, Wolfgang, I think the word you used or the context you used on buyback that you would you move to be more methodical as opposed to opportunistic? And with the stock word in that, can you give us some sense of how opportunistic you may be willing to be versus methodical or what really we should take away from methodical?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Let me just say this. I mean, we got a significant increase in authorization. We took the opportunity to buy shares last quarter. We will be more systematic rather than opportunistic. We'll talk more to you at our September meeting about the exact details of the capital allocation strategy and I will leave at that for now.
John F. Coyne: And thank you all for your participation in today's call. I'm very pleased with Western Digital's performance in fiscal '12, extending our 10-year record of compound annual revenue and EPS growth, the 19% and 48%, respectively. I'm excited to have such a strong and accomplished leadership team focused on the strategic development of our business to extend this long-term performance into the years ahead. And look forward to sharing our strategy and introducing the leadership to you at our upcoming Investor Day here in Southern California on September 13. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, the timing of our pending divestiture transactions with Toshiba, capital spending and industry conditions and our financial results expectations for the June quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 27, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.  In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call for the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor's information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward looking guidance we provide during this call excludes charges related to the Thailand flooding net of other recoveries, expenses related to the HGST acquisition and any impact from the pending divestiture transaction with Toshiba. Because of the amount of these items, it is not known to us at this time, but we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.  I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer of WD, John Coyne.
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter.  We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business.  Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead.  IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers.  Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD.  When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements.  It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continued to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website.  Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks.  We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies.  With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction.  I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume.  We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results.  As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance.  We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies.  With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thanks, John. A summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package.  We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy.  Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter.  Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68.  OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel.  Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners.  R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas.  Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims.  Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition.  Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter.  Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter.  Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations.  We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million.  HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May.  Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May.  With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that this recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions.  After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals.  WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both factors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels.  While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home.  From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion.  I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter.  With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: John, I wanted to get your take on the status of the inventory deficit in drives. And so Seagate's talked a lot about their perspective on how short the industry is on drives. Yet when the OEMs talk, it seem to have more than enough drives, the ODMs in Taiwan have similar comments. If you could just speak to where is the deficit in drives? And how long do you think, if there is such a deficit, how long do you think it persists?
John F. Coyne: Sure. I think in terms of mobile 2.5-inch drives for the PC industry, I think we're in reasonable balance. The difference from traditional situation is that the inventory instead of being in HDD industry, JIT hubs is in the OEM's own inventory, the PC manufacturers and the ODMs. So as of today, I believe the majority of that business is being done on a direct ship from factory basis so that, that inventory shifted from HDD-owned to customer-owned. And we think that, that business is in reasonable balance relative to supply and demand and traditional inventory levels. The desktop, we think is a little short, and we'll, from an OEM perspective, we'll take through this quarter to approach a balanced situation. Likewise, in -- on the enterprise side, we think performance enterprise is reasonably balanced, capacity enterprise demand continues to exceed supply. And then when we move into the distribution channels, we're looking at inventory levels in the distribution channels that are substantially below those that were the norm pre-flood, about half the level that was typically carried pre-flood and when we look in the retail channels, a similar situation, inventories are still somewhat light. So I think we're going to see...
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Very helpful, John. Just my follow-up then will be is what's your expectations for September quarter, the ability to drive manufacturing, what do you say the unit TAM per output would be from September quarter? And then I'll cede the floor.
John F. Coyne: Well, I think we're looking at a difficult to predict situation in that. This quarter, our estimate of the TAM supposes a 10% quarter-over-quarter growth. If we look seasonally on a traditional basis, we would have expected a flat to down demand relative to last quarter. We think that's a pent-up issue that creates that both back towards normal. We're still, I think, about 4% on a year-over-year, the 160 number for the June quarter would be compared with 166 a year ago. So there's still a little bit of catch up to do to get -- then we expect in the back of the year, we'll see typical quarter-over-quarter progression that tends to be in the 10% range. And that will translate into very substantially year-over-year increases obviously because of the flood impact in October.
Operator: Next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments about being able to meet demand in the quarter. I mean, is that much more of a function of whether it's sourcing from TDK heads or, I guess, Hitachi's in-house ability to meet its own needs versus actually building all those sliders out of Thailand and back to pre-flood production capability in-house?
John F. Coyne: Yes, Rich. The comment relates to our ability to satisfy customers with the drive-level product through both our subsidiaries. And we believe we'll be in a good position this quarter to turn our focus from building raw capacity to turning our focus to matching mix requirements within the overall capacity required by our customers in the current quarter. As I think, both I and Wolfgang noted in our prepared remarks, we still have a significant installed capacity under absorption issue from a cost perspective in the WD sub. And we are currently sourcing above the typical WD external/internal head sourcing rule, our business model that we have set for the long-term. However, as we look forward, we forecast continuing TAM growth each quarter through the balance of the year. And then sustained growth in the industry as we move forward from there. So looked at in a medium to long-term perspective, we're very excited by the opportunities, and we see substantial opportunity for us to continue to improve performance as those cost drags on the business are eliminated by growth as we move forward.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just secondly, regarding your comments about Hitachi signing of a few LTAs at lower prices than March., can you give some quantification of just how far below and what markets might have been involved, and more importantly, your ability to perhaps prevent that type of decision-making in the future within the confines of the Chinese regulators?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think, I mean, you kind of characterized; that, that might not have been a desirable action. I believe it is a highly desirable action to provide assurance of security or supply to customers and to be competitive in addressing market opportunity, thereby, increasing business with certain customers and securing that business into the future. So while the prices are lower in the June quarter than they were in the March quarter based on the total package offered to those customers, business is highly desirable and significantly accretive to the overall well-being of the business. So we're explaining the dynamics of the current market not indicating any kind of problem.
Operator: Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I don't know if you can do this or not, but last quarter you talked about an expectation that your average capacity per drive would be down sequentially in the March quarter. Can you provide us any color on what that look like this quarter as we think about optimizing the mix? And what you are expecting them to be into the June quarter? And then I do have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. The average capacity last quarter was indeed down in all the WD business, lowest single-digit percentage. And we expect that mix to pick up this quarter for the WD sub. The HGST sub mix is a little bit impacted that -- since the June quarter was a quarter where the gaming business picked up and there's a more substantial volume of gaming units and that impacts the mix there.
John F. Coyne: But you could -- you should also assume that as we move through the balance of the year, we will return and both business is likely to operate at market mix.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then my follow-up question is on your guys' slide deck, you guys have a highlighted business model, gross margin, which looks like it's the prior model of 18% to 23%, 9% to 10% OpEx to revenue. I'm curious, is that the model you're out and want to talk to the Street about? Or is that just an old -- reference to the old model because I think guys have given flavor for higher gross margins in particular post the; Hitachi? Any color on how you're thinking about the long-term model and the context of that?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Good observation, Aaron. It's the old model. We haven't officially updated our model. We expect to do so in our September Investor Day. We've given some directional color in the supplemental information that we've provided right when the acquisition closed in -- on March 8, I believe. And from that directional guidance, you can imply that we believe that the gross margin is slightly higher than the June 19 to 24 that we said a year ago. And we also highlighted that the OpEx might be a little bit higher and well, you have to wait for the outcome of the operating plan, operations plan that we're concluding with MOFCOM to specify that. And again, the go-forward model will be communicated at the Investor Day on September 13.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And on that, it looks like you're implying about a 30% to 31% gross margin this current quarter. Is that fair?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: For guidance for the current quarter, that's correct.
Operator: Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: 2 questions if I could. One, I'm just wondering -- I know you didn't in this, but I want to know if you're planning to or not to report or give even any color on the split between WD and HGST units. And then separate from that, if I look at your OpEx guidance of $550 million, it would imply no cost savings from HGST, which I get and I understand, as you guys have communicated, obviously the regulatory constraints. But are there not even any amount of OpEx cut there or savings or synergies you think you're actually be able to get the near-term before 2 years?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. Well, so the -- on your first question, we're not planning in the future to split out the 2 businesses. We're going to split out what the SEC requires. In terms of the $550 million in OpEx, like we said, we've submitted the operations plan to MOFCOM. We're working on certain synergy proposals that are compliant with this plan and what we're going to report what these synergies are when we have finalized the plan with China's MOFCOM.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so that's your most sort of conservative take at this stage or your most realistic, the $550 million?
John F. Coyne: I think it's realistic for the current quarter in that we have to complete our negotiations. Also, I think Wolfgang mentioned, we are continuing to invest in emerging opportunities for hard drives and beyond hard drives. So we're continuing to actually to increase spending in certain areas of the business from an OpEx perspective.
Operator: Scott Craig with Bank of America.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: 2 questions. John, can you first address the TAM of 155 million to 160 million, and circle that around with the comments that you think you'll be able to meet full customer demand? Because I would have thought, given the inventories and the distributor being half the level of normal and a TAM prior to the flood level of hanging around that 170 million mark, that you wouldn't be able to meet customer demand here in the near term. And then secondly, Wolfgang, on the guidance for the June quarter from a revenue perspective, can you provide a little bit more granularity on that with maybe ASPs and units and sort of a mix, where you think that's going to be from a customer segment?
John F. Coyne: Right, so this is John. And my comments on the inventory versus demand, I think we'll be able to meet the true market demand. I don't think we'll do much in the way of rebuilding inventories or recreating the traditional model of where those inventories are and the timing between cutting an order and delivering the product to where it's meant to be. We're using air freight almost exclusively today. The velocity through the distribution channel is very high, and I think as the momentum builds in distribution and the volumes get back to pre-flood levels and as momentum builds back in retail, back to -- towards to pre-flood levels, I think that's the first order of business is to fuel that growth and support it. And then the second order of business, which comes later in the year or possibly early next year, is to see the inventory and distribution models revert to a more normal level of inventory and velocity of that inventory.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: And on your revenue question on the $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion, I mean, I highlighted a few elements regarding to WD's situation now being more recovered from the flood and having pricing reflective of current market conditions. John and I both commented on the multi-quarter agreements that Hitachi has put in place. We also talked about the mix in -- on the HGST side that were reflected by gaming, and all that you need to take into consideration that some volume goes away with the Toshiba divestiture that we are planning for the end of May for this guidance assumption. And overall, like we said before, overall, we're operating below market mix. Like John said, we think that we'll make this up over the next couple of quarters. But those are some of the assumptions that went into the revenue guidance.
Operator: Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division: I guess, along those same lines, but on the gross margin line, can you give us some sense of kind of how long the Hitachi game is run for? Should we think of them through the balance of this year? And now that you guys think that sort of we're going to be moving in market pricing here for the noncontract business, should we think of the June quarter gross margin guidance as being, I guess, sort of the baseline to work from for the balance of the year and then we can use our assumptions around channel pricing and mix for the noncontract portion to sort of guide our models. Any color there will be helpful.
John F. Coyne: I think there's 2 elements. As always, there's 2 fundamental elements to margin. One is ASPs and the other is unit costs. And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external heads to internal heads and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets and our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, being very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, I want to come back to your commentary about you have a series of upside opportunities. It excites the teams. Some of the research we've been doing suggests that the enterprise system OEMs are a little frustrated by one of your major competitors in terms of the pricing environment over the last few months. Are you with either with WD or Hitachi subsidies -- or excuse me, subsidiaries or both of the subsidiaries seen increment opportunities for dual and triple sourcing for these system OEMs?
John F. Coyne: Well, we believe we've got a tremendously strong enterprise portfolio between the 2 subsidiaries. We believe we have a marketplace that is ripe with opportunity, and we're going to pursue it vigorously.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Then a follow-up, just around on CapEx, have there been any instances where Western Digital or Hitachi had to capitalize some of your Tier 1 or Tier 2 suppliers who were hurt by the flood, and how did that play out?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: That was not any big numbers there. We supported some supplies very, very early on with early payments, but it was a very immaterial.
Operator: Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you guys just get a little more granular about ASPs? I mean when you back into the numbers, it would seem that you guys are thinking about a double-digit decrease anywhere like up to 15% sequential decrease in pricing. And I just wanted to kind of you guys to expand upon that? Just -- and then I have a follow-up.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. We didn't imply any percentage increase. We didn't give the volume number. I think we explained what the assumptions are for the ASP that goes into our guidance.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, the other question I had is that prior to the flood, you guys were doing 58 million in volume and Hitachi was doing close to 30 million. What is the run rate number we should assume? And I think you -- people are assuming around 6 million drives for the desktop assets that's being sold. So what is the full capacity of the new company, the run rate kind of full demand in terms of units? And what you're able to do once we get to the September quarter?
John F. Coyne: I mean, I think it's fair to take in terms of capacity to assume that from a invested capital perspective, you're correct in the 58 and 30 facilitization that was in place pre-flood. You're also correct in looking at divestiture to Toshiba. Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilized that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceive to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM. And I think as we look at the longer term for the overall business, we will, in calendar '13 and beyond, be looking at deploying those previously demonstrated skills of adding judicious capacity to meet opportunity in a timely manner.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Well -- then the final thing is just with regard to you generated a ton of free cash flow, $1.1 billion, and if you have a few more quarters like this, you're going to put away a lot of cash. Is there any additional thinking on returning cash to shareholders of the company? And that's it for me.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. Let me first comment on the free cash flow for the last quarter, which was kind of untypical and highly related to the timing of the acquisition. The way be how you should be thinking about free cash flow, and you're right, this company has the potential to create a lot of cash. If you just take this quarter, for instance, at the midpoint of our guidance and 269 million shares, if you apply the gross margin and deduct the OpEx and then take the $350 million CapEx -- or $357 million CapEx, total amortization and depreciation excluding the intangibles that we just added somewhere to $280 million range. If you assume a constant working capital, no investments in working capital, that gives you a free cash flow around $600 million or so. So you're right, that's very substantial. We're actively looking at the cash utilization strategy. And I pointed out that's one of the topics that we're going to cover in September, and we'll update you then.
Operator: Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Now that the industry is able to meet demand, do you have a time frame for when you think your market share normalizes kind of back to the normal levels that would have, if you consider Hitachi and WD combined?
John F. Coyne: The market share is about earning customers' business, and we think we're pretty good at that. We're going to try very, very hard to be good at that and continue to be good at that. And I expect that, that will be reflected in the position at the end of June quarter, which will be the first quarter of execution with both subsidiaries under Western Digital ownership. And I think that will give a baseline starting point from which excellence and execution from a technology deployment, product portfolio, service levels and value, will then drive forward from there.
Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And when you get to that kind of normalized market share level, what does pricing look like? Are we back to the pre-flood levels? Are we reset a little bit higher? Any other comments you can give on the pricing side?
John F. Coyne: No. I think we have indicated previously and I'll reiterate that expectation that the costs incurred by the industry, both to recover the lost capacity relative to the flood and to de-risk the business for our customers in terms of the moving the supply chain around to create a much less concentrated profile, those things have cost attached to them, and I believe that it will be affected through to the customers. So we expect that pricing in the drive industry will continue to be elevated relative to pre-flood levels. We, nevertheless -- that elevation of pricing notwithstanding, we believe that our drives still represent best value in the technology supply chain for the industries we support. And that, that value needs to be reflected in the business model of the hard drive company like ours and to return to our investors for developing and deploying technology at this level.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just have 2 clarifications. Wolfgang, in terms of interest expense for next quarter, I don't think that you said anything. Can you give us some sense of what you expect that to be with the new debt?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Sorry, I didn't catch. Interest expense?
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: That's right around $15 million.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: $15 million, okay. And in terms of the units that your shipped this quarter, can you give us a sense of how many of the units were SAS and fibered channels, so pure enterprise versus near-line products either Western Digital and Hitachi combined or separate or whatever?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. We're usually not breaking out that piece. We've always just give then the enterprise number.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Will you break that out in the future?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: I have no current plans, but we're thinking about it.
Operator: Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to come back to the retail TAM being half what it was a year ago. I assume some of that's availability, but is some of it also cloud storage?
John F. Coyne: No. I don't think it's cloud storage. I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling effect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And a follow-up with Wolfgang on synergies between the 2 subsidiaries, could you talk about that a little bit generically? I assume that some it could include minimizing product overlap, but not really sure what you can and can't do there with the regulator.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. I think we'll address that once we have the operations plan finalized with China's MOFCOM.
Operator: Mark Miller with Noble Capital.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: With a previous comment, there's been a lot of figures thrown around for the percentage of drives that are going to be divested. I think someone mentioned previously, it was 6 million. Can you give us any ballpark figure because we're hearing numbers all over the place.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. I mean...
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Is 6 million being the ballpark of the drives divested?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. If you to -- in the FTC's website, there was actually a pretty good description of the divestiture. And from the number of lines that are being mentioned, you can conclude that it's anywhere in the 5 million to 6 million per quarter capability. And that's probably the best number for you to use that the assets that we're divesting can output in the quarter.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I attribute this more to the greater percentage of long-term agreements, but Seagate kind of stuck its neck out and said that they thought margins would stay above 30% throughout this calendar year. Are you saying pricing will stay up? Can you go any further on that?
John F. Coyne: Well, I can't talk to Seagate's margins, but what I can tell you is we have substantial opportunity on the cost side of our business to enhance our margins, and we will compete in the marketplace to provide value to our customers on a consistent and continuing basis. And now we believe that's what we've done profitably for 10 years, and hopefully, we'll continue to do it profitably for at least another 10 and beyond. So thank you, all for joining us today. As I hope you can tell, we're very excited about the growth opportunities in the data storage industry and about the new WD's ability to participate in this market as a leader in the years ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital Second Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning the impact of the Thailand flooding, including its impact on the industry demand in the next several quarters and the industry's ability to meet that demand, charges and expenses in the March quarter related to the Thailand flooding, flood mitigation measures in Thailand, our insurance coverage, demand for storage in the long-term, a return to pre-flood capacity levels by WD in the industry on our supply chain, our internal slider production in Thailand and Malaysia, industry inventory, diversification of our supply chain and its impact on cost and pricing, our investments and development, the expected completion of the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the timing and outcome of our motion to vacate the award entered against us in our arbitration with Seagate, our capital expenditure plans and our financial results expectations for the March quarter, including unit shipments, revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on October 28, 2011.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. And you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call, excludes charges and expenses related to the Thailand flooding and our planned acquisition of HGST. Because these charges and expenses are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. I would also like to mention that due to daily changes in the industry supply picture and continuing evaluation of our Thailand flood losses and litigation exposures, our financial results for the December quarter are preliminary until we file our Form 10-Q for the quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, we expect additional flood recovery expenses -- related expenses to be incurred in the March quarter, and it is possible that our fixed asset -- impairment estimates for the December quarter may have to be adjusted as the recovered assets are put into production. Also as a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, but we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance.  [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now turn the call over to President and CEO, John Coyne.
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. After my introductory remarks, Tim will provide an update on our operations and Wolfgang will review our Q2 financial performance and current outlook. I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress in our mission to restore our manufacturing capacity in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand. This is reflected in our Q2 financial performance announced earlier today, the continued ramp of our Thai HDD production capacity and in the fact that we have now recommenced slider manufacturing, which had been suspended since October 10.  While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress, thus far, is ahead of our original expectations and is attributable to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. I want to thank all of those involved in this huge and extraordinary effort. We believe industry shipments in the December quarter were about 119 million units, which included approximately 11 million units of pre-flood inventory. Today, one quarter after the floods hit and despite the industry's heroic recovery efforts, supply remains significantly constrained. We believe this condition will persist throughout calendar 2012 with gradual improvement during the year, with industry production in the June quarter approaching pre-flood quarterly build levels.  However, with the expected uptick in demand in the back half of the year, rollover demand from the current shortages and inventories throughout the supply chain at record lows, from component supply through HDD and system manufacturing and distribution and retail channels, we believe the pipeline will not be refilled to normal levels until the first half of calendar 2013.  We believe demand for storage for the long term continues to grow unabated. With the HDD industries remarkable flood recovery effort and the gradual replenishment of the inventory pipeline, we believe rotating magnetic storage will weather its recent challenges and remain the preferred and most cost-effective solution to meet the demand for storage in high volume mass-market applications, with no significant loss of share to competing technologies as we remain focused on innovating and creating compelling value for customers. From a WD standpoint, we expect our own recovery to mirror the trajectory of the industry that I just outlined, with a return to pre-flood capacity levels in the quarter ending September and with our customers' inventory pipeline replenished in the first half of calendar 2013.  This pace of recovery is important as we focus on satisfying our customers' needs and as we respond to their strong encouragement to resume our leading role in the industry.  To that end, our priorities are clear for calendar 2012: First, we will continue to focus on restoring our manufacturing and supply-chain capacity to pre-flood levels; second, in concert with our supply partners, we are establishing the most robust and resilient supply chain of critical HDD components as we ramp our manufacturing capability back up; third, during the flood recovery period, we have maintained our focus and investment in development to ensure that we will be in a position to offer new products with advanced technology to sustain our leadership as we ramp our post-flood production.  We plan to achieve these goals in the same time-tested focus on high-quality, low-cost and crisp execution that has established WD as a trusted leader in the storage industry over the last dozen years. We believe that executing to this strategy and achieving the aforementioned priorities will prove to be a compelling value proposition for our customers as we compete for their future business.  Before turning the call over to Tim Leyden for a review of our operations and recovery effort, I want to comment on 2 additional matters: our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST and the pending litigation with Seagate.  Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST by March of this year is on track, and we continue to work on obtaining the remaining approvals of the transaction from the respective government agencies. We remain very excited about the synergies of the acquisition and the advantages it will create for our customers. On November 18, 2011, an arbitration award of $525 million was rendered against WD. Earlier today, the arbitrator awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $105 million. WD will promptly file a petition to vacate the award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and failed to consider relevant evidence. We anticipate that the court will hear our arguments on our petition in March or April of 2012, and issue a decision sometime thereafter.  While we can provide no assurance that we will be successful, we believe that if the court reviewing our petition correctly considers the law, the arbitration award should be vacated. Tim?
Timothy M. Leyden: Thanks, John. In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as possible.  With this overall objective in mind, we moved quickly to limit the disruption to our customers. We optimized our HDD availability through increased throughput from our Malaysian factory, increased the availability of external HGAs with assistance from SAE/TDK. We engaged our previously idled island employees to recover many of the inundated fixed assets. And once the flooding had receded, we restarted production in our dried-out factories on a limited basis. In addition to these operational initiatives, we took further action to remain profitable and minimize the impact on our working capital. Our team responded magnificently to these challenges, and I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress on the journey back to achieving full pre-flood capacity by the third calendar quarter of 2012. Our focus now is on accelerating our recovery and increasing availability to our customers. At this point in time, we are not constrained relative to HDD assembly or test. We are still constrained by components availability, specifically sliders. We are very pleased with the support we have been getting from SAE/TDK in providing both completed HGAs and processing WD's raw wafers. Additionally, we are grateful for the expeditious recovery efforts of our mechanical and other suppliers, who themselves were affected by the Thailand floods. As of yesterday, we have completed our first batch of post-flood sliders in our Bang Pa-in facility, and we are working through qualification and expect to have a meaningful quantity of internally produced sliders shipping in our HDD products by the end of the current quarter. We are enhancing our infrastructure by extending slider production capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to mitigate risk. We expect to have Malaysian sliders shipping in our HDDs in the June quarter. The Bang Pa-in and Navanakorn Industrial Park landlords and the Thailand government are planning to reinforce and install flood barriers for these industrial zones, and we intend to augment those with company-specific initiatives. We are working with our suppliers to diversify their manufacturing locations in order to reduce geographical concentration. Supplier recovery is progressing well, and we expect that suppliers will be substantially back to pre-flood run rate levels by the June quarter. We are maintaining the pace of product and technology development and though we have encountered challenges due to flooding, we are focused on minimizing the impact. We are currently shipping 1 terabyte per platter of 3.5-inch and 500 gigabytes per platter of 2.5-inch drives in volume.  In accordance with our normal practice, the rate of deployment of those newer technologies is dependent on cost-crossover points at each capacity point. Additionally, I am pleased to report that we have our 900-gigabyte 2.5-inch SAS product in qualification at multiple OEMs. As we emerge from the aftermath of the flooding, we are mindful of coming back with a more robust supply-chain model that seeks to disperse in-house and supplier risks across geographies and factory locations.  This dispersion of volumes across a wider geographical area will contribute to some structural and logistical cost increases, which should be recovered from customers in order to maintain the continuing investment required in one of the high technology and capital intensive business. And one anticipated benefit of our recovery activities is that we are taking advantage of the downtime to improve process efficiencies and cycle times. Supply of HDD is constrained at an overall industry level due to supply-chain disruption. From WD's standpoint, we are allocating product to customers, segments and channels by attempting to maximize HDD availability through optimizing component utilization. We are taking current inventory positions where known into account as we respond to immediate customer needs, while at the same time, paying attention to the fundamentals of running a viable, profitable business, conserving cash and continuing to stay competitive technologically. As a result of balancing all these factors, you will note that, broadly speaking, the percentages of volume supplies to market segments and channels is different to what might be perceived as our more normal supply profile. In general, channels with shorter inventory pipelines are getting higher and more immediate product allocations, while channels with longer inventory pipelines are expected to deplete available inventory before receiving further product allocation.  This methodology was and is being deployed with the intent to maximize the availability of HDD products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon. As a result, we shipped 9.8 million netbook drives --notebook drives, 11.4 million desktops, 2.4 million CE, 3.2 million branded and 1.7 million enterprise units into the marketplace during the December quarter. I will now comment on expected industry supply-demand conditions for the current quarter and the balance of calendar 2012. We expect demand to again significantly exceed supply during the March quarter and to add to the net supply deficit that occurred during the December quarter. We estimate that supply in the March quarter will be back-end loaded, as components' availability improve, and that there will be further depletion of inventory in each of the segments and channels, leading to better clarity around supply-demand positions as the quarter unfolds. WD's HDD production will continue to be constrained by component availability. In contrast to the December quarter, where inventory buffers in all sectors of the supply chain, somewhat mitigated the HDD shortage as evidenced by the PC OEM units being only modestly down from expected volumes. Most of that excess inventory has now been extracted, and inventory levels are extremely low.  These depleted inventory levels, coupled with any rolled over demand as a result of the December and March quarters supply deficits mentioned above, the additional prospects of the increasing seasonal demand in the back half of the year and the value proposition from the emerging ultrabook and Windows 8 introductions will mean that the HDD supply will struggle to match demand through calendar year 2012. Consequently, we do not expect meaningful inventory replenishment until the first half of 2013.  In WD's case, we are targeting throughput to approach 60%, 80% and 100% of pre-flood production volumes in the March, June and September quarters, respectively. I'll now turn the call over to Wolfgang for commentary on fiscal Q2 and our forecast for fiscal Q3 2012.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance the last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the March quarter. For the December quarter, revenue was $2 billion, down 19% from the prior year and 26% from the September quarter. We shipped a total of 28.5 million hard drives as compared to 52.2 million and 57.8 million for the year ago and the September quarters, respectively. In excess of 3 million units that we shipped to customers during the December quarter were manufactured in the prior quarter. Average selling price was approximately $69 per unit, up $22 from the year ago quarter and up $23 from the September quarter. There were 2 customers, which each comprised 10% or more of our total revenue: Acer and Dell.  OEM sales represented 59% of revenue, up from 45% in the prior year and 53% in the September quarter. Distribution channel sales represented 25% of revenue, down from 33% in the prior year and 29% in the September quarter. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 16%, down from prior year's 22% and September's 18%.  Revenue from sales of our branded products was $328 million, down 40% from the year ago quarter and 33% from the September quarter. As Tim mentioned earlier, we deliberately allocated production output by balancing immediate customer needs with prevailing inventory positions. Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, up from 19.2% in the year ago quarter and 20.1% in the September quarter. The increase in gross margin is a result of higher ASPs, partially offset by higher cost per unit. On average, per unit costs were approximately $10 higher than in the September quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and a higher cost for other components as a result of the flood impact on ourselves and our supply-chain partners. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $287 million in the December quarter as compared to $235 million and $282 million in the year ago and September quarters, respectively.  SG&A included $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the December quarter and a total of $18 million in acquisition and unrelated litigation accruals in the September quarter.  Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $276 million, $235 million and $264 million in the December, year ago and September quarters, respectively. The increase in total R&D and SG&A is due to higher spending on development and marketing of new products, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas and higher incentive accruals. Expenses for the December quarter also included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand floods. These costs consist of $109 million of fixed asset impairments and $90 million for damaged inventory, recovery and remediation services and wage continuation. This does not include any offset of potential insurance recoveries. The company, as we have previously stated, carries property and business interruption insurance. Discussions with our insurance carriers are moving forward, but the claim process is still in its early stages. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $2 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Net expense for the December quarter was $15 million or 9.4% of pretax income.  Our net income for the December quarter totaled $145 million or $0.61 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share for the year ago quarter and $239 million or $1.01 per share in the September quarter.  The December quarter included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood and $14 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees. Whereas the September quarter included the combined $21 million for acquisition-related expenses, bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals.  Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the December quarter totaled $358 million or $1.51 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter and $260 million or $1.10 per share in the September quarter. As John indicated in his remarks regarding the arbitration award, we intend to promptly file a petition to vacate. We believe that if the court correctly considers the law, the award should be vacated. As a result, we have not made an accrual for the award in the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the December quarter was a positive 5 days. This consisted of 34 days of receivables, 31 days of inventory or 12 turns and 60 days of payables. Once we realized the extent to which our production was impacted, as well as the impact to our key suppliers, we shortened payment terms with our customers and directed more cash to our strategic component and equipment supply partners in order to stabilize the supply chain and support a quick recovery. I would note that we did not accept prepayments from our customers, and prepayments to suppliers were not material.  We generated $378 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $258 million.  Capital spending for the December quarter totaled $120 million. December quarter disbursements were for assets that were ordered prior to the flood.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the December quarter totaled $140 million.  Recovery capital received during the December quarter was not significant as the lead time for such items is several months. March quarter capital spending will include a significant amount of replacement capital. The total amount of capital spending we will incur during calendar of 2012 to restore our capacity to pre-flood levels and increase the robustness of our supply chain is approximately $650 million. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be between $750 million and $800 million inclusive of recovery capital. This was accomplished by reallocating much of our original capacity capital to recovery capital. Capital spending for technology-related assets continues as originally planned. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the December quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $231 million.  We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, an increase of $249 million from the September quarter. Approximately $3.2 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the March quarter. Despite the heroic efforts of our employees and suppliers resulting in the recommencement of operations in both drive and slider factories, our March quarter output will be significantly constrained and we expect to ship between 31 million and 33 million drives. Total demand for the quarter is expected to significantly exceed industry supply capability. We expect that our pricing will continue to be significantly above pre-flood levels due to the supply-constrained environment, under-absorption of our manufacturing assets and higher component costs. Average costs will not improve significantly quarter-over-quarter. While we have greater output and therefore less impact from fixed cost absorption, we do not have the benefit of mixing in pre-flood lower-cost inventory.  With respect to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in growth areas, such as our Enterprise, SSD and Branded Products businesses.  Our March guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses or charges and expenses related to the flood. In relation to expenses related to our flood recovery efforts, we expect to incur about $50 million, consisting primarily of ongoing reclaim and recovery work and wage continuation for idled workers. With these sectors in mind, our March quarter guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion; R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $275 million, excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our 6% to 9% business model; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 239 million; accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, maybe just a little bit of clarification on the expectations for getting back to 100% of your potential capacity to pre-flood levels. Around when in the June quarter do you think that happens? And what are your assumptions around sort of some of the supply chain and the ability of the supply chain to ramp up to where you need it to for that quarter?
John F. Coyne: Okay, Scott, actually we indicated that we would be back to pre-flood capacity in the September quarter. And we believe that the suppliers and the supply chain will be back to pre-flood capacity during the June quarter.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, so then the 100% that you're talking about for the September quarter, you expect to hit 100% sometime in the September quarter? Or wouldn't you have to hit that in the June quarter to be able to hit 100% in the September quarter?
John F. Coyne: Yes. I mean it's splitting hairs really, but we will be -- we think -- we expect to be at 100% of capacity in the September quarter. So yes, exiting the June quarter, we'll have to be getting to that run rate.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just one other follow-up. On the ASP side of things for the quarter, Wolfgang, you guys just reported, can you maybe talk about like-for-like pricing versus the mix and sort of what the influences on both of those were?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. A couple of things to consider. First of all, the pre-flood ASPs for the units that we shipped was obviously lower than what we shipped from week 4 to week 13. There was some moderate mix down, probably 8% to 10% in the ASP. And if you take that into consideration, the ASP included in our guidance is down from the Q2 level. If you use the numbers we've provided, it's somewhere in the $64 to $65 area, and that's the result of us aligning pricing between channels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I want to go back to the recovery discussion. You guys earlier in the call had made a comment about 60% return to pre-flood levels of production. Just math would assume that, that's closer to about 40 million drives versus your guidance of 31 million to 33 million, which would be about 50% recovery. I'm just trying to understand what the difference is between those?
Timothy M. Leyden: Actually 60% of pre-flood recovery comes out at around 35 million units.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, so you guys shipped about 58 million units pre-flood. You are running above your capacity level for normalized production capacity at that point?
Timothy M. Leyden: That's the pre-flood capacity that we were referring to is 58 million units, and 60% of 58 million units is 34.8 million.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then just an update -- I know you're not talking about post-acquisition dynamics, but can you remind us what kind of balance sheet -- what kind of cash position you expect to have post the Hitachi deal as it stands today?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I can't do that. Like we said, we have an ending cash balance of about $3.9 billion. We have arranged a term loan of $2.5 billion and an additional revolver available to us of $500 million. We will take out the current debt we have on the balance sheet, the $231 million. And then the cash that we'll transfer to Hitachi is just short of $3.5 billion. So with that in mind, we'll have a very solid cash balance after we consume the acquisition.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So to be clear, you'll be net positive or net cash position post-deal?
John F. Coyne: That's a good assumption.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You talked about a gradual improvement in supply-demand over the next 3 quarters. Does the drop in pricing trend on a linear basis with that supply improvement? Or are there other dynamics as it relates to either volatility in channel pricing or long-term supply agreements that suggests that pricing will look different than the supply improvements?
John F. Coyne: I think the fundamental difference in a post-flood recovered era versus pre-flood is that we will have created a more robust and more geographically dispersed supply chain, which will have some intrinsic cost increases relative to pre-flood footprint. Additionally, in getting back the capacity wiped out by the floods, there's been significant incremental spending by ourselves and by our supply chain and by the industry supply chain in general. And so we expect that, that incremental investment will be reflected in the costs that are carried forward into the future. So we think that while there will be a gradual reduction of the pricing that's being driven by the imbalance between supply and demand in a stabilized situation where inventories have been rebuilt throughout the chain to normal levels, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2013 calendar year. That when prices stabilize in that environment, we expect they will be at a higher level than pre-flood due to the incremental costs that I just outlined.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And is it a moderate difference? A 5% to 10% price difference versus pre-flood or could it be more than that?
John F. Coyne: No, I think it's a moderate difference.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just quickly to change the topic, away from Thailand. Just curious what your view is on ultrabooks. Do you agree with Intel's view that 40% of consumer notebooks in a year or so could be ultrabooks? And what type of storage medium would you expect that form factor to have?
John F. Coyne: I expect ultrabooks to have both hard drives, traditional hard drives and hybrid hard drives and SSDs. So I think there will be, depending on the specific version of ultrabook, you will see all 3 solutions and even in certain models, choices between those solutions in the same model. And we think that the SSD penetration profile will be in very low single digits in a mature ultrabook environment. And then we see an emerging position for hybrids a little early to develop a view on exactly what percentage of penetration, but we see hybrids as a very compelling alternative on the performance side to solid state on bang for the buck. And we anticipate that in large capacity environments, traditional hard drives will continue to be the compelling solution.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Technology Insights Research.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Could you talk about the logic behind the implied ASP plans being down only 6% Q-on-Q? In terms of what you expect the channel to OEM mix to be, it looks like the channel pricing is already exhibiting some pricing elasticity as supply comes back online here.
John F. Coyne: Yes. I mean I just can repeat what we said earlier. We had a $69 ASP in the December quarter, which included pre-flood pricing that was significantly lower than that. So you can expect that our post-flood pricing was in the 70s, and we'll be guiding to a revenue guidance that includes somewhere in the $64 to $65 range, and that includes some adjustments between the channels.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC: Okay. And then also can you give any guidance on what you expect the disc-to-drive ratio trajectory to be as you get to this full gigabyte recovery into 1H '13? When does that disc-to-drive ratio bottom? Is it in the March quarter? Or will it be in the June quarter?
Timothy M. Leyden: We actually had experienced a reduction during the course of the December quarter. We expect that it will be a further slight reduction in the March quarter and then, it will start to improve in the June quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Considering the shortages this year of HDDs and the need to refill inventory in the channel, in terms of your capacity planning, are you planning on increasing your manufacturing capacity beyond what it was in 2011?
Timothy M. Leyden: As we have indicated, our targets that we have stated of 60%, 80% and 100% in the March, June and September quarters, that is a throughput number. And that's the indication of the capacity that we are planning in that period of time.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I guess to me that suggests that you're not planning on increasing capacity above what it was at pre-flood levels.
John F. Coyne: I think we want to take a look at, as the market builds back and gets close to a balance between supply and demand, we will be able to get a closer look at true demand, true end-market demand unconstrained by supply. And then as we have done for years, we'll make appropriate decisions on capacity expansion based on the market demand as we perceive it at that time, recognize that we can typically offer a stable base. We can add capacity at a pretty rapid lick should we judge that the market requires it.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the pricing to the OEMs, I know some of your competitors have talked about long-term agreements that they put in place with the OEMs, have you talked to the OEMs and put in place any long-term pricing agreements?
John F. Coyne: We've been extremely encouraged by the level of support from our OEMs, and indeed from our broader customer base. But in particular, our major OEMs have been extremely supportive of WD through these challenges, continue to press us to return to pre-flood capabilities as soon as possible. The award of business, the award of share is something that you execute every day in order to earn from your customers. We have consistently done that over the last 12 years. We will work to store our capacity and continue to work at delighting our customers and presenting them with an exceptional value they can get nowhere else in the industry. And I can't say enough to thank our customers for their support and encouragement as we build back our capability.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 questions for me. Can you talk about the average capacity drive shipped in the quarter versus the September quarter and what you think you might be able to do in March?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I think I mentioned earlier, Rich, we mixed down about 8% to 10% from September to December. And what Tim just indicated, there might be a slight mix down in the March quarter before we see the capacity of the drive going up again.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the cash award or the judgment award that you're fighting against Seagate, should it go awry and you have to actually pay that, would that have to come out of U.S. cash? Or would you be able to use your offshore cash since Seagate is an Irish company?
John F. Coyne: Well another little piece of information, I mentioned as I referred to our petition to vacate that arbitration award, I said we would file it promptly. I can confirm that we have filed the petition since the start of this call. And we believe that the -- when that goes to court, as the court reviews that and considers the law, that the arbitration award will be vacated on that basis. We have made no accrual for that award in the current accounts. So that -- I guess you have -- paying is in our belief does not arise. We can't assure you of success, but that's our position today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Just like to get your feeling about the general, we've talked about pricing, but do you see distribution pricing falling since that went up significantly more that what I understand was the OEM price increases? Do you see that falling more quickly than the OEM pricing? Or will they fall relatively in a linear fashion?
Timothy M. Leyden: Well as we've indicated, the number -- the pricing number that we had in December was, it came out at $68, $69. And we have forecast, that it would come down slightly during the course of the current quarter, and that's more of an alignment by channel. And so we have taken that into account. And as John indicated earlier on, we are -- it's more a question of aligning supply with demand and also of satisfying the needs of our customers. So consequently, there will be a cost increase, as John also indicated, and that cost will be reflected in the pricing once things settle down. But at the moment, there's a pretty significant deficit between supply and demand, and we're taking that into account as best we can, make the assumptions at this point in time, and that's we're reflecting.
Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I believed that you indicated that during the quarter, there were more heads, and that was one of the reasons that cost went up on externally. Was that driven by the shipping of these higher capacity products, areal density products?
John F. Coyne: No. The -- one of the things that we've indicated for many years in maintaining our strategy of sourcing heads internally and a significant proportion externally was the management of risk. And as we saw in the floods where we were dependent for slider fab of internal to a very significant extent in that one facility at Bang Pa-in, our long-standing relationship and strategic decision to have a significant external source now stands us in very good stead. As we ramp that external source to support us while we bridge to bring back up capacity in our own facilities so that we can ramp demand back up to full production. So the -- basically, we've indicated that we allocated those available heads both internal and external to a mix of product, which was about 8% to 10% mix down in the December quarter versus September quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JPMC.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A question, if I could. Sorry if it's been asked already. In terms of the March outlook, I heard your estimates in terms of the WD units, but can you talked about what the industry shipments could be now that the pre-flood inventory buffer is no longer present?
John F. Coyne: We don't really know yet. Seagate gave some indication of their expectations for March capacity. We've just given an indication. We don't yet understand what Hitachi and Toshiba may be capable of, given their progress with supply-chain rebuild, et cetera. So what we do know is that there's going to be a significant shortage between the supply capability of the industry and its supply base and the demand pattern in the quarter, which comes on top of now a defined shortfall last quarter if we accept that the true TAM, the true demand was in the 175 million to 180 million range, and we know the industry shipped 119 million. So there's 50 million units shortfall there and another 11 million that was squeezed out of the overall supply chain by our estimation. We think there'll be some -- some of the small amount of remaining inventory will be squeezed out of the March supply line, as well as whatever the industry manages to ship in. But in any event, there's going to be a significant shortage gap between those 2 numbers.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Do you think that gap kind of stays the same? Or does it get actually worse now this quarter...
John F. Coyne: I don't think it gets worse.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then my other question, John or Tim or Wolfgang, whoever wants to take it, as you guys contemplate this return back to 100% to pre-flood levels sometime during the summertime, can you give us a sense in terms of how much of your internal sourcing composition will change in terms of what was external versus internally sourced prior to the flood versus how it will look after you're back to 100% post-flood?
John F. Coyne: I think we've consistently targeted that percentage to be about 20% with a range around that. But depending on circumstances, it goes plus, minus 5% to 10%, right? So the -- and that model is going to continue into the long-term future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Gentlemen, you mentioned that you're still confident that the merger with HGST will close by March. Would you mind just kind of discussing a little more about you -- why you have that confidence still? There's just been questions around China MOFCOM support, as well as how the sale is going from the EU conditions. So any details around that will be helpful.
John F. Coyne: Well we have several full approvals, we have several conditional approvals, conditional approvals from EU, Japan and Korea, and we continue to work with the FTC in the U.S. and with China to gain approval there. And we believe that we will be in a position to meet the conditions of the approvals granted by the authorities that have granted conditional approvals so far. And we believe that we will achieve approvals from the -- to China and the U.S. before March.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And my follow-up is with regard to slider production. I'm sorry if you said this, but have you -- are you ramping efforts outside of Thailand as a contingency? And is there any time line on that? Or do you think you're going to stay in Thailand with the slider production predominantly? I'm sorry if you answered that and said it.
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes, in my prepared remarks, I addressed that. I indicated that we are extending capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to spread that risk.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Are you doing that already or you didn't say?
Timothy M. Leyden: Sorry I didn't get...
John F. Coyne: In heads produced from the new Malaysia slider fab will be in drives in the June quarter.
Operator: Next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up on long-term agreements. Do you have a sense how the LTAs that Seagate has signed will impact your business, if at all, this year, calendar '12?
John F. Coyne: We don't have insight into the terms of any Seagate LTAs. We believe that customer share is earned day by day with execution on value. We're focused on that, working with our customers to rapidly recover our position as soon as we can. The current conversations with our customers indicate that they are very desirous of that situation. And our problem is not agreements, our problem is internal execution to be able to satisfy our customer needs, and we're focused on improving our execution and building our capacity to supply our customers.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Would you want LTAs to be status quo for the industry post Thailand issue?
John F. Coyne: Well I mean we've had LTAs with multiple customers for many, many years. They generally provide an outline under -- of the terms and conditions, under which we will work with our customers. And indeed, we have LTAs with certain suppliers. And they provide a framework within which we execute. And the extent to which we execute effectively typically influences the overall level and profitability of the business we do.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Last question for me. You talked about capacity coming on back online as the year unfolds. Could you talk about certain drive types? It's our understanding that there's more constraints in the near-line enterprise market specifically.
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes, the near-line market was down quite a bit in the last quarter, significantly constrained, we would say supply-wise because there was some bleeding of inventory as well. It went down from 6.8 million to 5.3 million, I believe. So that continues to be short. There is a lot of demand, cloud-related demand in that market. And we continue to service as much of it as we can, and we'll continue to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC: Just following up on that. Could you maybe provide a little bit more color around how close should be the matching the mix demand when you get out to 100% capacity? You talked in total units, but I was curious if -- when you actually think your mix will be back to levels pre-flood?
Timothy M. Leyden: As we get back to full production capacity, we expect to be able to match the mix exiting the June quarter.
Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC: And then just lastly on the gross margins. Given some of the direction you've given around pricing and mix as well, where would you anticipate gross margins trending over next few quarters relative to your long-term targets? And what would we be looking for, say, a year from now?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: In the next quarter, if you do take the numbers that we've provided, you can impute that, and you'll see that somewhere in the 29% to 30% range. A little bit early to talk beyond that time frame as we recover, and we're not changing our long-term business model right now. We're going to wait until we close the acquisition and until we're back to pre-flood capacity, and I will give you an update on that one.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cindy Shell [ph] with Lazerne [ph].
Unknown Analyst: A couple of questions. One, there's been some talk from -- I know your supplier requires about -- the capacity that's being restored going up straight to the next basically areal density, and I was wondering is that -- as you restore capacity, the plan and what are the risks you see around that?
John F. Coyne: Well I think, Cindy, Tim already indicated that the way we had traditionally managed our business and the way we'll continue to manage the business is that we manage transitions on areal density based on the needs of each specific market capacity point and the cost profile, cost crossover profiles between old and new ways of satisfying that capacity point. It's an area that WD has historically excelled at relative to results in the rest of the market, and we will continue to manage our business that way.
Unknown Analyst: And then there have been some comments about margins within my industry contacts, really, saying they think that the margins, gross margins, really resettle at a much higher level than we've seen over the past few years. It sounds from your last -- the answer to the last question that you're not knowing to drive a stake in the ground, but if you are, I'd be curious as to your thoughts on that?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes. Like in the previous answer, we're not going to provide any forecast beyond the March quarter.
John F. Coyne: Well thank you, all, for joining us today and for your continued interest in WD. I want to again acknowledge the heroic effort by our employees and our supply partners in helping us achieve the progress we have thus far and to assure our customers and shareholders that we're working hard to return the company to its leadership position. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. To begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry demand in the December quarter and the industry's ability to meet that demand. The impact for the flooding in Thailand on the industry and on our business on the December quarter and beyond, including our HDD capacity, our planned operations, recovery efforts and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with these efforts, and our ability to complete these recovery efforts. The expected completion and the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth opportunities in the industry, our product offerings in the near-line enterprise market, OEM inventory levels and our financial results expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate share count and loss per share.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 12, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. And you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between historical GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in the Investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at westerndigital.com.  The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with and following the planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, and unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand. Because these acquisition-related and unusual expense items are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. We ask that analysts limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question.  I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. As you can imagine, the WD team has been consumed recently in dealing with the relentless flooding in Thailand and its significant impact on our employees, their families and our suppliers, as well as on the business infrastructure in the region. We are grateful that the WD employees in Thailand are safe at this time, although many of their lives and homes have been disrupted and damaged. This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times.  Having addressed the safety of our people and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi-quarter challenge. We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels.  Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers. In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we're dealing with a operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook.  Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just above the high-end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is a record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industry, demonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universe, even in an environment of broad-based, low growth and global economic uncertainty.  While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was nevertheless muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which has time shifted typical seasonal linearity.  WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe the acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore, we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year.  Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost-effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high-quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market.  While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I'm highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team with its strong execution skills to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiency. This is a short-term challenge in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD.  Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I want to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company leader could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team. Tim?
Timothy M. Leyden: Thank you, John. Firstly, I would cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the Thailand flooding on our business.  WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago period. As we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses, where our value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix, pass through to customers of a portion of our rare earth material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year.  Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1%. Price declines for the quarter were at a minimal level and were less than the seasonal norm. Product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million, as we invested funds and working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter.  Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, industry shipments increased to $119 million from $118 million in the June quarter and were up from $115 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger, although this seasonal uplift was more muted than we have seen historically than is typical of fiscal Q1.  The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 million to 6.8 million units and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market continues to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market at 7.9 million units was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter.  We remain on plan to bring our third-generation, 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year. HDD manufacturer shipments in the Branded Product segment came in at 14.4 million units, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter as a sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was a strong at 24.1%. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters.  WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million units in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflects strong customer preference for WD's appealing product lineup. The remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. Now turning to the December quarter. We believe that the unconstrained HDD demand TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply-constrained due to the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers and factories in various industrial states in the flooded and flood-threatened areas.  I'll now address the specific impact of the flooding on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities from the beginning of last week in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe. And we moved much of the equipment, which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors.  Despite the heroic efforts of our team, over the past weekend, rising water, which had first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park's flood defenses were breached on Monday morning, local time, and water began to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night.  The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly test and slider facilities, where a substantial majority of our slider fabrication capacity resides. In parallel with the intermittent slider shortages resulting from the above disruption, we're also experiencing other shortages on component paths from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods or have been affected by protective plant shut downs.  We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis. But in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need the water level to stabilize, after which point, it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We're assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and either extract and transfer the equipment to clean rooms in another locations or prepare it for operation on-site.  As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers' capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters. We are working with our suppliers to affect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations. We are proceeding with all possible haste and ingenuity to address the situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facility's throughput.  I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter.  For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12% from the prior year ended June quarter. [indiscernible] average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter and up $2 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded products revenue was up 28% from the June quarter. There were no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue.  Demand in Asia remains strong at 59% of revenue, up from 54% in the prior year and down slightly from 60% in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22% of revenue, down slightly from 23% in the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. America with 19% of revenue, was down from both last year's 23% and June's 20%.  OEM sales represented 53% of revenue, up from 50% in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June's 55%. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18%, flat to the prior year but seasonally up from June's 16%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1%, up from 18.2% in the year-ago quarter and 19.5% in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segment and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly as higher costs of rare earth materials were not fully offset by savings in other areas.  As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments before passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarter.  While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the mid-point of our target business model. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million from the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively.  The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included the combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million or 9.8% of revenue in the September quarter versus $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development.  Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million for commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million. Net expense for the September quarter was $19 million or 7.4% of pretax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Komag, the magnetic media company we acquired in September of 2007.  Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million or $1.01 per share, as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share for the year-ago quarter and $158 million or $0.67 per share in the June quarter. September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million or $1.10 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter and $193 million or $0.81 per share in the June quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 72 days of payables. We generated a $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increase as we're experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million.  Capital expenditure for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $263 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately, $3 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore.  Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter. From a market perspective, we believe that starting inventory in the distribution retail channels was very lean and we believe there were no further increases of the inventory levels that our OEM customers hold. We estimate that approximately 40% of all drives in the industry are produced in Thailand, with Western Digital being overweight [ph] at approximately 60%.  With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter. We've shut down our Thailand factories and are at this point, not in a position to establish when they will recommence operations. Furthermore, some of our key suppliers have ceased production as well and are significantly impacted. We are working diligently with them but at this point in time, we do not yet fully understand the timeline for their full recovery. Both of these conditions will likely continue into the March quarter and possibly beyond. Costs will be impacted negatively by the significant under-absorption of our assets and infrastructure. We also expect to incur additional costs in restoring supply. We will also forego land-ocean savings in favor of airfreight in order to increase immediate availability for our customers.  On the OpEx aside, we will continue to invest in growth areas such as our enterprise, SSD and branded product businesses. We will continue to see acquisition-related expenditures during the quarter. We expect to incur unusual charges and expenses related to the impact of the flooding on our operations, including items such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges related to cancellation of purchase order for excess materials, further charges for reclaim and recovery work and foreign currency losses to settle forward exchange contracts that exceed our current requirements.  With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows: This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just referred to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation. And as we have said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve.  We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 million and 26 million units. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges. We expect tax expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $234 million. Accordingly, we estimate a non-GAAP loss per share of between $1.10 and $1.50 for the December quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand.  Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: In terms of understanding what's going on in Thailand, do you have any sense of the impact to the total supply chain? And by asking that, I mean, what do you expect the industry's ability to shift products to be in the December quarter?
Timothy M. Leyden: Sherri, this is Tim. As we pointed out in the scripts, it is a very live situation. We are looking at mechanical components of the ones that seem to be the most impacted at this stage when we look at the external components. In our own case, we're impacted internally through the slider fab because the vast majority of our product, of our internal sliders are made in Bang Pa-in at the ground floor, which is now inundated with water. We also process small percentage of WD wafers through a slider fab in the Philippines, which we will be ramping up. And in addition, you'll recall that our long-term model for our finished heads is to purchase 10% to 20% from the merchant market. So what we see is, in our case, the slider fab is the limiting situation. And we see mechanical components and motors significantly impacted. But we are not in a position to be able to provide insight into how that impacts the rest of the industry and it would be merely speculative on our part at this stage.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then just thinking about your facility in Malaysia, how much extra capacity do you have in Malaysia that you could utilize? And do you have plans to buy equipment to go into Malaysia or to move equipment there?
Timothy M. Leyden: We're looking at every possible option in order to improve our capacity. But right now, we're more constrained by material and component availability. But there is plans underway to be able to react and to increase our production in the Malaysian factory and indeed, to extract the equipment from the buildings that are currently inundated and put them in other clean room locations. All of that is -- the planning for that is underway. But as you can imagine, with the infrastructure and the logistical problems that are there, it is not an easy task because the water is still surrounding our facilities. So we'll have to figure out a way to extract the water and/or figure out a way that we can use the water in order to extract equipment. And as well as that we are looking at new -- at purchasing equipment, et cetera in order to make sure that we can react to our customer needs because this is a significant issue for all the constituents involved, the customers, employees, ourselves, the community and shareholders, we understand the seriousness of this.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham and Co.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I know it's a dynamic situation but in terms of the equipment itself, what happens when water touches it? I mean, is it even recoverable? And are all those suppliers still in existence or what actually has to happen from an equipment standpoint if they're not. And then I have a quick follow-up.
John F. Coyne: Well, there are people that were able to engage in order to provide an evaluation of similar situations, which we are pursuing. And we did remove, in many cases, we removed the electronics from the heavier equipment and got it up to higher ground. But there's a -- it really is going to depend on an assessment once we get in, have a look and see what sort of impact from the water. And perhaps any other -- monitor whatever else is in there. And we're looking at obviously the equipment manufacturers and the people who would be able to provide equipment. We're looking in the used market and so we're looking at every possible option.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, from an insurance standpoint, can you talk about to what degree you are insured against these losses? Is there just equipment inventory or is it also some level of business continuity insurance? Was it insured despite being related to hit around flood plains and such?
John F. Coyne: Yes, we carry flood insurance for both our equipment and inventory and we also have business interruption insurance.
Operator: Scott Craig [ph] with BMI-Mellon [ph].
Unknown Analyst - : Tim, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when you talk about multi-quarters and you kind of looked at what, say ON [ph] Semiconductors said this morning, it sort of looks like this going to take a year for yourselves and the industry to recover. Is that sort of the right timeframe even if you are capable of setting up shop elsewhere or transferring equipment and stuff like that? And then secondly, around the Malaysia facilities, can you provide a little bit more details as to what sort of capacity utilization that facility was running at and how quickly you can transfer stuff over to that facility recognizing that there is some components constraint issues as well?
Timothy M. Leyden: Yes, I can't speculate on the length of the period. I mean, the WD team has effectively in times past been able to take facilities from just a shell and bring it up and get it up to high volume in a relatively short period of time, certainly within -- well within the period that you mention. Then as far as the Malaysia is concerned, it is, as you can well imagine also, there does has to be some reconfiguration. We have to make sure that we can run all the different array of products in there, so there has to be some reconfiguration. But again, that is something we have done before, something that the team is very skilled at and we've got a very dedicated team. And they're looking at every possible option in order to get the plant up and running. But as I say, right know, our biggest constraint is components.
Operator: Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can we talk about inventory a little bit, John? I'm a little confused. I guess, there's OEM inventory. There's distributor inventory and then there's your inventory, which you have finished goods that you said was a lot of rare earths. Can you just kind of talk about what kind of buffer, if there is any, in the industries out there from a distributor and OEM level? How many weeks can the industry and yourselves operate and based on what you see out there. And then I have a follow-up.
John F. Coyne: Sure. We think the distribution inventory exiting last quarter was in the 4-week range. We believe that the OEM jet hub inventories will be at about the 2-week range. And then our own inventories, the majority of which was on boats at quarter end, I think probably about 1 week. Our competitors, as you know, tend to run a little heavier on inventory than we do. So from an -- I would think that the distribution comment, industry level and WD levels, are equivalent. I think in the OEM jet situation, you're probably around that same number with a larger number of weeks in enterprise inventory. And then I think internal company inventories you could readily see from a review of their financials.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, can you talk about the cash impact you're looking at? I assume I don't think, Wolfgang, you mentioned the CapEx, and it maybe hard to say. But it looks like you got to spend money on equipment on this. And we're just wondering is the cash flow impact more than the loss? And to what degree? And then the follow-up to that is then you have insurance, so I assume there's some cash recovery. So, I guess, your best guess on cash, the puts and takes, and what we should deduct.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I can give you some guidance there. Obviously, you start at the last levels that were specified. Depreciation runs at about $160 million that you add back. For the capital that we've already received and that we are obligated to pay and that we'll pay, you can assume roughly $150 million. That does not include replacement capital. As Tim said, it's simply impossible for us to estimate that at the current point in time. As you know, we have about $31 million of scheduled debt repayments every quarter. And we do expect some impact on the working capital, in particular, as we support some of the suppliers that are hit very, very hard by this. If you assume $100 million impact just as a working assumption, you would see that our cash impact, based on the guidance we have given, is anywhere between $375 million and $475 million. And again, that excludes the one-time expenditures that we will incur for incremental services, replacement equipment, et cetera.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, a hypothetical for you. If WD had all of your facilities, let's say, in Singapore and Malaysia, what would be the relative decline sequentially in units due to components because of the Thailand flooding. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the ramifications are for not just WD but for the broader industry. Would you still guide to 22 million to 26 million units or would it be a little higher?
John F. Coyne: I think, Mark, Tim indicated that the immediate constraint for us as we enter November here is the slider fab capacity that is currently offline. And we're making concerted efforts to take that away from being -- become the first constrained item. Next set of items are components. And as Tim said, I think it's too early. We are beginning to develop a reasonable understanding of how that component availability and the actions in train in our supply base affect WD. It's still ongoing in terms of -- many supplier facilities are shut down in order to assure the safety of their employees and to allow time to try to protect equipment and so on. But those facilities may or may not be subsequently inundated and the surrounding roads and access may or may not be passable in the near future. So it's a very developing situation that we're watching. Right now, there's a significant degree of uncertainty as you saw in Wolfgang's numbers around our estimates as to what we can accomplish. And frankly, we're much more concerned about that and our ability to support our customers and to restore our business than we are in looking at what's going on in the rest of the industry.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe you could focus on the fundamentals from the prior quarter, December quarter. Could you just weigh in, if you could, in terms of the desktop, trend line. Desktop seems to be a little different than usual in terms of the sequential movement. Was that related to more and more ocean shipments in the prior quarter, or back-to-school and holiday season? Or what was going on there?
John F. Coyne: I don't think there was anything out of line with expectations. I mean, we saw flattish desktop and a little bit of growth in notebook. But pretty much in line with expectations right across the mix of products and markets and I think we had said 170 to 175, we came in at 176 for the market. And I don't think there was anything significant in kind of pattern changes within that market. Maybe one little thing, Europe was maybe a tad stronger than we expected and the U.S. was maybe a tad weaker than we expected.
Operator: The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Is it fair to assume that March quarter constraints could be more severe than the December quarter, just given your entering this quarter with an inventory buffer?
John F. Coyne: Yes, I think the inventory buffer is right through the pipeline, so you would have to estimate that, that would be the case. Because people, in our case, some of our inventory obviously is compromised because of the flooding. In others, they probably have more inventory and the pipeline can use it. And the same thing from the suppliers, had inventory in the pipeline that is currently getting used. So you would have to surmise that the -- that it would be more difficult in the next quarter than in the current quarter. Plus, I think people in this quarter tend to bring a little bit heavier inventory of finished goods because it's front-end loaded. And so consequently, there's probably a little bit of tailwind from that too that might be there from other quarters. So yes, I believe so.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Tim, that makes sense. And last question from me. Is there anything you can say at this point on the timing of what the integration with HGST would look like and how much exposure does HGST have to Thailand?
John F. Coyne: I mean the timing, we're eagerly awaiting for the time-out of the EU process, 30th of November. We're working very hard with all the other regulatory authorities to try to bring them to a conclusion around about the same time. And we will, as soon as we have regulatory clearance, be looking to consummate the transaction as soon as possible. In terms of Hitachi's footprint in Thailand, we believe that their 2 facilities, significant I think probably a little less to Thailand's output relative to total output than WD. And those facilities are outside of the current flood area. As to their supply lines and so on, we have no information.
Operator: Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I wondered if you could just speak to what you think happens to pricing if the TAM is called 170 million units but components -- there are some components that are 60% out of Thailand, I mean there's going to be a material gap in the availability of drives. What happens to pricing you think in the December and March quarters with what looks like to be very severe shortages of drives?
John F. Coyne: Again, we're going to have to look at the basics behind what drives it, what drives pricing. And obviously, supply is a significant factor. But as well as that, there will be extraordinary efforts carried out by everybody in order to try and see if they can get as much volume into the supply chain as possible. And that will require expediting charges, it will require logistical charges and it will require a significant amount of extra effort, probably extra overtime working and just to mention a few. So that will have to be recovered in the pricing by the people that are doing those extraordinary efforts. And we will have to give some simply monies to the suppliers in order to be able to do that also. So it will be -- I think there'll be upward pressure on pricing right through the supply chain.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Let me ask a follow-up then, if I could. If you took the choice of buying new equipment and trying to integrate equipment and drive facilities, what's that process timeline?
John F. Coyne: So it depends on the type of equipment. And if it's a test equipment for instance. And in our case, if you look at what has been submerged, the fiber fab equipment has been submerged. Obviously, we've had some test equipment submerged although we have electronics removed from that. And some HGA [ph] equipment, although that's a relatively small percentage of our total volume. So in the case of test equipment probably can be done. If you are to replace it with new equipment, probably can be done in the 3 to 5 month region. Assembly equipment can probably be done -- again, making assumptions that the people that make this equipment are not dependent on the componentry [ph] and selection [ph] around the affected areas. And then if it has anything to do with wafer- and fab-type equipment, it's obviously a longer lead time. Probably, you're talking about somewhere in the 9- to 12-month region in that particular case.
Operator: Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: How should we think about how this potential impacts your future product transitions and the roadmap for 2012? Or at least how should we think about this? And I recognize that this is an unprecedented and very unfortunate situation to try to make these types of predictions.
John F. Coyne: I think that's an area we're also very focused on. I think Wolfgang's OpEx guidance gives you some hint as to how we're thinking about that, we're viewing this entirely differently from the 2008 economic collapse, where we were looking at a projected fall-off in demand and sizing our business appropriately. We're looking at this as a short-term interruption of our ability to manufacture. The demand side of our equation continues to be highly robust and our challenge is how to address that as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible. So we're committed to ensuring that when we get back into full production, we're producing up-to-the-minute products that are responsive to customer need at that time. So we're continuing our investment in engineering, we're fairly focused on expanding activity here in the short term in our U.S. prototype manufacturing facilities and we will be carving out a piece of the Malaysia manufacturing capacity, which is currently dedicated to future products and product development. And that will be maintained focused on future product development.
Operator: Kevin Hunt with Auriga.
Kevin M. Hunt - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: I just have a follow-up question on the Hitachi transaction. Will there be any reason why this would affect -- the issue in Thailand will affect that? And how -- maybe you can help us understand how that might impact your integration of the Hitachi, assuming it will have some impact?
John F. Coyne: I think the flexibility that a post-combination environment gives us relative to mixing and matching of available parts, of all available production tooling, et cetera, getting this deal done quickly is very beneficial to the overall return of the industry supply and, therefore, very beneficial to customers. So all of the things that we said about the deal and why it was good for our customers, good for us, good for our employees, good for our suppliers, all of those things hold true and have been amped up by the current situation. So we're very eager to get to grips with this and immediately move into a consummated deal that can get regulatory approval.
Operator: Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division: I guess, to that end as well, John, is that sort of another way of saying that, this could actually help push the deal through -- kind of push it through faster maybe than, you know, 4 weeks ago?
John F. Coyne: Well, I would certainly hope so. And that I believe the regulators would view their role as being to protect the consumer. And I see no better way to protect the consumer than making high-quality product highly available. And so I would hope they would adopt that view. We will certainly be pushing in that direction. And if we continue to work with them to propose what we believe are clear benefits of the deal.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division: And then to that end, recognizing that there's not great visibility into the [indiscernible] circumstances, to what extent, if any, might the situation in Thailand impact -- I guess, what you and Hitachi had envisioned sort of together in terms of production, integration, sharing, things of that nature as being an important part of the, I guess, of the accretive benefit of the deal?
John F. Coyne: I don't think there's any. I mean, the deal -- we did the deal as a long-term deal and we believe that current situation is a -- I don't want to downplay it. It's very serious situation, but it is short term in nature and we will recover from it. And we view the benefits of the deal as long term but the quicker we get the deal done, the faster we're going to access those benefits and pass them on to our customer base.
Operator: Joe Yoo with Citi.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I actually want to go back to the inventory levels at the OEM jet hubs. You talked about 2 weeks. But my sense is that during the end of the quarter, generally, that inventory level goes down seasonally because OEMs pull more inventory than usual. Is that a correct assessment?
John F. Coyne: It's probably correct that some of the OEMs tend to skinny out inventory a bit at the end of their quarter. But most of the OEM volume that we support has different quarter ends than us. They're offset by a month, so the major -- a number of the major OEMs are -- this month are in their run end to the end of their quarter.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it. My second question's for Wolfgang. If you look at the revenue and the unit guidance, am I correct in calculating that ASPs will actually go down meaningfully sequentially? So I wanted to reconcile your comments on pricing potentially being favorable with your ASP's sequential decline.
Wolfgang U. Nickl: No, I think you need to review the math. In the revenue guidance, there's a small portion of products that are not price-dependent in there as well but implied in our guidance is marginally increased pricing.
Operator: Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess, I want to ask kind of beyond just the equipment restart time, what is the process as far as you guys having roughly 50% of your revenue coming from 10-key customers. What's the process of qualification or the cycle for that matter as you turn facilities back on? Because I think some of the OEMs qualify not only just the drive but the actual manufacturing facility, the equipment and even the upstream suppliers. So how does that factor into the time to recover, I guess, is the question?
John F. Coyne: I think the -- typically, yes, we have an internal qualification process that as we bring up any new facility or any new piece of equipment, there's a prescribed process that we go through to validate it. And I'm very confident given the discussions I've had with all of our major customers over the past several days as this situation has emerged, that with the strong support we're receiving from all of our customers that we will work out a parallel process where our bring-up qualifications are done in parallel with the customers' requirements so that, as we're ready to press the go button, everybody will be satisfied that, that is a controlled, high-quality, ready-for-mass volume situation and we won't lose any time by overlapping -- by doing those qualifications sequentially.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow up, just looking at the guidance again, looking at the numbers, it's pretty clear that you're assuming no, if not a negative gross margin. So I guess the question on that was, I think, historically, Western Digital's very been effective in leveraging a variable cost structure. Can you help us understand how much of your COGS line is kind of variable in nature relative to fixed and kind of gauge that overhead that basically lack of utilization presents on the gross margin line?
Wolfgang U. Nickl: Yes, I'll give you a couple of pointers. First of all, you're right, the guidance actually implies negative gross margin. We're dealing with a substantial portion of what we will call fixed cost. You know, what the depreciation is but there's a very significant factor, the infrastructure, that will stay there since it's a small, short-term issue to deal with. Then we're also dealing with certain costs that you would ordinarily describe as variable but they're already sticky because we're paying our workforce in Thailand, for instance. And then you're dealing with cost related to your input materials. Those are from a mix between internal and external components and then a general, I think you mentioned it, expediting of input materials and that's all affected in the mass. But you're right, it's a negative gross margin.
Operator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I understand there's really no historical precedence for this, but how do you in the industry decide over the next couple of quarters how to allocate the much smaller number of units across the various channels, OEMs distribution and retail. Because it seems like OEMs could gobble up everything that's available and still be supply-constrained. And so is this strategy to give everything you can to OEMs? Or do you feel like you need to fairly balance the units available across all of the channels?
John F. Coyne: In looking at satisfying our customer base, we will focus on being fair and equitable to all branches of our business. The business that's prosecuted directly under the Western Digital brand, as well as that of our OEMs and that of our distribution partners. And to that end, we stopped shipments last weekend in order that we could get our arms around where everything is and ensure that as we began shipping again, that product was allocated appropriately to the long-term established business partnerships in our customer base.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think you said the vast majority of your slider production is in Thailand. Is that to the tune of 90%? Is it that high? And are there third parties that you could work with that could supply you that component?
John F. Coyne: It's not that high. But it is a majority, the substantial majority of our production. And yes, we are working with partners, have been working with partners for some time to rapidly ramp our partnership accessible capacity. And also, we're working to execute plans to bring some of our own capacity back up in short order.
John F. Coyne: Well, thank you all very much for tuning in to the call today. As you can imagine, we'll be highly focused in the weeks and months ahead to ensure the continued well-being of our employees and to complete our business recovery from this significant but temporary setback. And we will keep you informed of our progress. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's call. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2011 Q4  (2011-07-21 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention at the offset that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry conditions in the September quarter, including the total available market for hard drives, customer demand, supply constraints, capacity mix, average selling price and cost of components, expected benefits from and the timing of completion of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth in the near-line enterprise market, our product offerings in the traditional enterprise market, our position in the branded products market, our expected capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2012, our investments in new products and markets and our financial results expectations for the September quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 2, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.  In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. Investors are encouraged to consider the reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures we provide during this call and those that are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.  The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction and following the close of the transaction. Because these acquisition-related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.  Also as a reminder, until our acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and Hitachi GST remain independent companies. So we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance today.  I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.  I now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.
John Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.  In the June quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling of seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake.  The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition.  This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recession snapback year of 2010, combined with the slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets.  We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons: An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macro reinvestment cycle; the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending; the planned launch of redesigned, feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud.  In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more, reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods of below model performance are typically followed by a return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur.  Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market, an improved solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011 and our integration planning activities continue on schedule.  I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?
Timothy Leyden: Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this.  Margin focus across the PC market where lower financing and inventory-carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight, leading to pull-ins of built schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to pull-forwards by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at it than looking for it. We now see an industry TAM for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 million to 175 million.  Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period, as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post earthquake challenges, again, providing superior availability and value to our customer base. Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year for the June quarter.  Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and is some 300 basis points below the same period last year.  Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but higher volumes, tight cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance.  Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, net income was $158 million and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million.  Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year.  The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 million to 6.4 million units, and up from 5.1 million units year-on-year. Cloud computing continues to spur growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market, at 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters.  In the traditional enterprise space, we are servicing a limited customer set with our first- and second-generation SAS products, and we are on plan to bring our third-generation product to market within the calendar year.  The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year-ago quarter, as a sequential TAM reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year TAM unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. Competition is particularly intense in the branded segment, as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity.  In the DVR market segment, the TAM was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units into this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs helped us grow in this segment where HDDs offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content.  The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment.  Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and the pull forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to the HDD supply chain inventory status, we believe that inventory levels continued to build in the PC OEM supply chain as the switch from air freight to sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. OEMs continued to pull product on the basis of concerns about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season.  In our other served markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are: A branded products volume increase; a DVR volume reduction and flattish volume in the Enterprise segment.  Now turning to our product lineup. We are now shipping the WD Scorpio 1 terabyte, a 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in a range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes-per-platter technology. In our Branded Products segment, we continue to lead the industry in volume shipments of USB 3. In our Consumer Electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabyte and 3 terabyte SATA hard drives.  I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?
Wolfgang Nickl: Thank you, Tim. A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call.  For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior-year period and the March quarter.  Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire Network Kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 23% from the prior year and seasonally down 34% from the March quarter.  These results are above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities.  Hard drive average selling price was approximately $44 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter.  Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD Livewire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing environment, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonally by 13% from the March quarter. There was one customer, Dell, that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue.  Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as we grew to 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined.  Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenue, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue.  Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a function of firmer pricing in the client compute market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter.  R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses.  Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, versus $215 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses.  Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0.  Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income.  Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share, as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management.  Capital expenditures for the June quarter totaled $153 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter totaled $150 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million.  For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer fab facility. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal '12.  We made a $31 million debt repayment during the June quarter, and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $294 million. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, an increase of $260 million from the March quarter.  Let me now turn to our expectations for the September quarter. As Tim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 million and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEMs have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs.  The actual TAM depend on the level of back-to-school sales and the expectation for PC demand for the holiday season and the consequent decisions of PC OEMs on optimizing their ocean-to-air freight mix and build plants.  Market segment mix will reflect typical seasonal patterns, which will mean an increase in branded product shipments, a decrease in DVR product shipments and flat enterprise volume.  Price declines are expected to be moderate while cost pressures will continue, driven by a rare earth materials, logistics costs and foreign currency exposures. We will continue to work internally and with our supplier partners to find ways to offset these cost challenges.  We continue investing in innovation to support growth in new products and markets. Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses.  Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: I guess, the first thing I wanted to ask is, I guess, just on the rare earth issue. Obviously, you guys, did a better job of offsetting somehow or absorbing the costs than Seagate did last night. Can you talk about some of the dynamics, I guess, that have allowed you to do that seemingly in the June quarter and the September quarter guidance? And I know you're not giving December quarter guidance. If you could give us any sense of the degree to which sort of those levers might be able to sort of continue through the balance of the second half of the year?
John Coyne: Yes, Ananda. This is John. On an overall basis, the rare earth materials that affect both the magnetic components in our drives and the processing of substrates for our media are -- have 2 issues. One is overall availability and consequent to that, the price for that availability. The market -- about 30% of the reserves exist in China. About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3 China; 1/3 U.S.; 1/3 rest of world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers, multi-tier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage cost. We continue to focus on the controllables, that we manage the design of the product and therefore, the usage of these materials. The processing in the supply chain, to manufacture the components where you acquire and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we've worked with our supply chain to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully countervailed those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers and we've sought their help in reflecting, in our pricing, the cost increase which we could not offset in other areas. And we'll continue to do that as we march into the future here. We'll continue to try to manage down usage, to improve efficiency and utilization throughout the chain and find other means within our overall control to continually address cost improvement, which is quarterly order of business, daily order of business here. And should all of that not successfully drive down the cost of a hard drive, we'll work with our customers to ensure that we continue to provide a very fundamenta,l, effective technology to the marketplace that enables the revenue streams of all of our companies.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: Okay, that's helpful. If I can just ask one clarification, if I could, John. Any -- I guess, would you care to give us any sense of how much of a headwind, gross margin headwind the rare earth might have been this quarter? And is it too early to get any sort of sense of, I guess for, sort of for the December quarter -- I mean, it sounds like you feel like you have pretty sound principals around working with the suppliers and with your customers in offsetting some of the costs. Is there any chance that we can get surprised, I guess, by any meaningful degree as we move through the fall in the degree to which you're able to work with the suppliers in those processes and [indiscernible]?
John Coyne: Well, I think the issue here is there's always a certain time lag in this process. And the vulnerability is to a very rapid increase in pricing of the materials. And recognize in these kinds of situations, there are 2 issues. One is the price rise that relates to the demand versus the supply equation. And we think we were helped last quarter by the disarray in the Japanese automotive industry, which reduced demand for magnets in automotive temporarily. But that will come back, as the supply chain to the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side, primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver of cost. The other is typically, when any traded commodity goes short, we get financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even scarcer and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well. And we're working to try to manage all of that. And I think our customers fully understand that supply chain and those issues and fully understand the vital contribution of our technology to their businesses and we'll work it out.
Operator: Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A couple as well. First question, there's a debate out there with regard to what the TAM looks like for the September quarter. I notice you guys have laid out 170 million to 175 million. You clearly pointed to a lack of good visibility through the full quarter. Can you tell us what your assumption or what underlying assumption you're making with regard to trends into the month of September relative to historical trends to get at that guidance where you're at -- that you've laid out?
Timothy Leyden: Yes, this is Tim. What we believe is that the inventory that's being carried on the ocean, people have made a call on that on the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to put product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school season in order to see whether back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that, if it meets the expectations, they'll continue to put product on the ocean for the holiday season, we believe. If the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to air freight in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think that there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is that extra inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing, the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think that with that in mind, there normally would have been -- what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends, probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And under this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory buffer that's in there would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then coming off the heels of your competitor last night, I'd be curious of where you guys stand. I know you've made some announcements this week with regard to -- when you guys make announcements, 500 gig-per-platter, 2.5 and then also 1 terabyte, 3.5-inch, can you update us exactly where you're at and whether or not you've seen similar challenge as far as time to maturity or time to cost effectiveness, if you will, on those platform ramps?
John Coyne: I think -- this is John again. The WD approach to the deployment of new technology is to focus primarily on deploying that technology, where it serves a specific need in the marketplace, such as a new capacity point that has been previously inaccessible or, as in the case of our announcement last night, a -- the 1 terabyte in the 9-millimeter form factor, which is restricted to 2 disks. And therefore, deploying the advanced technology in that product enables us to offer a 1-terabyte capacity into the notebook environment, which is restricted to the 9.25-millimeter form factor. We then -- we tend to manage our large-scale deployment of the technology, which is purely to address cost on existing capacity points. We manage that very much on the metrics, and we pace the introduction of that technology and the ramp of that technology to return the maximum financial advantage to the company. And I think you've seen how we've managed that over the last 5, in fact, 10 years. It's a very effective, proven formula, and we continue to prosecute that formula.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then final question from me and I'll cede the floor. On the pending acquisitions, I know you've talked about some regulatory approvals you've gotten. How do we think about timing of other key regulatory approvals? I mean, is there's a specific time frame -- October, November that we should be looking for as kind of driving this to that close of Q4?
John Coyne: I think based on the published time frames for each of the agencies, the U.S. process is moving along a track that's going to be in the September time frame. And the European process is moving along a track that looks like the October time frame. And we expect all regulatory agencies reviews to be complete within the calendar year.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Just a couple questions. We've seen increasing shipments by ocean freight from the OEMs for a number of quarters now. And so it seems to be here to stay. Can you estimate in any way what the industry's total volume that might be shipped by ocean freight is today? Is it a substantial amount such that it creates enough confusion about what inventory is actually out there? And then secondly, if ocean freight does continue, what is the new normal for seasonality as it seems to level out to quarters? I mean, can then -- can you keep your CapEx different than it has been in the past because of that?
John Coyne: Good questions, Rich. We're working on trying to understand the split, the air-ocean split. I think it's above 20% today, maybe in the 30% range and rising. In perspective, the PC industry ships over 1 million units a day. So -- and you consider a 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain, air versus ocean to -- from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 million or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at the end of March that we thought there were about 8 million drives out there, a mismatch between PCs sold through and drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units during the course of the last quarter. So you're probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's -- provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter-to-quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air-ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for -- at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody in the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. The negative is that it reduces visibility and typically makes reaction to downside a more severe, short, sharp, shock thing. As Tim described our thinking on the upcoming quarter, we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that therefore, the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school is shaping up like, then that will either continue to plan or they'll put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on any of these minor miscalculations, right? So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Okay, great answer. And just one last question on consumer electronics and branded. Obviously, everyone's been concerned about the low-end PC market, the Consumer segments, the notebook side. But your Branded and Consumer business actually hasn't been that bad. It hasn't fallen as much as, perhaps, the PC side. What would you attribute that to? Do think that the consumer market is buying these backup drives, for example, for existing PCs, and there's just a recognition that they should be backing up? Or are you able to gain share? Or -- there isn't a whole lot of visibility into that market, so any color you could provide would be helpful.
John Coyne: Well, our research into that market tells us that we still haven't effectively publicized or proselytized the backup story. There's still way, way too many people out there totally exposed in terms of backup. What we have seen is the deployment of what I call the personal cloud, where the continuing appetite for consumption of rich content, whether that be on PCs, on tablets, is leading to a significant level of sales for personal storage to expand the storage available in the home. And parallel to that, we're seeing expansion of storage in the cloud, which is driving the growth in the nontraditional enterprise space. And so, the growth of outside the PC storage is reflecting the huge growth in petabyte demand and the creation of content, which is you're driving that 40% year-over-year growth in petabytes of storage demand. And one place it shows up is in the external storage. Now if we can do an effective marketing job of convincing people that not only do they need that incremental storage, but they need to back it all up, then we have an even brighter future out there to go turn that opportunity into financial performance.
Operator: Mark Miller with Noble Financial.
Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.: I'm just looking at trying to compare, it looked like you had a similar ASP decline percentage-wise to your competitor, but it looks like your cost per drive unit was significantly better. Was there any product mix or any difference in sourcing of components externally, say, heads and media? Or could this difference be explained by your better management of the rare earth material issue?
Wolfgang Nickl: No, we had moderate price declines as we mentioned. I think you need take into consideration the increase in volume as well. We had good utilization of our assets, and we had decent cost declines. And as Tim mentioned, our channel and business segment mix was pretty much as expected.
Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.: So better operational performance. I've heard recently from some people in the industry that the transition to energy-assisted magnetic recording is kind of moving up. And I'm hearing things about maybe second half of next year. Can you give me kind of a feeling for that? Is that getting pulled in somewhat? Or is that still roughly 2 years out?
John Coyne: I think that's a difficult technology. We -- the industry is demonstrating the technology and has been for several years. But typically, in this kind of technology area, when you see the announcements of the new technology performing at the current level of the mature technology, you can add 3 years to volume availability of that new technology. And we have not yet reached the point of equivalence to the current technology in the lab demos that are demonstrating the new technology. So it's at least 3 years out for mass volume deployment.
Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.: Okay. And just my prior question. I understand, so there wasn't really any major change in the outsourcing of media or heads from previous quarters?
John Coyne: No.
Operator: Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insight.
Nehal Chokshi: Your near-line shipments were up about 8% q-over-q and year-over-year, whereas the industry near-line shipments were up 14% q-over-q and 28% year-over-year. So looks like market share here is declining. I was hoping you can provide some color as far as what's going on here and hopefully remedies that you have in the pipeline here.
Timothy Leyden: Actually, quarter-to-quarter, we did grow market share in the near-line enterprise. We continue to execute in that marketplace. We have -- we are shipping our near-line SAS, and we're on track with our product introductions. We are working on a few things in order to get a higher profitability on it. But overall, we're pretty pleased with where we are in that particular space.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Splitting to the segments, the DVR shipments, up very significantly. That does not seem to be market-driven. It seems to be market share-driven. Can you talk a little bit as far as what's going on there as well?
Timothy Leyden: Yes. With the product capabilities that we have and the -- some of the disruption that was in the marketplace during the course of the quarter, we were able to react to customer upside in that marketplace, and we're able to do so effectively. So consequently, it contributed to increased volume for us.
Nehal Chokshi: Does that also have anything to do with the proposed M&A activity in the -- going on? Or that's purely just upside customer demand for your specific products?
Timothy Leyden: Well, we wouldn't be able to separate out that from normal activity. So consequently, we believe it was due to our ability to be able to execute quicker than the competition.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. My final question was that Seagate indicated that their CapEx will be at their low end of their model. So without the wafer fab conversion, where would you guys be at with respect to your CapEx in terms of the percent of revenue?
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes. In general, we tailor capital towards flexibility to respond to demand and to technology and be very reactive in realtime in reacting to capacity increases. We put the upper end out because we complete the wafer fab conversion. Without it, we would probably have been more in the middle of the range. But it's also important to point out that we're focusing strongly on linearity of capital spending. And what we actually will end up spending will largely depend on our view at the beginning of next calendar year, how the second half of next calendar year will look like.
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Two questions. If I take the midpoint of your guidance in terms of the operating metrics, I get to around 20% gross margin. Wolfgang or John, can you kind of talk about what could be the swing factors that can maybe apply further upward pressure to gross margin as you navigate the September quarter? Is it really just about getting greater visibility on the back-to-school in the month of September or is it something else?
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes. I think you're right. First of all, the midpoint is 20.5%, so 18% to 23%. You'd usually expect in the second half of the calendar year to be in the upper end of that range. As we said, price declines are moderate, so it will depend to a large degree how well we can work internally and with our supplier partners to mitigate some of the cost challenges. And then Tim pointed out that back-to-school is important and the outlook of how the PC OEMs will look at the holiday season will trigger certain build and shipment mode decisions, which could have an impact on volume.
Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. The second question is around the notebook market. John or Tim, can you talk about trying to reconcile your sequential growth in the June quarter versus your competitor, Seagate. It just seems like their 25.5% sequential growth is rather humongous. And does that present any challenges to the market going forward? Or was there just some sort of onetime event there that happened and that's kind of in their review mirror?
John Coyne: Well, I think our performance in 2.5-inch for last quarter was supply-constrained. We did call out in our April call that as a consequence of the earthquake, we were scrambling to underpin and by the end of April, had underpinned our planned 2.5-inch volumes and support of customers for the June quarter. We did execute to that plan and we did support all of the preplanned volumes there. But we had no upside in 2.5. In fact, we were somewhat constrained. We shipped more to support our OEM customers and we constrained ourselves in allocation to our Branded business, which is part of the reduction in our Branded business quarter-over-quarter. But that's not a constraint as we look forward.
Operator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Just a quick follow-up on gross margins first. Do you have a sense for where your gross margin would have been in September, if not for some of the higher component costs in rare earth issues? Would it -- is it 50 basis points or is it more than that?
John Coyne: I mean, it's hard to say that. I don't think -- I think the overall, if you take the baseline of the beginning of the year and look at the current cost of the rare earth materials and how much of them we used in shipping the average drive, I think the 200-basis point number that was used yesterday is pretty close. And then it's a matter of how much you can offset of that in usage, efficiency, utilization and how much then we're forced to share with our customer base and how timely we can make all of that understanding at action. And you can see the extent to which we've accomplished that in the last quarter. And the upcoming quarter guidance, I think, it's all implied in there.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And you mentioned that the integration planning is on schedule. Does that mean that even with the deal closing a quarter later than you originally expected that you can hit those initial integration targets from a timing schedule? Or does everything get pushed by 3 months or so?
John Coyne: Well, everything is on a day 0 start schedules, so depending what the closing date is, there's then a process, which will -- initial process will be about 6 months to get the thing -- to get us integrated and most of the integration actions taken and then, it will take realistically another year after that to really get the full benefits of the new WD in terms of operational performance. And then over the next 5 years, you'll see the impact of our ability to increase effective investment in the fundamental technologies and product breadth that will allow us to further grow the business.
Operator: Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: John, could you talk a little bit about your views? You mentioned the TAM this quarter. What can the industry ship to? In other words, where would there be constraints that would come up? And do you sense that any of your competitors still have supply constraints?
John Coyne: There's-- I mean, we think the 170 million, 175 million can be supported. We think there may be some continuing constraints, primarily in the semiconductor side of the supply line. And it's a very deep, multi-layer supply chain and there's probably still some things from level 5 or level 6 working their way through the system that are not fully understood yet. So proceeding with caution and taking what we believe are all the appropriate actions to ensure that we have closed credibility around the supplier commits relative to our forecast and our build plans. I've got to say I was impressed by the overall industry capability demonstrated in last quarter because immediately post-earthquake, I was a lot more pessimistic about the industry's and our ability to hit our numbers last quarter. And we managed to do better than we anticipated. And it looks like many of our competitors also did the same. So it's a credit to the resilience of the supply chain and the inventiveness and dedication of all of the people involved.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: There's -- it looks like in your Q4, calendar Q4, you're embedding the market TAM to be relatively flat. Is there is somehow a conservatism in there? Or is that more of the ship issues that you're thinking about for TAM that looks to be relatively flat in Q4?
John Coyne: Yes. That's the impact, we think, of the ocean versus air. When you're using historical demand patterns to shape your build and logistics and you extend the logistics piece by several weeks, then the normal tail-off that would happen in December potentially now happens in November. And we run at a somewhat lower rate in the December quarter because the holidays stuff's all been shipped already.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I got it, okay. My last one then is, again, John, for you. Where did the clock start ticking, you think, on the rare earth? And what I mean by that is, prices started moving up a few months ago. And on one side you have the Chinese government, but on the other, you have presumably capitalism at work. When do you think you could potentially see non-Chinese sources for the acquired rare earth metals? Is it a year from now? Is it 6 months from now? Just any kind of metrics on when you might get some help on these issues from the supply side.
John Coyne: Well, bringing the mine back into production is a protracted process. And we do see some work going on in Australia that potentially could begin to impact the market next year. And I -- we're going to work on the other side of that one to try to reduce usage per drive as a way to address some of that. And the thing that's driving some of the quota behavior and so on in China is that there's an amped-up increased focus on environmental impact of these mining and refining activities, where the weaker, less capable players are being forced out of the market because they're unable to meet environmental requirements. And it's the more capable companies that are redoing their process to make sure they're in compliance with the environmental standards. And so I think, it'll get worked out, but it may take a while. So in closing, I'd just like to thank all of you for joining us today. We do appreciate your questions and your interest in the company and in the industry, and we look forward to seeing again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning benefits expected from our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, industry conditions in the June quarter including the total available market for hard drives, customer demand, supply constraints, capacity mix, average selling price and cost of components, our presence in the traditional enterprise market, our expected capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2011. The terms of and our ability to syndicate our new credit facility to be entered into in connection with our planned acquisition of HGST, and our financial results expectations for the June quarter including revenue gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.  These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 28, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.  In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of HGST. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor summary, included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively for the Form 8-K, we have furnished to the SEC today. Copies of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the investors relations section of our website.  The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction. And following the closing of the transaction. Because these acquisition related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.  Finally, as a reminder, until our acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business nor its financial performance. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.
John Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer.  First and foremost, we were pleased to determine in early March that Western Digital employees in Japan, as well as those of Hitachi GST were all safe after the tragic events of last month. Those personally affected by these events continue to be in our thoughts.  Like many technology companies, we have been busy dealing with the disruptions resulting from the events in Japan. We are also proceeding on plan with our acquisition of HGST and have made significant progress on that front. We are in the approval process with all required regulatory agencies. Our integration planning is well underway and we have successfully syndicated the loan financing associated with the transaction. We remain very excited about the potential of this acquisition.  Industry shipments came in at 160 million units for the March quarter, slightly above our original expectation of 155 million units. As customers accelerated product purchases in the last 3 weeks the quarter due to supply concerns as a result of the Japanese earthquake. Analyzing the effects of the events in Japan, on the technology industry generally, there were, and remain a number of supply chain challenges, which are impacting both demand and supply visibility in the June quarter and beyond.  Tim will describe these in more detail. But I am pleased that the WD team with strong support from our suppliers, has mitigated the initial impact on our ability to support pre-earthquake customer share awards for the June quarter. We have now turned our attention to responding to customer upside requests for this quarter, which we believe are driven by unresolved supply chain issues at competitors and to fully supporting customer needs in the September quarter. We believe end customer demand for the June quarter in all markets for HDDs is tracking to seasonally normal patterns.  However, there is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to supply chain challenges. In uncertain times like these, we believe a highly flexible and responsive WD business model is especially well-equipped to perform and deliver value to our customers and shareholders.  I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational challenges and highlights in the March quarter in greater detail. Tim?
Timothy Leyden: Thank you, John. Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call. Responding to the unexpected increase in TAM, triggered by the series of uncertain supply in the last few weeks of the quarter, our adaptable model enabled us to react rapidly to the upturn in demand and satisfy the actual TAM of 160 million units.  Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected. Overall product capacity mix was relatively flat with tight cost management enabled us to come in at the high-end of our implied gross margin guidance. We shipped 49.8 million units in the March quarter, down 4.6% sequentially and 2.5% from the year ago period. While the overall market declined by 4.8%, and 2.3%, respectively.  Revenues totaled $2.25 billion. Gross margin was at 18.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $146 million. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $313 million.  Now turning to the overall market. In the compute space, units decreased sequentially from 116 million to 112 million. And decreased year-on-year from 119 million. We believe that the softer demand in the March quarter was driven to some extent by the late supply of CPUs to PC ODMs. Commercial demand strength continued, while consumer demand remained subdued.  Against this backdrop, WD shipped 36.3 million units into the compute space in the March quarter, compared to 37.8 million units in the December quarter, and 38.5 million units in the year ago quarter, as we maintained essentially flat market share in all three periods. And the airline enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.4 million to 5.6 million units, and up from 5.2 million units year-on-year. Driven by the expansion of cloud computing, this market continues to offer further growth opportunity. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units remained flat with the December quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.4 million units, reflecting the continued strength of the commercial market.  The shift to 2.5-inch SaaS continued, as a percentage of total market represented by this platform has now advanced to around 54% of the TAM. WD shipped 2.3 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the March quarter.  Essentially flat with the December and year ago quarters. We continue to put the building blocks in place to increase our presence in the traditional enterprise space, and we're shipping out second-generation SaaS product to a limited customer set, and we continue to work on our third generation product.  The HDD manufacturers TAM in the branded product segment came in at 13 million units. Seasonally down from 14.7 million units in the December quarter and up from 10.7 million units in the year ago quarter, presenting continued evidence of strong demand for personal storage.  The seasonal cadence of this market is such that sell-in exceeds sell-through during the December quarter. In order to have adequate inventory in place for the holiday and post-holiday sales, whereas sell-through exceeds sell-in during the March quarter as distributors and retailers lighten up on inventory in preparation for the seasonally weaker June quarter.  WD shipped 6.4 million units into this market in the March quarter, down from 7.4 million units in the December quarter and up from 5.6 million units in the year ago quarter. We continue to compete strongly in this market segment where our brand equity, product lineup and differentiating features have earned us the leading position.  In the DDR market segment, the TAM was 13.5 million units, down sequentially from 14.3 million, and up from 12.1 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 4.7 million units into this market in the March quarter, essentially flat with the December quarter and up slightly from 4.6 million in the year ago quarter. WD's product capabilities resonates with customers in this segment, and we continue to see growth opportunities as HDDs offer the best value proposition to store and enjoy video content.  The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8 in strides. Inventories in the HDD supply-chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment.  Now turning to the June quarter. We believe that in an environment absent the impact of the Japanese earthquake, that the true demand for HDDs in the compute space would follow a seasonal demand patterns, and would be flat to down from the March quarter. However, given the likely impacts, we believe that HDD TAM in the June quarter will be supply constrained. Shortages at this point appear to be more acute in 2.5-inch drives but we expect the product will also be short in the 3.5-inch form factor.  Assuming that customer demand is not impacted by an inability to get other components that they need to build their systems. There are multiple levels of the supply chain at which availability problems may occur, from base chemicals up to final district components. And issues at each levels are still being worked by us, our suppliers, and our customers.  In the meantime, our customers are ordering what they can in order to reduce the number of their individual supply concerns. We are planning around a normal June quarter demand, and we have underpinned supply to satisfy that level of unit volume. We are now looking to support our customers with upside supply in response to their request as they try to bridge shortages from other HDD suppliers.  As John indicated, it is in uncertain times like these that WD's flexible and responsive models and our consistency and execution enable us to serve our customers well. In our other served markets, we expect volumes in DDR to be up seasonally, branded products to be down, and enterprise segments to be flat.  Now turning to our product line-up. We introduced new capacities for users of consumer network storage and high speed direct detach storage. We began populating our industry-leading My Book external drives with our 3 terabyte hard drives. Creative PC professionals and MAC enthusiasts, now can utilize the 6 terabyte My Book Studio Edition II storage systems to support their ever increasing production of HD content. This 2 drive storage system has 4 interfaces, including eSATA and FireWire 800 for the fastest transfer speeds, rate capability, and Apple Time Machine compatibility.  Our fast My Book Live network drive with a total capacity of 3 terabytes now centralizes more media than ever before in consumers' homes. We also added functionality to our WD TV Live media players, including CinemaNow, which provides users access to new release movies and TV episodes. New Netflix features, including the ability to search for movies and get recommendations directly on users' HDTV, as well as support for enhanced audio with Dolby Digital Plus.  I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q3 financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter.
Wolfgang Nickl: Thank you, Tim. A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q4 guidance after this call. Our Q3 actual results was slightly above the upper end of the guidance range we provided during our January investor call. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $2.25 billion, down 15% from the prior year and 9% sequentially. Authorized shipments totaled 49.8 million units, down 3% from the prior year period and 5% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD Life Wire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $50 million, up 8% from the prior year, and down 12% from the December quarter.  Average hard drive selling price was approximately $45 per unit, down $6 from the year ago quarter, and $2 from the December quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $441 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially. There was no single customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue.  Geographically the regions contributed roughly the same relative percentage of revenue as in the December quarter, with Asia's sales continuing to represent the majority of our revenue. From a channel perspective, retails percentage of revenue declined along seasonal expectations, while our OEM percentage increased slightly. Our gross margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 25.2% in the year ago quarter, and 19.2% in the December quarter.  The quarter-over-quarter reduction of gross margin by 100 basis points is a function of a seasonal decline in our branded products business and some cost of under absorption of our manufacturing assets due to a reduced build plan. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $252 million, including $10 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of HGST. Excluding these acquisition-related expenses, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $242 million or 10.7% of revenue. This compares with $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the year ago quarter, and $235 million or 9.5% of revenue in the December quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product development and higher incentive accruals.  Operating income was $158 million or 7% of revenue, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $168 million or 7.5% of revenue. This compares with $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $240 million or 9.7% of revenue in the December quarter.  Net interest and other nonoperating income was $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $13 million or 8.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $146 million or $0.62 per share, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income totaled $156 million or $0.66 per share. This compares with $400 million or $1.71 per share and $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables, 28 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 73 days of payables. We generated $313 million in cash flow from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $138 million. Capital expenditures for the March quarter totaled $175 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $151 million.  We have lowered our forecast for capital expenditures and depreciation. We now expect our capital spending for the current fiscal year to be between $775 million and $800 million, including approximately $100 million for our 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditure to optimize the output from our Singapore media facility we acquired last year.  Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be about $610 million for the current fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning carryover spending of up to $100 million for 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion in Singapore media facility optimization. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the third quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $325 million. We exited fiscal Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, an increase of $120 million from the December quarter.  Before I talk about our Q4 guidance, let me update you on the progress we made on the debt financing related to our planned acquisition of HGST. The cash portion of the purchase price will come from available offshore cash and new debt. Our existing term loan will be repaid from available cash balances. The new debt will not be rated but will have terms similar to investment rate debt and covenants that are very similar to what we have now. The new credit facility will consist of a term loan of up to $2.5 billion, and a $500 million revolving line of credit. We've fully negotiated the definitive loan documents with the Syndicate members and subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the acquisition in accordance with its terms, we fully expect all of the Syndicate members to be part of the final lender group.  The term loan and any amount drawn under the line of credit will carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our leverage ratio. We currently expect that margin to be 200 basis points.  Undrawn amounts on the revolver will carry a commitment fee of about 35 basis points, which will also vary according to our leverage ratio. The debt will not be funded until the acquisition closes. But we will be paying ticking fees on the $3 billion commitment at an annualized rate of 35 basis points between now and then. The loan will have a 5-year term with half of the principal being paid quarterly over that period and the other half being paid at maturity.  Let me now turn to our expectation for fiscal Q4. Absent the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we believe demand would have been flat to slightly down in line with historical seasonality. However, there are several factors that could alter that pattern, including our belief that hard drive suppliers will struggle to meet customer demand. Customers are still in discovery mode to establish which components may limit their ability to service their system-level customers.  If hard drives prove to be the bottleneck, we will be able to ship everything we can build. We estimate significant progress stabilizing our supply, and are confident that we can supply our customers what we committed to them prior to March '11. We expect better than seasonal capacity mix-up, moderate price declines and some cost increases for parts substitution and expedite charges.  Despite the fact that we're currently above our OpEx model, we continue to invest in our branded products portfolio, solid-state initiatives and fundamental technology capabilities. Our guidance does not include acquisition and financing related costs.  Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $245 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.65 for the June quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. So just a couple of questions for me. I guess first, when it comes to the Hitachi acquisition, I haven't been able to find a signed purchase agreement. Is that out there today? Is it something that we need to wait for, or am I just missing it?
John Coyne: It will be in the 10-Q, Rich.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, in terms of obviously Seagate's announcement about Samsung, do you expect this in any way to change how you talk about the deal with regulators? Or any comments on that?
John Coyne: Basically, no. We developed our transaction based on our belief that it will enhance our ability to provide value to customers through enhancement of the basic technology that's required to continue to deliver a high-quality, high reliability product portfolio, enables us to expand that product portfolio. The scale of the combined operations generates cost leverage and efficiencies, which we intend to share with our customers, and so we continue to be convinced that the acquisition of HGST is a very positive thing for WD's customers, for WD's employees, suppliers, and shareholders.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Okay and then the last question for me, just on Intel. Intel talked last night, continuing to refute some of the industry analysts' forecast on PCs. Saying that they still expect low double-digit growth for the entire industry. Do you have any revised color on what you're seeing or your discussions with the OEMs relative to that?
John Coyne: I think, Rich -- I think I mentioned in the last call my belief that the drive industry got a little ahead of itself in calendar year 2010 and shipped more product than the actual end demand consumer and commercial user level justified. And that likewise the PC industry also put a little too much inventory into the channel, particularly in consumer in the latter half of 2010. And that consequently, while the drive industry had 18% growth in 2010, over 2009, that I expected mid single-digit to high single-digit growth in the current year. And if you balance those two numbers, you would get a 2-year growth rate in the 10% to 12% level. I think that commentary is still valid. We believe that true end consumer demand, whether commercial or personal, continues to be in the range that Intel are reflecting in their commentary.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good afternoon. Your OEM customers have obviously seen the news of the HGST asset purchase. What insights, if any, have you garnered from the conversations you've had with your customers about being able to maintain market share of the combined business once the deal is done? Obviously you maintained compute shares this quarter, so it doesn't seem like there's been a disruption to date.
John Coyne: Yes, generally, our customer reaction in our conversations with customers immediately after we announced the acquisition of HGST has been very positive. I believe that the compelling value that they see in the deal is our ability to underpin the technology on a go-forward basis. Our ability to continue to innovate in terms of products useful to their future directions and the increased scale that will allow us to generate further cost benefits, and our willingness that we've exhibited over the last 10 years and will continue to do so to share those cost reductions with our customers to enable them to grow their markets. So very positive reaction.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Just one follow-up on your commentary about March and June, given your customers are already coming to you and asking for upside, can you help us understand what WD's typical strategy is in those discussions? Do you plan to offer that incremental product at a higher price? Do you ask them for guaranteed orders for the back half of the year? Are there any concessions that you can get from your customers given your ability to supply them the upside this quarter?
John Coyne: Obviously, we have been working with customers over many, many years to develop strong partnership relationships and a significant and key value that WD has brought to that table is our flexible and responsive model, and the consistency of our ability to overcome challenges and consistently deliver a high-quality product in a timely manner. That is one of the key values that has driven the WD share growth over the last 10 years. And our posture is to continue to deliver that value. Obviously, where that requires incremental cost, like all good partnerships, we want that to be a 2-way thing. Continuous price reduction in the marketplace is an ability we have to reduce prices is driven by an ability to consistently reduce cost. So where cost reduction takes a backseat to securing availability such as securing more expensive components, being involved in more expensive transport costs to expedite, paying expedite fees, those kinds of things we share with our customers typically. And they value our ability to deliver the product. And are therefore, willing to address those cost issues.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
John Coyne: That's as much color as I can give you.
Operator: Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Hi guys, thanks very much. I had a question on inventories and the implications. What do you think the OEM inventory status is of hard drives at present? And if you mention that folks are trying to catch up here, what do you think it implies for sequential growth patterns as supplies free up presumably in the September quarter? But how should we be thinking about a little further out in the June quarter in terms of the TAM growth as we look at September. Thanks.
Timothy Leyden: Okay, Keith, this is Tim. When we exited on the December quarter, we estimated that the OEMs had about 8 million to 10 million units in their inventory. Then during the course of the quarter, as we went through the CPU shortage, we think that they had reduction down to around 6 million to 8 million units. And then as we got into the March portion of the quarter, we believe that they built that back up to around 8 million to 10 million units as they got a bit concerned about supply. So we think that they finished up pretty much where they started at the beginning of the quarter. And then, when we look at the profile for the balance of the year, we believe there will be a supply constraint in both June quarter and in the September quarter. We think that in the December quarter, we'll be able to supply pretty much what the industry -- what the customers demand. So we think that the comfort level as far as inventory in the pipeline will not be able to be reached again until this quarter next year, the March quarter of next year.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So you think you'll be supply-constrained all the way to the end of December?
Timothy Leyden: We think we'll be supply-constrained in June and September, and then we think we'll be pretty much on equilibrium basis relative to what the customers want and what we can supply in the December quarter.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Fair enough. And then I'll sneak one more and if I can, against that -- you had some discussions about what you thought the TAM would be for calendar year '11 as we exited calendar year '10, I was just wondering if you might update us on thoughts there about what you think the TAM then looks like for calendar year '11?
Timothy Leyden: Yes, I think given what I just said. We had 160 pretty much 160 in the current quarter. I think the next two quarters will be somewhere around 155 each. And then we think that probably around 185 or so in the December quarter, so we think that given that profile, it'll be a supply constrained TAM and it'll be about 655 versus what the 650 in the last calendar year.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, I will see the floor. Many thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Rob Cihra with Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: Thanks very much. Two quick questions, if that's all right. The first, just that $10 million non-GAAP expense in the quarter, was that all in SG&A or was that in any of that in R&D?
John Coyne: Yes, it was all in SG&A.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: All SG&A. Okay, thanks. The other question would be just if you look at your, without getting into specifics of timing or anything, but to look at your sort of call it 1 terabyte per product [ph] desktop and 500 gig notebook and your cycles or industry cycles this year, is there any reason to think that those roadmaps change or impacted by either Japan and/or your HGST deal? Thanks.
John Coyne: Given the information that we have right now, we don't believe so.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Craig: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. A couple of questions. Wolfgang, maybe can you talk a little bit about the gross margin for the quarter. When you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I know you guys don't provide official guidance but if we backed into it for last quarter, you come out with a midpoint you upside a surprise versus your guidance essentially so maybe talk about the moving parts there. And the second part of my question is, as you're looking at the CapEx priorities and you've taken it down a little bit, what are the odds of that having to come a little bit lower, and where are you taking CapEx out of specifically, it's obviously not on the 6- and 8-inch wafers or the Singapore media, but maybe a little bit of color around that?
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, Scott. The sequential decline of gross margins from 19.2 to 18.2 are indeed a little bit better than what we had implied in our guidance. We pretty much saw the decline exactly how we had forecasted them, and again, mainly came from a segment mix, the branded businesses seasonally a bit down. And we had some absorption cost to deal with because we built fewer units in the March quarter than we did in the December quarter. And pricing overall probably came in a little bit better than we expected. I think we said on the call that we had like-for-like price declines in the model of 5%, and I would say they came in closer to 4.5%, so that's probably where the pickup came from. In terms of the CapEx, our priorities have not changed. Our capital is geared first and foremost towards ensuring our flexibility to service the market, our technology advancement, risk mitigation, and then we sold for incremental capacity. And we try to do the latter in as much as a just-in-time fashion as we can. And since volumes have come down a little bit, we're trying to be very prudent and try to invest as realtime as possible in capacity as we can.
Operator: Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Yes, thank you. Two questions. First Wolfgang, the guidance seems soft relative to the commentary about your ability to supply current OEM demand strength. Is there something I'm missing there?
Wolfgang Nickl: Historically, gross margin is down quarter-over-quarter in the June quarter over the March quarter. Like we said, we believe that we have underpinned the volume that we have committed. We believe that the pricing potentially driven by the swap markets is a little bit better. Price climbs are a little bit more benign than we have historically seen. So our implied margin is flat to slightly up, so we believe that is better than what we've historically seen, and our cost decline are somewhat limited because we have some increase cost due to the part substitutions that we have to do and expedite charges that we have to pay.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay, thank you. And last question, John, a question on Toshiba. In your opinion, are they willing and able to make significant investments?
John Coyne: Well, I can only refer you to their public utterances and they did put out a press release immediately after our announcement of the HGST acquisition, which indicated their belief that, that offered them significant opportunity to grow and expressed their willingness and desire to invest to accomplish that.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Thank you.
Operator: Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks. Couple of questions, so going back to your TAM assumptions for the full year, now it's 655, I think you were previously at 700 million, can you bridge the difference in those two numbers between the effects of Japan relative to be it a slowing PC environment or any other metrics that are in that?
Timothy Leyden: Well since it's all supply constrained as I indicated, I indicated that we were thinking we would be supply constrained or the industry would be supply constrained, in June and September. And then only able to satisfy pretty much what the demand was in December with no inventory pipeline filling, and that indicates that it's all Japan related.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. And then the second question, I know last quarter you guys talked about or you've been reiterating 7% to 8% of revenue for CapEx spend. Now you're saying 775 to 800, can you tell us how much of a reduction that looks to be and I guess on top of what looks to be a $100 million push-out in the spending related to the wafer upgrade?
Wolfgang Nickl: Yes, I think again in the 775 to 800 million units, you will have 100 million included for the 6 to 8-inch wafer conversion and for the upgrade of our Singapore facility to optimize the output there. If you would roughly take this over a Street consensus revenue, excluding the onetime wafer, we're probably more towards the 7%, which is a function of the lower volume output and our just-in-time investments there. And then part of the 6-to 8-inch investments are moving into next year and it could be up to 100 million there.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And final question from me. I know we talked a little bit about where you though OEM levels where for inventory. Can you talk about the pull from a distribution perspective for the final few weeks of March? And compare that relative to what a historical trend has been, and where we've exited the March quarter as far as channel inventory levels?
Timothy Leyden: General industry levels are below the 4- to 6-week target -- are bends that we normally talk about. And actually within that, both of the individual components of that, which is the distribution and the retail are well below their individual metrics. So in very good shape.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you talk about demand pull at the final couple of weeks for the quarter relative to what normally the demand looks like?
Timothy Leyden: They were very strong. I mean, and there were two things that drove that from an OEM viewpoint, there was when you looked at the information out of Taiwan for the ODMs they indicated that they had very strong March because the fact that the CPU, the lateness of the CPU delivery, enabled them or it required them to be able to catch up. And then we had the concern about the Japanese earthquake which drove very strong pulls from all channels in the last several weeks of the quarter.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Again not to push you, but I mean were we 20% higher than we typically are, 30% higher? I'm trying to just understand what "really strong" means.
John Coyne: Well, I think if you look at it, we believe that while February -- January tracked to the 155 guidance we gave in the last call for TAM. January tracked, February was weak. And we believe March, CPU delivery-driven demand would've delivered the quarter on track at 155. And we believe the incremental 5 million is response to the earthquake.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Eric Sterling: Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Eric Sterling for Ben Reitzes. I just had a quick question on your pricing expectations, for the remainder of the year.
Wolfgang Nickl: Again like we said, we're just providing color on the quarter that we've just started. We believe it is the price declines quarter-over-quarter are slightly below the historical norm. There are price declines because we had some pre-committed pricing in pre-3 '11 events and the swap markets have firmed up a bit as a function of supply demand, but it's way too early to tell what the pricing outlook would be for the remainder of the quarter. Our focus is on reducing our cost so that we continue to provide value to the marketplace.
Eric Sterling: Right. And just in terms of the pending acquisition, are the long-term gross margin targets I believe they were 19% to 24% are those still intact?
John Coyne: Yes.
Eric Sterling: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG: Thank you. You mentioned on the call that you think you'll be able to meet your commitments to the OEMs this quarter and now you're working on upside. So I'm curious, with other suppliers potentially having supply constraints this quarter, do you think you'll be able to gain share in the quarter? What is your expectation?
John Coyne: We'll see when the quarter is done. Our focus is on ensuring that we give the best support we possibly can to our customer needs.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then for the second half of the calendar year, do you plan to add capacity to support additional volumes in the second half?
John Coyne: As Wolfgang indicated, in response to a CapEx question, typically, we track the market very closely and we do just-in-time investment into capacity. And to Tim's point, we think there's going to be a component supply constraint throughout the industry through the September quarter. We then see an uptick in December from a demand perspective. We will plan to support that, but not over support it.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, so based on -- I know you guys have a history of bringing on capacity just-in-time. Should I assume that you're not currently adding any capacity right now?
John Coyne: I think that's encompassed by the capital guidance we've given for the full year.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Joe Yoo with Citi Investment Research.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. My first question is on the Samsung, Seagate deal. Obviously it's looked upon as being positive for the over-all industry, from a pricing perspective, but one of the concerns coming out of this is that TDK's incentive to be in the drive business could wane over time if Toshiba does not execute. How big of a concern is this to your company given that they are a critical component supplier?
John Coyne: We think that the -- our primary focus of course is on our acquisition of HGST, which we believe provides value to our customers and shareholders through our ability to enhance our technology, product portfolio and scale. We did indicate in our go forward strategy that our external, critical technology suppliers would continue to be a substantial and very important part of our go forward strategy. We've not worked our way through all of the implications of the Seagate, Samsung deal as it may relate to Seagate's choices post-combination as to their external sourcing strategy. And if that were to change substantially what that impact might be on TDK. But our focus is on working with our critical technology suppliers to ensure that they have viable, underpinned, go forward strategies for technology, quality and availability and competitiveness. And we're certainly very focused on working with those suppliers to ensure that, that continues.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. The second question is on the gross margins towards the back half of this year. It doesn't seem like the new products will have a meaningful impact to margins in 2012. And obviously it seems to be that you'll have some supply issues as well. Based on these challenges, is it unreasonable to expect gross margins to get back to at least the midpoint of your normal target range?
Wolfgang Nickl: Too early to tell. The model is 18% to 23% and typically in the latter half of the year you're in the upper end of this but it's really too early to tell.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc: And then my last question is on the PC food chain overall. You've put out there concerns about certain components for PCs potentially being a bottleneck. I mean how big of a concern is that relative to the ability of HDD suppliers to provide the drives in the second half?
John Coyne: Well, I think there's still some discovery in that area. I mean, it's a relatively multi-tiered supply chain with not only the components we normally think about like finished semiconductors, but all of the subcomponents and materials that go into that. We do know that there are some concerns in the semiconductor world about silicon wafers, about semiconductor packaging materials in the printed circuit board world about some of the chemicals and metals that go into making circuit boards. So there's -- then there's an issue of the continuing rolling blackouts in Japan, I mean there are a whole series of uncertainties. We're not fully convinced that they're fully understood yet. And you just need one thing that cannot be sourced that is essential to system build to alter the landscape. So I think there's going to be some uncertainty throughout the balance of this quarter because remember, most people are currently operating on parts in pipeline that were already in place prior to the earthquake. And so, the real true impact, I think, will begin to be much better framed as we get towards the end of May.
Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc: Great, thank you.
Operator: Kaushik Roy with Wedbush.
Kaushik Roy - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Did you notice that distributers and OEMs started allocating more to your competitors specifically Seagate after the HGST announcement?
John Coyne: You were very faint, but I think the question is had we noticed any reallocation of business away from WD and the post acquisition announcement phase?
Kaushik Roy - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Correct.
John Coyne: We have not. It's hard to tell whether that's driven by availability or whether we're continuing to do as good a job for customers as we've been doing up until now. That's certainly our objective.  So I think that's all the questions we've time for. Operator, I'd just like, in closing, to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in the company and in the industry. And we look forward to seeing you again in another quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time. Have a great day.

John Coyne: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD. Ever increasing demand for cost effective and high capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation over an extended term when addressed with an effective business model. With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low cost and high asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable throughout the last decade. Over the last five years, WD has profitably grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period, we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum. For fiscal year 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion. We increased operating income by 194% year-on-year. The hard drive demand growth story continues to be driven by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage either locally or in the cloud of massive amounts of digital content on low cost high capacity hard drives. We believe that the industry's growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its well-honed business model and expanding product set to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis. This growth opportunity has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost per gigabyte leading to attractive price points but have driven mass market adoption of devices incorporating hard drives. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs. Our assessment in late April of a June quarter time in the range of 157 million to 162 million proved overly optimistic. Actual demand for hard drives in the quarter was about 156 million units, down 4% sequentially but up 16% from the year ago period. The major factors leading to the lower time were weakness in Europe, destocking by OEM customers and a shift in OEM ordering patterns to take advantage of lower cost sea versus air freight. In hindsight, this expanded the March quarter at the expense of the June quarter. Given the change in the demand during the June quarter, WD and others in the industry responded quickly to adjusted bill times, resulting in quarter ending inventory modestly increased but at manageable levels. Chip inventory increased from seven to 10 days, while component distribution inventories increased slightly but remained at the midpoint of the normal four to six-week range including in transit. Taking these market dynamics into account, we were pleased to deliver one of the strongest fiscal fourth quarter performances in company history. While market dynamics in the June quarter will tamper short-term growth rates and affect price levels in the September quarter, we believe that the second half of the calendar year and calendar year 2011 will continue to present substantial growth opportunities and rewards for hard drive industry participants with effective business models and compelling product offerings. WD continues to generate substantial free cash flow while continuing to reinvest significantly in our business, both in expanding and enhancing our product offerings and in improving our operations. Over the course of fiscal 2010, we continue to lead the industry's fastest-growing segment, 2.5-inch drives, deploying industry-leading aerial density products at the 640 gigabyte, 750 gigabytes and 1 terabyte capacity points. We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS hard drives for server applications, part of our multi-year commitment to serve this important and heretofore, unserved market for WD. We brought to market our first client-oriented solid-state drive to complement our existing portfolio of high reliability embedded SSDs and we are in development of our first solid-state drive for high-end enterprise applications. In our Branded Products business, we broadened our portfolio of WD storage devices with the introduction of My Book Studio RX, hard drives for Apple users and the My Book AV DVR Expander hard drives, which allow users to keep more of their favorite movies and TV shows. We extended our family of WD Media Players with the WD TV Live Plus featuring added services such as Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, Pandora, Live 365 as well as Media Flight that enable consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It is also the first network Media Player compatible with Windows 7. On the manufacturing side, we improved the security of supply of glass substrates, and enhanced our long-term cost structure with the acquisition of Hoya's media operations. Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to acknowledge our loyal customers, who are the primary reason for WD's continued significant growth as a leading supplier of storage devices. We will continue to work passionately and diligently to earn their ongoing business. I also want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for their exceptional contribution to WD's revenue, profitability and cash generation in the fiscal year just ended. Tim?
Timothy Leyden: Thank you, John. In the June quarter, demand was weaker and more back-end loaded than we had anticipated. We believe that the weaker and less linear demand resulted from a number of things. OEM restocking during Q3 reduced market size in Q4. In European credit crisis led to some purchasing pause by retailers for a number of weeks due to the euro-exchange fluctuation, and there was relative weakness in the consumer space. The combination of these factors and the pressure exerted by some competitors increasing their production in a smaller market contributed to more downward pressure on selling prices than we had expected. Given these conditions, we acted to optimize our financial results, but at the same time, defending our market position. We are pleased that despite these challenging fiscal Q4 conditions, we achieved growth margins of 22.5% for the quarter, a 15-year high for WD in the fiscal Q4, and at the high-end of our long-term gross margin model range. For our full fiscal year 2010, total revenue was $9.8 billion. Hard drive shipments were 194 million units and ASP was $50. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $154 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal 2009 were total revenue of $7.5 billion, shipments of 146 million units and ASP of $51. Revenue from non-hard drive sales totaled approximately $62 million. Compared with 2009, gross margin in fiscal 2010 was 24.4% versus 17.9%. Operating income was $1.525 billion versus $519 million. Net income was $1.382 billion versus $417 million, and earnings per share was $5.93 versus $2.08. Net income in fiscal 2010 included $27 million of expense related to litigation settlement. Net income in fiscal 2009 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of Silicon Systems, $112 million of restructuring charges offset by related tax benefits of $4 million, and an $18 million gain on the sale of the company's substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia. Turning to the 2010 fourth quarter results. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 24% from the prior year, but down 10% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 49.7 million units, up 24% from the prior year period but down 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV and Media Players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $27 million, up 20% from the prior year and down 41% versus the March quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $1 from the year-ago quarter and down $4 from the March quarter. We shipped 19.9 million mobile drives in the June quarter, compared to 16.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 19.8 million in the March quarter, reflecting unit consumer demand in the U.S. and India, offset by commercial and emerging market growth. During the June quarter, we shipped 5.3 million drives into the DVR market, compared to 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter and 4.6 million in the March quarter. The strength in this market in the June quarter was in line with historical-seasonal patterns. Revenue from sales of our Branded Products including WD TV was $400 million, up 26% from $318 million in the year-ago quarter, and down 14% sequentially from $467 million in the March quarter reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. In addition to normal seasonality, the decline in the value of the euro impacted selling in Europe for a number of weeks. Enterprise SATA demand continues to grow in fiscal Q4, particularly at the high-capacity points. Our product lineup has us well-positioned in this segment. Our SAS products are making progress towards our multi-year plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market. Moving on to our sales channels and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution and 17% Branded Products in the June quarter, knowing the same percentage split as in the year-ago quarter and 49%, 33% and 18% in the March quarter. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue. Relative to the geographic split and on our revenue, the Asian market continued to be strong by 54% of revenue in the June quarter as compared to 54% in the year-ago quarter and 52% in the March quarter. The Americas and European regions contributed 25% and 21%, respectively, in the June quarter compared to 24% and 22% in the year-ago quarter and 24% in the March quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 19.2% in the year-ago quarter and down from 25.2% in the March quarter. Gross margin was impacted on a sequential basis by pricing, channel mix, segment mix and volume reductions. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $242 million or 10.2% of revenue. This includes the $27 million of litigation settlements and compares with $184 million or 9.5% revenue in the year-ago quarter and $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the March quarter. Operating income was $293 million or 12.3% of revenue. This compares with $209 million or 10.8% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the March quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were approximately $1 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 9.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled to $265 million or $1.13 per share. This compares with $196 million or $0.86 per share, and $400 million or $1.71 per share in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010, including $362 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycles for the fourth quarter was a positive of two days. This consisted of 48 days of receivables outstanding, 28 days of inventory or 13 turns and 74 days of payables. Our inventory turns were reduced by approximately one turn as the result of including the higher inventory that we acquired on June 30th. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for the June quarter were $185 million. Our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $134 million. Capital additions for fiscal 2010 totaled $737 million lower than our April projection of $750 million as we scale back in line with lower demand. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '10 totaled $510 million. During the fourth quarter, we acquired the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation for $233 million in cash. We expect that the Hoya will be mildly accretive to WD's long-term growth margin model by the end of the calendar year. But prior to that, it will have about a 50 basis points negative impact on the gross margin as we get it tuned to WD's production standards. We made $82 million of debt repayment installments during fiscal 2010, including $25 million during our fourth quarter. We reduced our debt balance to $400 million at the end of fiscal 2010. We exited fiscal Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, a decrease of $92 million from the March quarter. We continue to hold the cash balance in excess of our anticipated operating needs. With the strategy to maintain operational flexibility, increase our investments in advanced technology, expand our product breathe through the pursuit of internal and external opportunities, and to protect against macroeconomic weakness. The balance remaining in our stock repurchase authorization is $466 million. Now, I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2011. We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 78% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired Hoya production facility. We expect total CapEx in Q1 to come in around $275 million. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $650 million for the fiscal year. We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 6% and 9% and our cash tax rate to be between 1% and 2%. Now, we'll move on to our long-term business model. We believe annual growth in the unit shipments of the hard drive market will continue in the 10% to 15% range into the foreseeable future. It should generate industry-revenue growth of between 5% and 7.5%. Given this industry-growth rate, we expect to operate within our long-term growth margin model range of 18% to 23%, with some longer term off of momentum from an increasing percentage on local media as well as advancing our presence in the traditional enterprise market. Our OpEx model target has continued in the 9% to 10% range and our resulting operating income will range from 8% to 14%. Tax expense is estimated to be in the range of 6% to 9% income before taxes. These parameters would yield net income in the 7% to 12.5% range. Now, turning to our guidance for fiscal Q1. Historically, September-quarter demand has been up by 10 to 13% when compared to June volumes. However, a number of factors are leading us to forecast lower growth this quarter. We believe that some of July's natural OEM demands was fulfilled at the end of June, and that OEMs are less concerned about shortages than they were a few months ago. U.S. retails sales statistics also suggests that there has been some emerging consumer demand weakness. Additionally, we believe that OEMs have planned for a regular back-to-school season and that components to satisfy those demand expectations are either in their manufacturing pipelines or in transit at this point in time. As we entered the quarter, demand has started out slowly as some customers deplete on-hand customer inventory and await confirmation of the extent of back-to-school demand. These factors will dampen the typical season of uplift to an expected range of between 2% and 6%, which translates into a TAM range of between 160 to 165 million units. Taking these factors into account, we anticipate that pricing will be competitive and further dependent on emerging demand level dynamics as-back-to-school season gets underway. Should demand turn out to be stronger than anticipated, we expect to be able to respond to the upside. Accordingly, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.350 billion to $2.450 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $235 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 7.5%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million. We estimated earnings per share between $0.80 and $0.90 for the September quarter. Bob?
Bob Blair: Ready for questions, operator.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company, LLC: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, I guess first just a follow-up on your comments on pricing. Were they centered primarily around the consumer retail side of your business, which you look at it at least 20%? Or is it an OEM comment as well, right. So with that pricing that was set at the end June heading into this quarter and there really is little that can change it.
Timothy Leyden: Yes, I mean pricing, there was worst than what we would have expected in pretty much all segments of our business during the course of the quarter. Of course, it was really in the areas where in the segments were consumers are strongest, which is retail and the channel. And then as a result of that, it takes a little while longer, but OEM do think to reset their prices as a result of the prices that they are seeing coming out of those channels. So, we're expecting that for Q1 that in what would normally have been an expectation of either a flat to [inaudible] that price declines will be worsened than historically. And even though there will be a little bit of mix up because of the consumer demand, awaiting of consumer demand as we get headed to back-to-school season, we don't think that that will be sufficient to offset the pricing decline.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company, LLC: So, then in terms of your CapEx commentary even for this coming quarter, have you throttled that back as well or is there already stuff that's in process and you can't stop it. Or can you just talk about, or at least directionally expect your capacity utilization to be in light of that CapEx?
Timothy Leyden: Yes. But I mean we have CapEx on order and in the pipeline that is with this market site numbers, it is in excess of what we would waste. Consequently, we're going to have to work on it in order to push it out.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company, LLC: Okay. Then just lastly, despite even this type of guidance, you should be generating a significant amount of cash flow yet the stocks and the group as a whole trades at probably record-trough levels. What is the Board's view and the management view of exercising the risk of that buyback or even potentially going private?
Timothy Leyden: I'd have to ask the board about going private, but we are obviously evaluating what's the best way to use our cash at all times. We believe that we have an inclination towards utilizing cash operationally and strategically because we believe that that's the option that offers the best return to the shareholders in the long term.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company, LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And now to Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah –Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: Yes. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I guess just going back to pricing as you guys envision kind of September-quarter demand hopefully planning out and then if we can get some semblance of the typical seasonality as well from your perspective into December. I guess what does it take to get pricing declines back to where you think they should be, sort of normalized pricing declines and not necessarily stability, but where you guys think it should be as we move through the fall?
John Coyne: Well, I think, the requirements for stabilizing pricing and continuing to work on efficiency and cost and thereby expanding margin that typically is a cyclical process. Once demand exceeds the baseline build plans of the drive industry, we'll begin to see that dynamics kick in. What we – [inaudible] it's quite possible that as we see the actual back-to-school sell through happening, that we will see the normal, seasonal uptick in the late-August, early-September timeframe and I believe if we see a strong sell through and back-to-school, that will inject confidence into the planning and demand profiles of our customers as we head into the holiday season-demand period. So, it's quite possible that we'll see that in the very late FQ1 and through FQ2.
Ananda Baruah –Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: Thanks, that's helpful. And I guess just as we think about gross margin dynamics for the September quarter, you mentioned I think it was four things. I think price, and then channel mix, segment mix, and then number four is volume as impacting the June quarter gross margins. Is that the same order that we should think about them or I guess order of magnitude? How should we think about what's going to impact gross margins in this December quarter.
Timothy Leyden: Yes, I think it's pretty much in the same old or I would imagine because the segment mix would be a bit better because the consumer and retail and channel as back-to-school season comes. And so pricing channel segments and I don't think volumes because we are in an up market, we're going to defend our market share.
Ananda Baruah –Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: Okay, great. And then just one last one related for me, if I could. Is there anything on the cost side in terms of component cost take outs as we move to the September quarter that you guys can do kind of to catch up to some of the price declines that have taken place, like good service, a bit of a support to the gross margin?
Timothy Leyden: I think very consistently part of our business model is to consistently and continuously reduce cost through efficiency improvements and by design, and that process is alive and well and we're focused on continuing to accomplish that as we move forward. I think if you look at the long-term cadence of the industry, we've consistently expanded margins as we move through the last decade, and we've done that. Half of that has been driven by growth of our business and the other half has been driven by our vertical integration of our business and efficiency and cost efforts. And so we started out at the beginning of the decade '01, '02 averaged 12% gross margin; '03, '04 was 16; '05, '06 was 18; '07 and '08 was 19; '09 and '10 was 21. So, we've seen a continuous expansion in margins at the same time that we've seen north of 20% compound annual revenue growth throughout that period.
Ananda Baruah –Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC: All right, thanks.
Timothy Leyden: And we would expect to continue to exercise the same model on the same underlying market demand that as we move forward.
Operator: I got Craig [ph] with Merrill Lynch.
Craig – Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Guys, can you maybe talk a little bit around the long-term gross margin target and how Hoya is going to impact that? And then my second question would be from the European retailer perspective that they took a pause there, so to speak, did that come back toward the end of the quarter and then into the record so far ?
John Coyne: Okay, so the European situation, the pause, that has helped for a number of weeks was when they – currency was fluctuating mostly in a downward direction as far as they were concerned. So, consequently, they were unsure about what to do as they grappled towards having to buy goods that were denominated in dollars and had to operate on the market to the end-user at a fixed price point. So, they were concerned, they had uncertainty so they have hesitated to refill our pipeline. And when the currency fluctuations settle downed a bit, they did come back into the market and started refilling their pipeline, but at a muted [ph] level versus what would have been normal, otherwise. And the second question is the Hoya gross margins? As we've indicated it to be mildly accretive is the terms we used. And that is based upon the fact that we've fallen a little behind our model of it internal versus external and in getting back to our model, which the Hoya acquisition will help us to do, it will add something in the region of about 0.5% just going through [inaudible] to gross margins in the longer term.
Craig – Merrill Lynch: All right, thank you.
Operator: Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, I guess, the first question would be on the OpEx. I just want to be clear, $235 million, how much of that is reflective of the Hoya acquisition in the quarter when you benchmark that against it looks like 215 kind of million adjusted for that litigation expense last quarter.
John Coyne: Yes, there isn't really anything to speak out of Hoya expenditure in the OpEx.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, I guess that begs the question of why $235 million? Last quarter you guided $220 million and you came in at $250 million adjusted. So what's the sequential increase driven by?
John Coyne: Very little compensation accruals. So consequently, if you can imagine with the expectations that we had for the first half of the year, we didn't reach those expectations. And those in amount that went back in there and managed to bring the number down to $250 million. So at the level of expectations that we are now setting, we've put in that estimate for OpEx in order to cover that, and also, we continue to invest in R&D.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So I guess just looking at the other pieces of the P&L just to get to the number, it's a benchmark – it looks like you're somewhere around 19% gross margin, inclusive of the 50 basis point headwind from Hoya, is that correct?
John Coyne: Yes.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then final question would be for me is when you look at the TAM assumptions you guys are making, I think there's a lot of, I think, questions out there about the back-to-school build dynamics as it relates to more product shipping, ocean versus air. How much of your TAM assumptions have you adjusted for that dynamic, and is it you guys have good visibility into that trend?
John Coyne: Well, I think, the build has largely been taking place already or is in the very final stages of build with the majority already in transit. So the real thing that we're watching is the actual sell-through during back-to-school season. And I think the general input from our OEM base is pretty cautious right now. And they too are waiting to see what the consumer demand profile is going to look like through late July and August. So we're looking for that to tell us whether the rest of the quarter will be one of muted expectations for the future leading to consumption of on-hand component stock, or whether the view of the future by our customers will be more positive, which would lead them to immediately begin to replenish stocks of components.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And your visibility to that won't really happen, until what, late August?
Timothy Leyden: Mid to late August.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Kevin Hunt with Hapoalim Securities.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Actually I have a couple of questions. Just a follow-up on the Hoya question, when did you say that, that would be turned from a drag to a benefit?
Timothy Leyden: Beginning in the next calendar year. So it would be a drag until the end of this calendar year.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: And that was gradually build towards the east of the half-point that is –?
Timothy Leyden: Yes.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: And my second question is really just digging in more to this demand outlook The year outlook was lower than Seagate's, which was much lower than Intel's and Dell, and other people who have given an outlook recently. So I'm just trying to tie out – you're implying somewhere of the 15% annual year-year unit kind of increase versus those other kind of larger guys saying 20%. And they're all talking about better corporate builds offsetting this weaker back-to-school so – why I guess – why do you think it's something differently to you than they're saying outside the rest of them Wall Street? I guess that's the question number one.
John Coyne: Well, I think when you peel apart Intel's numbers and guidance, you'll see that the majority of their growth was in their server business in terms of the growth rates as they gave the detail on the segments, their growth for the PC-related market was 2%, and we believe the bulk of that was ASP growth rather than unit growth. And we think part of the forward positive guidance relates to the fact that as they did a product transition to Capella, there was no buildup of the inventory at the component level in the OEM customers. In fact there was a brief shortage as they transition from old to new. So I think there's a different stocking dynamic in Intel versus the drive industry. There is however, and we are seeing it, an uplift in commercial. But the combination of the macroeconomic conditions in Europe allied to the strong proportion of our business in distribution and retail and in OEM consumer is – the commercial boost is not making up completely in terms of overall growth rate for the softness we currently see in consumer and what we saw through last quarter was some flushing of inventory by the OEMs, and we are building in to our forward look for this quarter an expectation that they will release another little bit of on-hand component inventory. However, all of that being said – so we're planning on the conservative basis from a capacity-utilization perspective and a CapEx perceptive. However, as our history indicates, we're ever mindful of close attention to the actual numbers and the ability to sprint talk to address opportunity as they present themselves.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. I guess the other part of the same question you'd kind of alluded to about rising on both and so forth and that sort of the new dynamic. I mean is that going to let them change going forward the sort of seasonality that you see? And so would that also change the holiday build and pull that pour earlier into, say, the third quarter?
John Coyne: Well, it's not so much drives on boats as systems on boats. And I think there's a little bit of a standoff going on there. But the OEMs are waiting to see the back-to-school before they decide fully what to do for the holiday. And that may force some of the holiday to the air freighted. And that seems to be a preference for them to look at a more assured build plan for the holiday, based on knowledge of the back-to-school sell-troughs than shaving the little bit of incremental margin and pre-committing themselves by building a product early and putting them on boats.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Keith Bachman, Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: Hi. Thanks very much. I have two questions as well. What do you think the industry capacity is for both the September and the December quarters as you look at the TAM, particularly that you just mentioned 160 to 165, how do you think that matches up against the capacity that will be in place during the course of this quarter and next?
John Coyne: I think the capacity is a little ahead of that number. The real issue is what each company decides to do relative to utilization of capacity.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: Okay. Which one player in particular, I guess? The second question and is – I just want to see if I can get your take on the status of the collective and broader inventory. You've talked about some of the different piece parts, but if you try to characterize not only what's in the channel but also what will end up on the balance sheet of the vendors and even guesses on OEMs. I'm just trying to understand what the balance is of inventory today. Seagate referred to a specific number when they talked about 5 million incremental drives, but I want to get your take on the balance of the inventory.
John Coyne: Yes. We think there's about 2.5 weeks of total inventory between drives that belong to the drive makers, that's the OEM jilt [ph] and the finished goods inventory that's in the drive makers, and – plus, the inventory that's in the distribution and retail channels at the drive level. So we when you add all of that together about 2.5 weeks, which is an increase of about 10% over the position ending start last quarter – ending the March quarter.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: John, sorry. What do you think inventory is the disti [ph]?
John Coyne: Disti [ph] is about five weeks for us and for the industry. When you include both the inventory on hand at the distributors, components inventory on hand at the distributors and in transit that they already own.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal: Great. Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thank you. You made a comment that you thought that the OEMs did some re-stocking in the March quarter, and I was curious how much re-stocking do you we think we saw in the March quarter? If you have an estimate?
John Coyne: The best point that we have is to mismatch the loose there between the movement in market size from December to March, where drivers were off then at 2% but PCs were down 7%.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then in terms of the litigation settlement, can you provide us a little more detail on what that litigation settlement was about? And then also I'm making the assumption that, that settlement was in the SG&A line, and is that correct?
John Coyne: That's correct. Substantially, all of the expense for litigation related to the nightsel [ph] lawsuit described in our previous SEC filings. We do not or did not admit any liability. However, we settled in order to avoid the expense and distraction and uncertainty of ongoing litigation.
Operator: Steve Fox with CLSA.
Steve Fox – CLSA Limited: Hi. Good afternoon. First of all, just another question on Hoya. When you look at the net benefit once you've, I guess, improved efficiencies. Can you talk about the accretion a little bit more and at least maybe provide a guidepost on internal costing versus external purchases of those splatters?
John Coyne: Well, I mean, that's about as much a bit that half percent is about as much as we're going to say. But it has an important benefit to us, and that its secures supply for us. And of course, it gets us back to our model on internal versus external. Those are two critical things for us.
Steve Fox – CLSA Limited: And then just from a competitive behavior standpoint, if the unit demand place up, like you just discussed, why is it that we should have some confidence that whenever large players won't continue to be aggressive on prices, is there any signs that would be positive that they may have started to be more responsible with pricing?
John Coyne: Well, you have to put yourself in position of the players in the market. This is not an old boy's club. It's a competitive commodity market place, and we didn't grow revenue by 22% annually for the last five years and by 20% annually over the last 10 years by sitting back and relaxing. We did it by providing exceptional value to our customers in quality, reliability, desirable products, availability of product and price. And then on the other side of that we expanded our gross margins throughout that process, where we went from 10% market share to over 30% market share. At the same time that we expanded our margins from 12% to 21%. So I think what we're seeing is that the third large player who has significantly improved internal execution and capability over the course of the last few years, and is now in a position to seek to grow just as we have been and are. And so the real issue is, have you got the right products, are you able to make them at the right cost to profitably grow your business on an ongoing basis in a market that offers a 15% annualized growth in demand? And if you can answer yes to all of those boxes, you got a great business, which grows consistently on revenue and profit, and returns great value to the shareholders of those businesses.
Steve Fox – CLSA Limited: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the perspective.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan Chase & Co: Yes, thank you. May be I can follow on that last topic. I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of the third major participant that executing better – do you think there was any sort of misread on their part, where may be they don't have all the reporting mechanisms in place as Seagate and WD have in terms of trying to early stop the very fluid ebb and flow of both the channel as well as the OEM markets, or is it more of just – did these guys made a concerted kind of stone as that what I recall. Second quarter in a row now where they're quarterly growth is outside between you and SeaGate.
John Coyne: We'll have to wait and see till they report as to exactly what they've done from unit's revenue, profitability perspective. There is of course, you have to recognize the models. And whenever quarter-over-quarter demand is lower, that all those favors the small player in that environment in terms of their growth because if you have, let's say, pick a number, if you have 10% share at a major OEM and your two major competitors have 45% each and the market goes down. As the small player, you can afford to bid aggressively to get an increasing share and either keep your volume constant or grow it, and get the benefit of that growth on your bottom line. For the very large participant at any given customer to lean into that wind and price to grow volume, it's usually too costly to do that. So there's a natural tendency for the small players to grow when the market goes down, and then the ability of the large players to scale up rapidly causes them to typically grow when the market demand moves up.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan Chase & Co: John, maybe as a follow-up to that discussion point, can you give us any more color, I know Keith tried to ask it earlier, I guess we're all just trying to understand. As disturbed participants being used as a lever by the OEMs that they really extract some pricing discounts. Are you seeing them start to have a lot more phone [ph] in the glass China where section here where HP and Dell and others now recognized disturbed participant as may be a legitimate source in both desktop and notebook more something of historically?
John Coyne: Yes, we do a lot of procurement and we prefer multi-sourced model.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan Chase & Co: So this could be of information that could be more comp rather than acute – ?
John Coyne: Yes, but throw your mind back. It's been this way for the last 10 years. The OEMs have sought multiple suppliers, and those people who had a good business model don't just look at WD's performance in an environment that was much more competitive than it is today. There were a lot more players and a lot more choices for the customers. And so over the years, we've not only survived but thrived in that environment, and I see every reason to expect to continue to do the same as we go forward.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Just last question if I could. As far as the debate over Ocean versus Airfreight, it seems based on my analysis that over the last 18 months we've seen a pretty big shift already to Ocean versus Air across the PCs. Is this a customer acknowledgment that maybe the company down through Round Rock has been [inaudible] in their the Ocean Freight in the last call at quarter two to catch up with their peers? Is this causing some of the disturbance in your model?
John Coyne: I mean it's been a rolling phenomenon across the major PC companies that as more and more competition has emerged from Asia, where the business models tend to require a smaller net margin, that has certainly caused all the traditional players to dig deeper looking for a lower cost, and Sea Freight is one element of that lower cost. But it does create a little bit less visibility into real demand because it extends the time between the decision to build and the actual sale.
Operator: Kay Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kay Huberty – Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. John, it sounds like a big swing factor in the second half will be the demand going back to school and therefore, the behavior around holiday builds. What are the other one or two big swing factors you see that could impact results either positively or negatively?
John Coyne: Well, I mean the biggest one that we're looking at is macroeconomics. And whether the European recipe for recovery works and whether the U.S. stays on track, that's kind of the biggest dark cloud that we're continually looking at. And then the sunshine that's lurking behind that is the commercial refresh and the rate at which that progresses. And I guess there's a moon there as well which is the strength in Asia, which is significant.
Kay Huberty – Morgan Stanley: And on the commercial point, are you seeing any air freighting commercial demand where you could potentially see those builds get pulled forward into September or is the – sorry, the ocean freighting, just consumer or is it also commercial?
Timothy Leyden: There's some commercial on boats, too. But commercial has a large component of desktop in it and typically they are regionally assembled and the drives are air freighted into those locations.
Kay Huberty – Morgan Stanley: And then lastly, do you shares SeaGate's view that you won't be able to reset ASPs as an industry until the next day product cycle that comes in 12 months?
John Coyne: No.
Kay Huberty – Morgan Stanley: And what would be – ?
John Coyne: And we're just – I mean, we're – our model is not solely driven by product refresh. Our model is driven by continuous provision of the demand that capacity points at the best mix of technologies that support continuous and ongoing cost reduction. So we're going to have to wrap it up now. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you and meeting with you in the months ahead. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today’s call will be available on the investor section of Western Digital’s website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I’d like to now turn the call over President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.
John Coyne: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. For the third consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was at the high end of expectations as the positive industry conditions that first materialized in the June quarter continued throughout the second half of the calendar year. The demand strength continues to be primarily consumer driven though we are now also seeing some signs of recovery in the commercial sector. We believe that overall hard drive shipments in the December quarter totaled 160 million units, up 29% on the year ago quarter and 5% sequentially. Industry inventory, OEM and distribution combined remains extremely lean at approximately two weeks of sales reflecting the strong demand in the quarter, constraints in the industry supply chain particularly in media and sub strait, and continued industry discipline in managing the supply demand dynamic in those segments where supply constraints are not dominant. We are very pleased with WD’s continued progress in pursuit of our primary objective of sustained profitable growth as we continue to respond to strength in customer demand. For the third consecutive quarter we significantly increased output in a supply constrained environment providing strong support of our customer’s growth opportunities. Strength in overall market demand, continued customer preference for WD products, our timely investments in capital, the support of our supply partners and strong execution by the WD team generated record revenue and profits on record unit shipments. A moderate pricing environment combined with our passionate focus on cost and efficiency enabled gross margins well above the high end of our model range. We contained operating expenses under the low end of our model, yet we continued to grow our R&D investments by 8% sequentially. Asset management remained crisp resulting in record cash generation. I’m particularly pleased that our management through the difficulties of the recession and our subsequent response to improving market conditions since April have increased our calendar year 2009 revenues and net income by 4% and 34% respectively, compared with calendar year 2008. Our compound annual growth rate over the last three calendar years which included the dampening effect of the recession was 19% for revenue, 25% for units and 29% for net income. We continue to realize tangible benefit from the substantial investments we’ve made in technology, products, processes and capacity over the last few years with several notable product achievements in the last quarter. Most significant, as part of our sustained portfolio diversification and expansion strategy is our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the shipment of our 2.5 inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November.  This new product family complements a range of enterprise SAS drives which we have been shipping for some years now and will allow us to both expand our business with many existing customers and add new customers in the enterprise storage arena. In the December quarter driven by strong customer adoption of our newest products, we led the industry in volume shipments of the market’s largest capacity points in the industry’s fastest growing segment; one terabyte, 750 gigabyte and 640 gigabyte 2.5 inch drives in the branded products and notebooks markets and two terabyte 3.5 inch drives in the branded and enterprise SATA sectors. In the branded product area, we continue to innovate. Our new WD Smartware which is now available across our refreshed My Passport and My Book external storage product lines has received very positive reviews for its highly intuitive, easy to use visual representation of the back up and synchronization process providing a highly differentiated and superior user experience. Further developing the theme of convenience and ease of use, we also introduce E-label display features on our premium external storage product lines. In media players, we expanded our popular WD TV range with the successful of our WD TV live product which adds network connectivity enabling home content aggregation as well as direct access to stream external content. Additionally this month we launched the industries first certified USB 3.0 external drive with the My Book 3.0, an industry leading, high performance solution for power users. Entering calendar 2010 we are very excited about the immediate and the long term growth opportunities for WD in both the consumer and commercial storage segments. Over the last nine months, despite the backdrop of a world wide recession, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high capacity, cost effective storage. We believe this demand is driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in every day life and spurred in the consumer segment by increasing versatile and powerful devices and PC’s with new attractive price points. In support of this thesis, yesterday’s New York Times cited a recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation that determined the average young American now spends practically every waking minute except for time at school using a smart phone, computer, television or other electronic device, amount to more than 7.5 hours a day.  This compares with less than 6.5 hours a year ago, and this does not count the hour and half that youth spend texting or the half hour they talk on their phones. And because so many of them are multi-tasking, the pack an average of nearly 11 hours of media content into that 7.5 hours. Meanwhile, in the commercial sector, the prospects for a recovery and corporate IT spending, the demand for green IT infrastructure solutions and a PC refresh cycle provide more optimistic indicators than a year ago at this time. We are addressing what we believe is a secular shift to increase usage of mass volume storage in all walks of life. To do so, we are focusing on enhancing the advantaged business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customer’s needs and earning their business in the fastest growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability underpinned by our low cost model, our vertical integration, the industry’s fastest asset turns and strongest balance sheet. We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as we move into new markets for WD such as the traditional enterprise. However, our enthusiasm is tempered by current macro economic uncertainties and we continually monitor the actual demand data and remain on guard against excessive optimism about the 2010 outlook. We are maintaining our flexibility and agility and are willing to apply the brakes if conditions warrant. Before I pass the call to Tim Leydon, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the opportunities that emerged throughout the quarter, and our customers for providing those opportunities. Once again, we have further strengthened WD and our long term mission of generating sustained, profitable growth.
Timothy Leydon: Revenue for our second fiscal quarter was $26 million up 44% from the prior year and 19% sequentially. Hard drive shipments total 49.5 million units, up 39% from the prior year period and 12% sequentially. Non hard drive revenue including sales of WD TV, HD media sales and solid state drives totaled approximately $47 million compared to $12 million in the prior year and $36 million in the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $52.00 per unit, up $1.00 from the year ago quarter and up $3.00 from the September quarter. Industry demand was strong, coming in at the high end of our anticipated range of 152 to 160 million units. Within that environment, demand for WD’s products was stronger than expected. We satisfied a disproportionate share of the overall market growth which is a validation of the benefits of having a large scale vertically integrated and agile business model. Our low cost focus combined with a favorable product and segment mix, moderate price declines, enabled us to service that demand at margins that exceeded our business model parameters. Desk top demand was stronger than expected due in part to the re-emerging commercial market and growth in China. The market size was constrained by supply and pricing remained stable. We see unfulfilled demand rolling over into the third quarter. We shipped 21.2 million mobile drives in the December quarter compared to 13.8 million in the year ago quarter and 19.2 million in the September quarter. This above market growth was driven primarily by ability to meet customer appetite for high capacity drives at 640 gigabytes and above. During the December quarter, we shipped 4.1 million drives into the DVR market, flat with the year ago quarter and up from 3.1 million in the September quarter. This improvement in sequential quarterly volume was driven by improved market demand and adoption of our WD Greenpower drive platform. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV was $569 million up 41% from $4403 million in the year ago quarter and 49% sequentially from $382 million in the September quarter. The increase in branded revenue is partly due to increasing demand for external storage, the refresh of our branded product line and continued consumer preference for WD products in this space. On the enterprise front, demand for near line storage once again exceeded expectations and our SATA product portfolio was well positioned to avail of this market expansion particularly at the high capacity points. The traditional enterprise market continues to recover. In the space, we are pleased with the acceptance of our new SAS products. Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results; revenue by channel was 48% OEM, 30% distribution and 22% branded products in the December quarter compared with 57%, 21% and 22% in the year ago quarter and 52%, 31`,% and 17% in the September quarter respectively. The geographic space of our revenue was 25% America’s, 25% Europe and 50% Asia as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the year ago quarter and 22%, 22% and 56% in the September quarter. The increases in the percentages for America’s and Europe from the September quarter reflects strength in branded products and in component distribution. There was one customer, HP that comprised more that 10% of our total revenue. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 26.2% up from 15.9% in the year ago quarter and 23.3% in the September quarter. As mentioned earlier, our low cost focus, our favorable product and segment mix and moderate price declines contributed to gross margin favorability. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $214 million or 8.2% of revenue. This compares with $161 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Our spending reflects our confidence in the strong future opportunities for storage in an environment of expanding digital content. Operating income was $473 million or 85.1% of revenue. This compares with $16 million or 1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the September quarter. Interest and other non operating expenses were approximately $2 million. Tax expense for the December quarter was $42 million or 8.9% of pre tax income, and that’s within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year. Our net income totaled $429 million or $1.85 per share. This compares with $14 million or $0.06 per share and $288 million or $1.25 per share in the year ago and September quarters respectively. Turning to the balance sheet, for the December quarter our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding, 21 days of inventory or 17 turn and 71 days of payables. We generated $557 million in cash flow from operation. Capital expenditures were $199 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $126 million. We also make our third quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million thus reducing our debt balance to $444 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $379 million ending at $2.435 billion. The 49.5 million hard drives we shipped in the December quarter represent a new record for the company. We believe that 2010 will be a strong year for the proliferation of digital storage and continued customer preference for WD product. Consequently, we’re increasing our capital expenditures forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 million and $750 million compared with our previous projection of $650 million.  Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is now expected to be about $550 million as compared to our previous estimate of $540 million. We are ever mindful of the potential for a dip in demand that may be caused by economic circumstances beyond our control and we remain focused on supply/demand equilibrium and poised to use our flexible and agile business model to respond quickly to demand changes. Over the medium term, we continue to have strong growth potential in the existing markets we serve and currently unaddressed markets, given our market position and broad portfolio, willingness to invest in R&D and production assets and our strong balance sheet. Nevertheless we are actively seeking to augment this strength by selective investments in product line expansion both internally and externally.  We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we evaluate the merits of further repurchases against internal and external investment alternatives. Now I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2010. First let me outline the market situation as we see it. We believe that continued demand for storage of digital content will drive positive growth for the storage industry as a whole despite the global macro economic conditions continuing to be challenging. In this robust storage demand environment, we believe that WD is well positioned within the industry to benefit from this growing market because of our agility, flexibility, product line up, technology and financial resources. Historically March quarter demand has been down sequentially in a range from 5% to 7%. However that true demand in the December quarter was not entirely satisfied and this coupled with an expectation of continuing strong demand for digital storage leads us to margin the market size of between 152 to 158 million units, a sequential decline of 1% to 5%. We anticipate that pricing will be flat to down but will be rational based on supply demand balance in all markets. Consequently, we expect revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $220 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $2 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 235 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $1.45 and $1.55 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arun Sharma – UBS.
Arun Sharma – UBS: I was wondering if you could talk about the degree of corporate PC refresh and the level of Windows 7 benefits you’re embedding into your outlook and has there been any change in your views in these two areas for the past few months?
John Coyne: I think we’ve seen a modest awakening in the commercial sector and we continue to map that to be relatively modest in the current quarter and probably through mid year with a continuing uptick as we head into the back half of the year.
Arun Sharma – UBS: Given your outperformance on the margin side in the last two quarters are you reevaluating? How are you looking at your 18% to 23% target going forward? Are you still comfortable with that range or should we see it as fairly conservative over the next year or so and what are the puts and takes in terms of margin expansion going forward?
Timothy Leydon: It’s at 23% margin model range and it is, we’re comfortable with it the current product and segment mix. We have indicated that as we gain more traction in the traditional enterprise market that we would get to a 10% market share. It would add about 7.5% or so to the margin model. But it’s our long term margin model. We’re comfortable with it at the moment, but there is opportunity for us to be able to expand that and we are forecasting for Q3 that we will be above the top of the margin model range. So it is possible given behavior of competitors, the supply demand balance, the industry conditions and the segment mix to actually to above the upper end of that model range.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Kugele – Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: First on the head procurement, obviously there’s the external supply chain for heads has dwindled. You do a fair amount of internally, but of all the components that one seems to be the one where the vendors seem most unwilling to expand capacity. Are you comfortable with the external supply of heads in particular or have you compensated for that in this new CapEx numbers so that you can do more yourself?
John Coyne: Consistently since we acquired the internal head capability we have maintained a consistent model of roughly 80 internal 20 external and that continues to be our model. We’re working closely with our external partner to share our views not only of overall market opportunity but specifically Western Digital opportunity within the market and I believe we are very well aligned together in pursuing the model that we’ve consistently pursued over the last number of years since we acquired head capability and we see that continuing into the future with very solid support from our external partner.
Richard Kugele – Needham & Company: In terms of the unmet demand in the December quarter, is there a way of at least ball parking just how much demand may have been left on the table? And then in that vein, the inventory numbers you talked about are extremely lean and I can’t recall actually seeing that type of a number before. Do you foresee an ability to go and get to even contractual levels for hubs and such or are the OEM’s okay as long as you continue to replenish as quickly as they need it?
John Coyne: I think you’re correct that inventory levels have been extremely lean since April, since the recovery in demand surprised all of us and has continued to move along at a good clip. If you look at our estimates for demand, the 152 to 158 number that Tim just gave, that is reflecting some spillover of unfulfilled demand from the December quarter. If you look at total industry demonstrated capability last quarter, and I certainly don’t think anybody was holding back product, then potentially we could rebuild a couple of million units into inventory through the quarter running full out which wouldn’t move the needle very much off of a very lean inventory environment. So I expect if there’s any real inventory replenishment to get things into a more traditional sustainable model, that will occur in the June quarter and that will be required to occur in the June quarter in order to support what we expect a very robust back half of the year. And again, I believe industry supply chain investments are lagging opportunity and will constrain total availability through the entire calendar year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox – Calyon Securities (USA).
Steven Fox – Calyon Securities (USA): First of all on pricing, can you be just a little more specific? You said pricing flat to down. Were you talking about like to like or mix adjusted and is there any differences by product segments we could be aware of? And then when you look at the retail market, the rebound in external drives, how much of that would you tie into bundling of externals with PC’s and how much was that just sales of externals on their own?
Timothy Leydon: On the flat to down pricing, it’s the average pricing I’m referring to. We don’t give out like to like pricing. The reason that we’re modeling that is because the demand is down. We’re anticipating that demand be down from 160 to 158 or at least that’s the high end of the range we’re modeling. There is also, we have strength, we have the strongest competitive position in 2.5 inch and as you know in the September and December quarters, some of our competitors turned their attention towards small form factor and gaming and in the March quarter they’ve come back into the market and address the more mainstream product. So consequently with that as a backdrop, that’s why we’re modeling it to be down.
John Coyne: Relative to strength in the external storage market, the branded product market, the vast majority of that is for independently purchase external attach as distinct from bundling with initial sales of PC’s.
Steven Fox – Calyon Securities (USA): Is there any other color around what drove the acceleration besides obviously better economic trending? Anything else that you would add whether it’s retail promotion? I don’t know what else.
John Coyne: The underlying them there I believe is the increasing proliferation of devices which only have capacity for transient storage and so those devices are interacting with tons of storage of content that people want to capture and store for extended periods. They’re generating content.  If you look at the number of devices today that have high resolution cameras and high resolution video capability so the amount of content being generated by the small devices with small capacity, solid state storage on board is generating huge demand for transfer to max storage capability that the best of which is the externally attached hard drive. So we think that’s the fundamental underlying driver. Relative to WD’s success in this area, I think we’ve talked before and we’re continuing to focus on the ease of use, the style, the convenience of product and delivering leading capacity points to the market and I think all of these things combined with our consistent interaction with our channel partners and consistent positioning of our product line makes that a very attractive line for our partners and results in a very high level of access for consumers for the WD brand.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Cihra – Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra – Caris & Company: I wanted to ask a couple of product questions. First within notebook you made mention of the 320 gig per platter. So on a 320 gig per platter just wondering where you are in terms of that ramp. Are qualifications done? Are you shipping volume and with the type of things that’s actually meaningful as a percentage of units relative to the 250. And similarly, I’m wondering is you’re willing to give us any view on the SAS product, what kind of units. Are they meaningful units yet? How is that going? What kind of acceptance, that sort of thing.
John Coyne: Certainly our shipments of 640 gig capacity point into both the notebook marketplace and our through our branded products channel were significant and meaningful and we’re by far the largest shipper of that technology and capacity point into the market. In relation to our SAS entry, it was planned to be modest. It is modestly ahead both in volume and mix of what we expected and has been well received but we’re not breaking out units at this time.
Robert Cihra – Caris & Company: And when do you think you would break out units? 
John Coyne: When it become meaningful to the overall business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank: I wanted to get a sense of your view of the first quarter. Your guidance for the industry is a little bit more conservative than Seagate’s guidance that they gave last night. They said units would be about flat to down at about 3% in the quarter so I wanted to get a sense of why you’re a bit more conservative than Seagate. And then as a follow up, in terms of the capital expansion that you’re planning for this year, what kind of assumptions have you made about unit growth for 2010 and would you be comfortable with the numbers that Seagate gave last night of units growing about 17% to 20% in 2010?
John Coyne: Conservatism, I’m not sure. I think we’re really looking at what we see and interpreting the market. I can’t speak for Seagate. We did our own analysis and came up with those numbers and those are the numbers we’re comfortable with. In terms of the total growth for the market for calendar 2010, we don’t have any significant difference between ourselves and Seagate for those totals. Our different view of the current quarter is within 1.5%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan: The first question is kind of loaded so I do apologize but I assume that you’re pretty darn close to 100% capacity utilization and I know sometimes when you go above 95% when you’re running full tilt there can be some inefficiencies. I just want to get a sense, if we don’t really see any pull back in this gradual recovery that appears to be in earnest here right now, as you bring on the extra capacity, could you actually optimize your utilization and your yield to even drive greater margins than you’re seeing right now or maybe you should bring down capacity utilization closer to 95%? Do you get some optimization benefits there?
John Coyne: Two pieces in my response to that; the first relating to utilization, once again last quarter, the opportunity provided by our customers exceeded our expectation and consequently our desire to get utilizations down into the mid 90’s we didn’t achieve that. We ran at higher than 95% utilization all through the quarter. The second part of the question is correct. When you’re running at close to 100% utilization we lose some of the key value that we like to bring to customers which is the flexibility and availability equation to satisfy their needs for change. That’s number one. Number two, when you’re running very full there do tend to be some inefficiencies related to meeting the customer needs while running very full. So there is some sub optimized situations. [audio break]
Operator: Please continue to hold. You may resume. Your next question comes from [Ben Rightsez – Barclays Capital]
[Ben Rightsez – Barclays Capital]: The question is about the longer term. As you now when you have gross margins like this and then you still keep your long term range where it is, you run into the problem that you’ve got earnings potentially next year, depending on quickly you want to get back down to target range. So I guess my question is how are you thinking about the longer term given the conditions in the short term with that predicament? Are you targeting, maybe you don’t want to go into FY11 but knowing that we have the difficulty, do you think that the industry and what you’re hearing into the next fiscal year supports earnings growth given what we have to model with gross margins?
John Coyne: Let me try to tackle that and I apologize for the dropped line. I’m not sure what happened. We are looking at the industry as I mentioned, we’re looking at we think a fundamental change in the demand for storage and an increase in that demand. And to some extend, the delinking of that demand from the underlying GDP growth rates or at least a multiplication of demand relative to GDP growth rates. So that’s a very, very positive thing. We believe that our drive technology is going to offer the most compelling solution for those increasing storage demands going forward for the foreseeable future. We believe you’ve seen in our performance and Seagate’s performance in the past quarter, I think you’re beginning to see the power of the large scale, vertically integrated companies when executing effectively and the consequent ability to continue to invest substantially in the technology to drive future solutions to that storage demand. So I think all of those things point towards a very positive environment. We’re not yet at the point where we’re altering our model, but I believe the vectors for storage needs, the consolidation in the industry, the consolidation in the supply chain, I think are all pointing towards an ability to up that model in the future.
[Ben Rightsez – Barclays Capital]: With regard to the enterprise in terms of, you mentioned it’s not big enough to break out yet, your SAS product and you’re happy with it. What do you see as your pace of new product introductions? What should we expect? And what should we also expect on the FSD side in that vein?
John Coyne: Clearly a single product is not going to support the needs of our customers in the traditional enterprise space and we have a developed road map which we have discussed with customers and which we believe addresses a significant amount of their needs. I think on the previous call I indicated our expectation that within three years the enterprise, traditional enterprise space would be serviced over 90% by 2.5 inch 10K and that our solution for higher performance than that would be addressed with solid state. I also indicated we expect to have an enterprise ready solid state product line offering in 2011 and so we’ll continue to expand the current drive base 2.5 inch 10K SAS, continue to expand that product line over the course of this year and follow up with an extension to the product line with higher performance products in 2011.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan: I was wondering first if you could maybe help us in terms of understanding the second part of the answer you were providing to my question earlier in terms of when can you restore that flexibility to address your customer needs and maybe reallocate to optimize the business proposition. And then the follow up I wanted to ask earlier was just if you could talk a little more about the structural change we could be seeing in terms of desk top resurgence and the emerging markets. Do you see more of the power of computers coming back and is it something that can stick around for more than just a few quarters?
John Coyne: I’m not sure exactly where we dropped you and I apologize for that. What our objective is, is to get back to the low to mid 90’s in terms of utilization so that we have ongoing day to day flexibility to move with the market. I don’t see accomplishing that in the current quarter. I’m hoping we’ll be able to achieve that in the June quarter, so that’s about the timing. And that’s driven just by our ability to bring in and commission and install and qualify the capital to accomplish that from an overall capacity perspective.  In relation to desktop, I think that the primary driver there, there’s a healthy resurgence in desktop commercial desktop demand. That continues to be a price sensitive business and the difference between replacing a desktop system which potentially can reuse a lot of accessories and so on versus going to mobile, combine that with CIO concerns about security and mobility of data and so on, I think there’s good life ahead of us in the desktop PC arena. On the consumer side of the desktop, it’s really the high end machines there that offer the geeks and freaks ability to configure systems out as they desire with very high performance, high capacity solutions. And then of course the 3.5 inch drives going into external solutions where increasingly we’re seeing adoption of home network systems; things like the WD World edition and WD Sharespace which provide whole home solutions for multiple network computers that are very simple to operate. These also have a healthy appetite for very high capacity 3.5 inch drives. So I think they’re the fundamental drivers of demand there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities.
Kevin Hunt – Hapoalim Securities: I had a question on the R&D. It’s been ramping up over the last quarter or two and based on the guidance you gave it looks like it will continue so I wanted to understand is that something you expect will continue to ramp up going forward and maybe you could help us understand what sort of target that is?
John Coyne:  I think the R&D spending with ramp. The percentage as a percent of revenue will be relatively static. You can see our total OpEx actually is down. Our range is 9% to 10%. We’re down at 8.2%.  If we continue, which I certainly hope we can, to grow revenue at a similar pace on a long term basis that we’ve achieved over the past number of years, then you can anticipate that our dollar spending in R&D will continue to increase. And back to my earlier comment about the ability of the large scale fully integrated companies to invest in the future of this technology, those investments are not trivial. They are over the next three to five years some very significant technical hurdles to be over come, new technologies to be introduced and we are currently spending heavily in those areas to ensure that our current ability to delivery industry leading capacities, ramp them into stable higher reliability products, that ability to lead the industry is maintained as we move through the significant technology changes in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey – Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey – Goldman Sachs: Since the December quarter you’ve seen a steady shift in your business towards distributors and away from the OEM’s. Can you talk about the strategy behind this and the impact that it’s had on ASP’s?
John Coyne: I have to re-characterize that a little. There has been no shift away from OEM’s. In fact we’ve increase our OEM business and we continue to provide very strong support of our OEM opportunities for growth.  We are also mindful of the opportunities in distribution and in branded and we’re continuing to apply resource and product allocation to those areas also. So we’re growing all across the board. If you look at the numbers for last quarter, the market grew by eight million units. We grew by 5.4 million units and a piece of those 5.4 million units went to each of the markets that we serve.
David Bailey – Goldman Sachs: Your head count has come up a decent amount since June. I think it’s around 9,000. How should we expect this to trend going forward and where have you been allocating the resources?
John Coyne: Head count primarily the head count increases are related to production personnel in our Asia facilities, heads, media and drives. If you run the numbers back over the last couple of years you’ll see that our productivity continues to improve as we ramp. But as we ramp substantial volumes we will also substantial people. We have increased our technical head count also and our professional head count and in those areas we’re now back at levels that are higher than pre recession levels. The good news about that process where we reduced some head count across the board last December through March has allowed us to rebuild with more current and future oriented skill sets and we have a significantly stronger professional and technical employee base today than we had a year ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kaushik Roy – Wedbush Securities.
Kaushik Roy – Wedbush Securities: 2010 seems like it’s going to be a good year. What could go wrong? Let’s say when all the capacity comes on line for two or three quarters, what’s your sense for calendar ’10?
John Coyne: We believe that the underlying digital content creation, the underlying life style changes and dependencies on the internet and the delivery and consumption of content, we believe these are very strong secular moves that are offering a growth path that is layered on top of the modest recovery that we’re seeing in worldwide economic activity today. Frankly we think the worldwide economic recovery is a lot more fragile that the growth in demand for digital content distribution and storage of all kinds. So what could go wrong would be I think the primary concern would be a macro economic event, a macro economic deterioration and where we’re watching actual demand very closely and events in the world around us to track that and what we can do in that environment if it were to occur would be similar to what we did when it occurred last year. On the other front, I think concerns that seem to swirl around about capacity investments being made in the industry are way over blown. If you look at our capital investment behavior over the past several years and recognize that the activities in which we’re investing haven’t significantly changed. If you go back to 2003 we were a pure play drive assembly company with very low CapEx requirements. We added heads which engendered a significant increase in CapEx requirements. We then added media in 2007 which adds a further level of CapEx requirement. But in all cases, we have been very close coupled in terms of our investment decisions relative to, all made on a back off the day we think they’re needed by the lead time of the equipment. We work very hard with our capital equipment supply base to limit those lead times and continually shorten those lead times. So we’re very focused on just in time investment to support what we believe is real demand.  We’ve also shown in the last year, a willingness and ability to tune our utilization of the assets that we have in invested in to the actual market requirements, and we’ve demonstrated that doing that, that behavior generates far more reward for us than any other behavior. I think most of our colleagues in the industry similar learning and similar behavior. So I’m very positive about the industry’s ability to see what’s going on in terms of real demand and take appropriate actions to match supply to that demand.  The biggest concern I have right now is that the level of investment being put into capital by the extended supply chain is inadequate to support the opportunities that we believe are there through the end of the calendar year.
Kaushik Roy – Wedbush Securities: Going to the gross margin question, do you think December was the peak gross margin or you could possible see better margins sometime during this calendar year?
John Coyne: We always seek to improve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Looking at the gross margin for this current quarter, taking the mid point of your guidance it appears that it looks like it’s assuming somewhere around a 25% or so gross margin. Is that the way to think about it? Are you conservatively guiding for that or why would we see some type of contraction if so?
Timothy Leydon: I think it’s closer to 24% on the midpoint and we’re guiding to that because we believe that as I’ve indicated previously, we talked about the market size. We indicated that we think it will be in the 152 to 158 million range. We also have got strength in 2.5 inch. We’ve got the strongest position there, the strongest market position and that’s got the most competition. As well, we’re servicing gaming and small form factor turn their attention to servicing that market in the March time frame after the Christmas rush. So consequently those are the reason why we’re looking at the decline in margin. And it’s pretty similar to the decline that we heard yesterday from Seagate.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: With that said, relative to that it sounds like the potential upside would be more or less just driven by volume or it seems like everything else is remaining fairly stable through the quarter so is that a fair assumption?
Timothy Leydon: We seek to optimize everywhere we can improving costs, improving mix, taking advantage of the market demand and assuming inventory stays in balance and the rest of the folks in the industry are rational.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: I know it’s a small revenue contribution but it is growing here over the last couple of quarters, your non hard drive business, and I would assume that’s a lot of the industrial, military stuff, how should we think about that from a model perspective here as we move forward because if we take what we’ve seen, if that starts to become somewhat meaningful here as we move out over the next 12 to 18 months.
John Coyne: I expect it will. You’ll observe from the numbers that the combination of media players and solid state drives taken together are the fastest growing component of our business and they’re both growing and we anticipate they will both continue to grow. Again, I think we’ll break them out somewhat more as they become individually larger and significant to the overall business results. I’m not quite sure when that will be. The sooner the better as far as I’m concerned.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Is it fair to assume that that carries a much better gross margin structure relative to the high end of your 18 to 23?
John Coyne: What we’ve given before from a stratification view point on gross margin we’ve got the engineering products which is enterprise and SSD has the highest margin. The next tier margin comes from the consumer type products which is DDR, branded and WD TV and the lower tier is the OEM heavy products which is desktop and notebook.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley: Earlier this week EMC refreshed its mid range storage systems with SATA only drive. Is that indicative of end user demand for cheaper and lower power consumption storage this year?
John Coyne: Yes, we believe it is and some two years ago now we introduced the WD Greenpower drive technology to the market and we’re seeing increasing adoption of that technology both in external storage, in DVR’s in notebooks, in desktops and in the enterprise SATA environment. We think that technology provides a significant value where we’re seeing customers acknowledge that. Certainly there’s a lot of work going on in the enterprise environment that is developing the management tools to come up with more effective tiered storage solutions that are using I think the system that EMC announced last week if I’m not mistaken, had an SSD layer and high capacity ATA for the bulk storage providing a complete high performance, high capacity storage system. We believe that’s a significant trend as we look out into the future and we’re aiming to have products to support that trend.
Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley: You talked about bringing channel inventory up a little bit between now and June but what would you expect to do with your own inventory levels between now and June as you prepare to serve the seasonal demand in the back half of the year?
John Coyne: Assuming seasonality in the June quarter likely we would seek to level load our capital investment by increasing inventory exiting the June quarter to support what is typically a significant ramp requirement at the end of the September quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jayson Nolan – Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Nolan – Robert W. Baird: The trajectory of CapEx is declining a little bit into the second half of the fiscal year, maybe some thoughts there and is it in part a function of just external supply is not keeping pace?
Timothy Leydon: I’m not so sure. It’s only minor. We expect $176 million and $200 million so that’s $376 million. So it’s effectively exactly 50% of the upper part of our range of our $650 million to $750 million range.
Jayson Nolan – Robert W. Baird: Is there a reason why there wouldn’t be upward pressure to it in the second half?
Timothy Leydon: We started off originally with our CapEx forecast at the beginning of the year we had $600 million and at that stage we were actually front end loading that $600 million in order to deal with the strong demand that we foresaw in the September and December quarters and as we have seen the unexpectedly strong demand from then on, we’ve been turning to add capacity on a just in time basis and that’s really what we’re aiming to do. So we would like if we really had our choice we would really like to book capacity in the weaker quarters in order to be ready for the stronger quarters, but we try to do things on a just in time basis because we’re trying to respond to customer needs. So I think our capital position is adequate to address what we see as the strong demand. If it comes out stronger we’ll make provisions to increase it if necessary.
Jayson Nolan – Robert W. Baird: If you could just talk to use of cash in general as it builds up here on your balance sheet.
Timothy Leydon: We kept our cash during the downturn mainly because at the time, lots of things have been forgotten now, but at the time we were wondering whether we had enough cash and with the macro economic situation being the way it was. We still remain cautious but we’re using it for operational and strategic purposes as opposed to using it for capital restructuring or whatever. Our goal is to find and extend product lines and to spend money operationally because we believe that in the long them that that provides the best value and the best return for our shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from Douglas Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners.
Douglas Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: I wondered if you could break out CapEx into a maintenance level for given output and incremental. Just looking over the past year over long range to be able to see that difference in what is maintenance level versus growth.
Timothy Leydon: From a CapEx viewpoint our model is to stay within 7% to 8% of revenue and in the past when we were not vertically integrated we had a lesser percentage. Then as we added heads and more lately media, it went from about 6.5% prior to media up to 7% to 8% that we have right now. When we look at the capital you have to look at over a long term. If you look at it in shorter terms it can appear lumpy but over the longer term, we’ve pretty much been almost three way between heads, media and assembly and test, pretty much split evenly. We don’t have a number to tell you about the replenishment number.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah – Brean Murray.
Ananda Baruah – Brean Murray:  I guess a philosophical question, is there anything taking the capacity down to the low to mid 90’s, that’s still a pretty healthy level, the if you take the capacity down there is there anything on the pricing side that says that pricing as a rule would decline at more typical levels again. And then if that’s the case could there also be an argument to be made to say maybe it’s healthier to keep it at mid 90’s to high 90’s if we can keep pricing a little bit more stable.
John Coyne: Actually it’s to the contrary. By operating at 93% to 95% on a planned basis against our anticipation of overall demand volume it allows us the flexibility to respond to opportunity to go after mix opportunities that are outside the scope of our pre-planned production. Traditionally, WD has done very well in building customer satisfaction on the one hand which tends to be sticky and on the other hand building profitability by jumping into opportunities presented by missteps by competition or by changed market conditions that are recognized late and where customers are seeking to respond quickly to that. So having that flexibility to respond in short order to upside opportunities or to mix changes is actually a benefit when it comes to overall financial performance.
Ananda Baruah – Brean Murray: Is there any way to at least order of magnitude separate out how much of the gross margin upside to the sort of normalized model range is due to the high capacity utilization levels versus mix versus what’s been pretty stable pricing on like for like.
John Coyne: On the gross margin, we know those numbers. We actually have if we look at it for last quarter from a ranking viewpoint, cost improvement was number one. Mix was number two. Utilization was number three and then we had benign pricing percentage.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Walker – FTN Equity Capital Markets.
Robert Walker – FTN Equity Capital Markets: You mentioned the industry supply chain investments, you’ve seen those lagging the opportunity you see which is a constrained demand for the whole year. Do you think OEM’s might order in calendar Q2 in anticipation of a third quarter, fourth quarter demand?
John Coyne: That’s a possibility that there will be some modest activity of that kind. Certainly our discussions with our large OEM customers are much more focused on availability and our commitment to support their plans through the back half of the year so that potential would be part of those discussions
Robert Walker – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Last night Seagate mentioned a 170 to 180 range for a quarter would be difficult for the industry to hit. Do you see that as well and I guess when do you see capacity finally kind of catching up with demand? Is that not until early 2011?
John Coyne: I think yes to both. That’s my concern about industry supply chain investments, that the timeline relative to those investments even if made today, it’s going to be a push to get significant output from those investments in the back half of 2010. So I believe we’re going to run constrained all the way through the back half of the year and into ’11. Thank you all for joining us today. I apologize about the brief interruption in service during the call. We look forward to keeping you informed of progress in the quarters ahead. Thank you.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today’s call will be available on the investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.  I will now turn the call over to John Coyne, President and CEO of Western Digital. 
John F. Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. For the second consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was stronger than we expected as the positive industry conditions that first materialized in the June quarter continued throughout the September quarter. The demand strength is primarily consumer driven, and we believe it is underpinned by the growing social media phenomenon. This is creating strong demand in mobile and desktop PCs, near-line enterprise and external storage markets. We believe that overall hard drive industry shipments totaled 152 million units in the quarter, flat with the year-ago quarter and up 15% sequentially from 132 million units in the June quarter. Inventory of ATA drives in distribution was down from 33 to 30 days quarter-on-quarter, while drive manufacturer’s inventory was further reduced from a historically low 7 days of sales ending the June quarter to just under 6 days at the end of September, reflecting both the unexpectedly strong demand and continued industry discipline in managing the vitally important supply/demand dynamic. We are very pleased with our progress in Fiscal Q1 in addressing our primary objective of sustained profitable growth. For the second consecutive quarter, we increased our weekly production rate by over 18 percent in a supply constrained environment, providing strong support of our customers’ growth opportunities. Continued customer preference for WD products, upside in overall market demand and outstanding execution by the WD team generated record revenue on record unit shipments. A moderate pricing environment, combined with our passionate focus on cost and efficiency, enabled gross margin above the high end of our model range. We contained operating expenses under the low end of our model, while growing our R&D investment 7% year-on-year and 8% sequentially. We continue to realize tangible benefit from the substantial investments we have made in technology, products, processes and capacity over the last several years.  We continue to lead the industry in time-to–market volume shipments of leading capacity points in all segments of the ATA drive market. In Q1 we began shipping our WD Scorpio Blue 1TB, 750GB and 640GB hard drives utilizing 333 GB-per platter technology. Additionally we led the market with shipment of our 2TB 3.5-inch hard drives to the Near-Line Enterprise, External Storage, Desktop, and CE markets. In Branded Products, we continued to grow our business in Q1, even as we simultaneously refreshed our entire External Storage product line-up. Our stylish, new offerings include smaller, smarter, more portable and secure MyPassport and MyBook solutions that feature new WD SmartWare backup, synchronization and content visualization software, hardware encryption and our innovative E-Label display -- all delivering additional value and ease of use to the consumer. This product-refresh positions us well for continued growth as we enter the holiday season and the year ahead. We also expanded our line of media players with the introduction of the WD TV Mini, with support for the RealVideo format, providing an affordable and convenient way for consumers to play their stored digital content and the WD TV Live, featuring network connectivity and 1080p resolution. Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the upside opportunities that emerged throughout the quarter. Once again we have further strengthened WD in our long-term mission of generating sustained profitable growth. Tim. 
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. Throughout the September quarter, hard drive industry demand exceeded supply. We again leveraged our agility in response to this unexpectedly robust demand. As we enter the December quarter, demand remains strong and our product line-up, availability and low cost profile position us to benefit from the continuing growth opportunity. As I discuss our quarter-on-quarter sequential changes, I would like to remind you that our September quarter consisted of 13 weeks, while the June quarter consisted of 14 weeks. Revenue for our first fiscal quarter was $2.2 billion, up 5% from the prior year and 15% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 44.1 million units, up 12% from the prior-year period and 10% sequentially. Non-hard drive revenue, including sales of WD TV Media Players, solid-state drives, media and substrates totaled approximately $36 million compared to $5 million in the prior year and $27 million in the June quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $49 per unit, down $4 from the year-ago quarter, but up $1 from the June quarter. Our Q1 ASP reflects a stable pricing environment, driven largely by the favorable market conditions.  Demand for our HDD products in the September quarter was stronger sequentially than we would have expected based on historical seasonal-norms, and particularly so when compared to what we had perceived was an already strong June quarter. We believe the total number of hard drives sold was 152 million compared to our original assumption of 135 million to 140 million units. We shipped 19.2 million mobile drives in the September quarter, compared to 14.6 million in the year-ago quarter and 16.9 million in the June quarter. During the September quarter, we shipped 3.1 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.9 million in the year-ago quarter and 3.7 million in the June quarter.  Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV, was $382 million, flat with the year-ago quarter and up 20% sequentially from $318 million in the June quarter. Industry pricing was more rational in this market during the quarter as supply and demand became more balanced.  Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results, revenue by channel was 52% OEM, 31% distribution, and 17% branded products in the September quarter, compared with 56%, 26% and 18% in the year-ago quarter and 54%, 29% and 17% in the June quarter, respectively. There were two customers, Dell and HP, that each comprised more than 10% of our total revenue. The geographic split of our revenue was 22% Americas, 22% Europe, and 56% Asia, as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the year-ago quarter and 24%, 22% and 54% in the June quarter. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 23.3% up from 20.1% in the year-ago quarter and 19.2% in the June quarter. This improvement in gross margin was driven by stronger than anticipated demand leading to moderate price reductions, better factory and supply chain utilization, and favorable product mix. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $195 million, or 8.8% of revenue. This compares with $190 million, or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter, and $184 million, or 9.5% of revenue in the June quarter. Our current spending reflects increased investments in technological advancements, new products and programs, and includes our recently acquired SSD business. Operating income was $319 million, or 14.4% of revenue. This compares with $234 million, or 11.1% of revenue in the year-ago quarter, and $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue in the June quarter. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $2 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $29 million, or 9.1% of pretax income. For fiscal 2010, we expect our book effective tax rate to range between 7% and 10% as we take into account our expected continuing profitability and the global mix of income by region. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year. Our net income totaled $288 million, or $1.25 per share. This compares with $211 million, or $0.93 per share, and $196 million, or $0.86 per share in the year-ago and June quarters respectively. Turning to the balance sheet, for the September quarter our cash conversion cycle was a negative 4 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding, 21 days of inventory, or 17 turns, and 72 days of payables. We generated $434 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $176 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $121 million. We also made our second quarterly debt-repayment installment of $19 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $262 million, ending at $2.056 billion.  We are carrying a healthy cash balance as we monitor the continuing macroeconomic uncertainty. The 44.1 million hard drives we shipped in the September quarter represent a new output record for the company. Consequently, in order to support continued customer demand for WD products and thereby maintain the pace of our profitable growth, we now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 to be $650 million, compared with our original projection of $600 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is now expected to be about $540 million. Over the medium term, we believe that the HDD market offers us substantial profitable growth opportunities in the existing markets we serve as well as in market segments yet to be addressed and in new applications for storage. Over the longer term, we will also evaluate investments in product line expansion both internally and externally to develop further growth opportunities. We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization and we continue to weigh the merits of further repurchases against internal and external investment alternatives. Now I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2010.  First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. With the notable exception of last year, the December quarter has historically been the industry’s strongest demand period, driven by consumer spending during the annual holiday season. We are encouraged by the positive PC and consumer electronics demand commentary from related industry bellwethers and the continuing industry supply/demand discipline. However, we expect that global macroeconomic conditions will remain challenging for both the consumer and the corporate buyer as unemployment remains high and credit availability remains tight in all major economic regions. Taking these various factors into account, we are modeling market volumes in a range of 152 million to 160 million units. We remain focused on supply/demand equilibrium and we expect to use our flexible and agile business model to respond quickly to demand changes. We anticipate that pricing will be rational based on supply/demand balance in all markets.  As a result, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion.  We are modeling gross margins of 23.3%, flat with our September quarter. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $200 million.  Our net interest expense is projected to be about $2 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be about 9% of pretax income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 232 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $1.26 and $1.36 for the December quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Richard Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: A couple of questions, I guess first obviously on the CapEx side, can you talk about just from an industry perspective how linearly you can add the capacity as you see the demand situation unfold in 2010? I think that that’s one of the areas that is of primary concern to investors, just to make sure the industry doesn’t over-expand but at the same time can adjust to upside as it sees it. Any color on that?
John F. Coyne: I think we need to bear in mind the background in the industry. Essentially since calendar Q4 of ’07, the industry has had an installed demonstrated capacity in excess of 155 million units per quarter. Since that time, on a quarterly basis, I think the industry has reacted very well to the actual demand in the marketplace and adjusted utilization of installed capacity to address demand as demand emerged, particularly so since Q4 of ’08 and through the first couple of quarters of this calendar year.  So I think the concerns about installed capacity are a little overblown.  Secondly, from a Western Digital perspective, we have been adding capacity on a just-in-time basis to address real demand from our customers as it has emerged. We, as Tim mentioned, our 44.1 million units last quarter was a record for the company, an all-time record for the company. We continue to see strong demand from our customers. We continue to be very encouraged by the demonstration through the last six months in terms of the recovery of demand once an inventory adjustment had been made, says to me that that PCs and the ability to store and distribute digitized content is becoming a necessity to today’s lifestyle rather than an extra. And so I believe there is very strong underlying demand that will continue.  As we look at the -- we don’t know what the industry plans are for investment going forward. When we look at Western Digital CapEx plans, our investments in heads and media tend to be on a six to 12-month outbound decision-making, so that we need to decide now what we think the market is going to look like a year from now in terms of our investments in our wafer fab and our slider fab from a head perspective, and in our media substrate and sputtering operations.  In our assembly operations, both the assembly of our heads into a GAs and headstacks and the assembly of our drives, our lead times are much shorter horizon than that and tend to be in the three month to six month time horizon. So we’re making decisions in relation to assembly capacity essentially on a three-month lead of our view of the market. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, that’s very helpful. Just switching gears a little to margins, obviously the model was able to generate higher than your traditional target range. What is your view now as we head into next calendar year, even for the potential for a PC refresh and such for what the margins can be going forward?
Tim Leyden: Well, 18% to 23% is our long-term margin model and there’s always room for margin expansion in the short-term. We can get that on the cost side through factory utilization, through efficiency, and through product mix. And of course on the revenue side, we can get it from capacity mix, segment mix, better linearity, et cetera.  We can be tactical with that in the near term but over the longer term, what we’ve learned from history is that it gravitates towards the high-end of our margin model in seasonally stronger quarters and in seasonally weaker quarters, it’s below the midpoint of our margin model range. So I mean, there is -- I think bottom line is there is room for margin expansion very much depends on market conditions, inventory, supply/demand balance and of course, behavior of the competition. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Hunt with [Hapolim] Securities.
Kevin Hunt - Hapolim Securities: Two questions, actually -- these are just to follow-up on that question -- is there any thought that your long-term gross margin sort of modeling range is going to be permanently up from where it’s been?
Tim Leyden: We’ve indicated that we are going to be entering the traditional enterprise market during the course of the year and when that happens, we will review our model but I think if you look at our model right now and match it up with the model that our peers have, or Seagate specifically, we believe that we are aligned rather well with that margin model because we have primarily and pretty much exclusively HEA product and segment mix and Seagate has the benefit of the traditional enterprise, and I think if you do the math, I think that you will see that the models align rather well. 
Kevin Hunt - Hapolim Securities: Okay, and then you just queued up my second follow-up question, which was maybe you could discuss longer term what you really think your opportunity is in the enterprise space, given that historically you haven’t really been there in the traditional sense, but you know, we had EMC this morning talking a lot about the solid state drives penetrating that space. You’ve indicated you were going to have something else sometime in the next year on that front. Can you maybe just give us an update on sort of competitively where you think you can go there?
John F. Coyne: I think our objective is to be as competitive and as significant in that market over time as we have become in every other market segment that we have developed products for and provided availability, quality, reliability, and service to. 
Kevin Hunt - Hapolim Securities: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: I was hoping to get a little more detail on the limitations you are seeing in the industry. Some people have talked about component shortages and I was curious to see what you guys saw this quarter in terms of component shortages and what you see for the December quarter. 
John F. Coyne: I think the industry as a whole, the entire supply chain is tight pretty much across the board, and I believe that’s primarily an outcome of the strength of demand that significantly exceeded expectations, the expectations of our customers as communicated to us, our expectations as communicated to our supply base. And I think the industry has been ratcheting up the -- our view of opportunity and consequently trying to ramp production to support that and that has stretched the supply chain. There are -- so everything is pretty tight. There’s been some spotty shortages in that chain, primarily in substrates, class substrates for 2.5-inch media, is probably the tightest.  But overall, I think the industry has performed pretty well in stepping up to the opportunities and satisfying the majority but not all of the demand. And I think it’s very important to continue to do that because if we fail our customers in terms of ability to supply to their needs for them to satisfy their growth opportunities, then they will find alternatives. So it behooves us to ensure that we are finding a way to address the temporary tightness and shortages in the supply chain to take advantage of and to support the opportunities that our customers are providing. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s helpful. And then in terms of your visibility into the channel and into your OEM customers, I know some people have some concerns that there’s been some over-building, possibly some double ordering, maybe we have too many PCs out there in anticipation for a build-up related to the new Windows 7 operating system and the holiday season. What are you guys seeing in terms of your business and what do you think about those concerns?
John F. Coyne: Well, I mentioned the -- I mean, the inventory situation in the drive business is extremely lean. It’s at the lowest levels that we’ve seen in over three years. So if we then move on to the -- what visibility we have into our customer base and the pipelines between them and the end consumer, it’s our belief looking at all of the available data that the back-to-school builds were pretty much correctly targeted at the market demand that emerged during a back-to-school season. We are now kind of based off that positive, we are looking at the builds that are in transit to the market for the holiday season. And the kind of seasonal indicators seem to be lining up very well for a positive holiday season. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: A question on your internal inventory -- are the current turns sustainable or do you need to add more internal inventory to meet demand as you go forward?
John F. Coyne: 17 is probably a bit sporty from a turns perspective and I think we had indicated our model is in the 14-ish kind of range, 14 to 16. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you, and then you were very constructive on the consumer. Have you seen any signs of improvement in the corporate space?
John F. Coyne: We’ve seen a little up-tick in the enterprise side of the corporate space. We’ve not seen much in the way of tick-up in the commercial PC environment. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Earlier in your prepared remarks you talked about how in the September quarter, demand outpaced supply -- can you talk about set against that backdrop, how WD [inaudible] maybe to pick and choose revenues in terms of winning placements at higher margin business? Any change there and could you talk about some of the underlying factors there in terms of either OEM decisions or maybe your competitors having trouble, particularly over in Asia?
Tim Leyden: As far as competitors are concerned, we really don’t have any insight into that. I mean, we always execute our business by balancing customer support and tactically optimizing margins so you saw that there was a slight swing towards Asia in terms of regional and I think there was maybe a 2% switch from OEMs to distribution in the channel, and we were strong pretty much across all business units. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: And then as far as the refresh of the external backup passport and mybook, just kind of curious, [inaudible] sort of channel fill or that be kind of a measured outreach to your customers in terms of that new product placement?
John F. Coyne: Well, I mean, we pretty much end of life the existing product line and positioned the new product lines during the course of the month of September and early October, so we now pretty well positioned across all regions, all channels with the refreshed products, both in the mobile 2.5-inch passport and in the 3.5-inch mybook product line, so we are feeling very good about the management of that transition, the fact that while typically you tend to get a kind of pause in sales in those while you are trying to take out the old and restock the new. We’ve actually maintained and grown very significantly quarter over quarter while we were accomplishing that. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: And then just lastly if I could, building off of the earlier questions related to the enterprise and the potential margins uptake, how should investors think about any sort of OpEx one-time hit in terms of maybe a quarter or two where as you rammed your enterprise business and you have maybe a little more hand-holding from the customers and from maybe some [inaudible] rewrites, what have you -- will there be anything like that in terms of OpEx maybe taking off maybe more than you expected as you first bring out the enterprise drives or -- 
Tim Leyden: We’ve bee spending in order to make our entry into that marketplace for quite some time because it takes quite a while in order to be able to design the product and then work through the particular issues with the customers, the qualification issues. So we anticipate that there will be maybe a small up-tick in customer support but other than that, it will be very, very minimal and we expect to stay within our margin, our OpEx model range, which is 9% to 10%. 
John F. Coyne: To amplify that, the vast bulk of the OpEx related to our enterprise business is already embedded in our current spending. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thanks, gentlemen. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital.
Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital: I had a question for you on the competitive environment -- have you seen any benefits in terms of pricing from the recent competitor consolidation? In addition, have you been given any additional consideration from OEMs as a primary source or a secondary source here as a result of the recent combination and does that have any effect on your near-term guidance? And then I just had a quick follow-up. 
John F. Coyne: Well, I think as you’ve seen over the past couple of quarters, since the announcement of the latest combination in the industry and very typical of all previous combinations in the industry, there were some significant share shifts during the two quarters immediately following the announcement. And we were beneficiaries of some of that.  The real -- what we are observing in the market today is the primary attribute is availability and if you look at WD's performance over the last two quarters, compared with the rest of the industry, WD has stepped up and supplied the majority of the incremental product that was demanded by the market within short lead time.  So we feel very good about the business model which we have honed over the years that is highly focused on speed and agility and responsiveness and we believe that one of the critical factors that has driven our success is that not only do we provide -- offer great products to our customers but that we make them available in a timely manner relative to their desires. And that has allowed us to consistently over the past five to seven years demonstrate market leading share growth and margins to match. So being consistently profitable is a reflection of the value that our customers place in our business model. 
Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up question on margins, if I could, kind of looking at almost a perfect situation here, a perfect storm so to speak -- is there -- what other things should we be thinking about from a gross margin standpoint as the utilization rates decline as you add in capacity and inventories grow from these levels? What other levers should we be thinking about outside of mix and the enterprise here in the next few quarters?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think our utilization rates don’t change as we add capacity because we add capacity in line with demand. Certainly our utilizations were lower during the period from October through March last year, October ’08 to March ’09, because we had not predicted the huge drop in demand that was a result of the economic meltdown and you can't shed capacity quite as rapidly as you can build it, but you can stop using it, which is what we did.  But as we add capacity, we add capacity in very relatively small increments to match our market opportunity and our aim is to keep our utilizations high at all times. 
Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess the first question, I believe last quarter you had alluded to a more Western Digital like mix of business as a driver to the gross margin. I’d just like to understand -- did we see that more normalized mix of WD business or should we expect that to happen here still going forward as we see the commercial market start to improve?
Tim Leyden: I think what we alluded to last quarter was that we were tactically selective in how we pursued the business and in this quarter, obviously with the supply chasing demand, we have actually pursued the business that is most beneficial to us and our customers. So we are more in line, what I would say, at market mix at this stage but we still have -- we still have opportunity to be able to deploy more recent technology. As a matter of fact, in the last quarter we were deploying more older technology because of the fact that we were being tactical in the markets that we chose to pursue. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: And a follow-up question, if I can -- on the share repurchase front, obviously you guys have a decent authorization still at hand. Any color on what you are looking for, either be it market dynamics or other things in order to become more active on the share repurchase? Do you have any gauge on what -- you know, when or maybe how we might expect you guys to start to become active on the share repurchase front?
Tim Leyden: When we are weighing the opportunities for the cash balance, our long-term goal obviously is to create shareholder value and we’ve got lots of factors to weigh. We’ve got to weigh near-term versus long-term objectives. We’ve got to weigh the prepare for opportunities versus what the macro risk is. We’ve got to look at the opportunity cost of replacement capital, if we have opportunities after we’ve actually purchased shares. And we are weighing all that on an ongoing basis but we are satisfied with what our choices are at this particular point in time. We are also cautious as we approach the market because what we have learned from the lessons of history is that when there’s a significant change in market factors that the velocity of the departure of liquidity can be fairly astounding. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray, Carret & Co.
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Could you comment or give us some sense of what your capacity is currently?
John F. Coyne: I guess it would be 44.11 million units. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Or maybe 44.2. 
John F. Coyne: No, I mean -- so we were -- very high rates of utilization and we are adding capacity to support the guidance that Tim just gave a few moments ago. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Got it, and I guess of the incremental CapEx spend, is there any way to sort of parse out how much you think will go towards capacity of -- expanding capacity of the different components -- drives versus media versus [heads]?
Tim Leyden: It’s probably a little bit weighted towards heads and 50-50 for the remainder, so it’s about 40% heads and then 30-30 for the other two. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Okay, great, that’s helpful. And I guess just circling back on uses of cash, I guess away from potentially getting the buy-back going again, I mean, what should we think of in terms of I guess the core uses of the cash as we head into first half of 2010?
Tim Leyden: Our primary bias would be operational. I mean, we are still pretty cautious relative to the macro situation and we are also looking, as I indicated in my comments, we are also looking at longer term growth opportunities in related type markets so those are our primary biases. But it’s more operational bias than alternative. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Got it, and I mean, with the levels you have, does that sort of increase -- I mean, you guys have always been a pretty active on the M&A front, you know, prudently but active -- does it increase your appetite at all, just knowing you have the kind of cash that you do on the balance sheet to go out and do something?
Tim Leyden: I mean, that specifically doesn’t increase our appetite. What increases our appetite is the -- is looking at the long-term creation of shareholder value and just paying attention to how do we best execute that in the near-term and in the long-term. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. 
John F. Coyne: I just want to circle back for a second on the -- give you a little more color on the capacity and CapEx question. In the last six months, we have been running our capacity close to 98%, 99% utilization. That’s very good for the short-term margin and absorption benefit. However, it inhibits our ability to provide one of the critical values that we provide to customers which is availability and responsiveness. So our target is to run at about a 90% utilization. And we will -- we are adding capacity in order to accomplish two things -- one, to keep up with the demands of our customers and two, to restore our flexibility in order to be enabled to meet their day-to-day, week-to-week changes and provide the right products at the right time. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: I appreciate that. That’s actually quite helpful commentary. So if I could just throw a quick follow-up in off of that one, understanding that you are going to add capacity, whatever you add, you are going to do it prudently. Given your outlook for kind of the December quarter TAM and then whatever your internal thinking is right now about [inaudible] into Q1, and given what you are thinking that your incremental add could be as we go through the December quarter, is there any reason to think -- this is really a gross margin question -- is there any reason to think in a stable ASP environment that the gross margin kind of ticked down in the March quarter would be anything more significant than what it has been over the years in a normalized environment, stable environment?
Tim Leyden: It’s hard to answer that question. There are so many variables -- I mean, there are various product segment mix. It’s the interaction of price, volume, mix, and cost and the most significant weighting factor is obviously supply demand balance and inventory management and -- but what we have seen historically as I mentioned earlier is that for our margin range in the weaker quarters, we tend to be below the midpoint of the 18% to 23% range, and stronger quarters, we tend to be above the midpoint. So that’s about as much color as we can probably figure out at this stage. 
Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Okay, thanks a lot. Much appreciated. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: You mentioned the channel inventory is at three-year lows. How much of that is a function of strong demand pull through the channel versus strong OEM sales and just not having enough product to ship into the channel? And then as a second question, how many quarters do you think it will take for those channel inventories to get back to more normal levels?
John F. Coyne: I think what we are actually seeing in the channel is partly a result of the tightness in credit -- that has -- I believe has reset the model in the channel to -- and has leaned out inventories and is creating a much tighter link between sell-through and sell-in. So I think we are seeing an adjustment to the model and the distributors are finding a way to operate with much tighter inventories and I suspect they will like it, and so I suspect that as the economy recovers and credit loosens and so on, that the model will stay leaner than it was before the economic meltdown of last year. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so the volatility in channel inventory levels is probably less than it maybe was in the past and you wouldn’t expect a snap back but more of a gradual increase as the economy recovers?
John F. Coyne: Right. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Stivy from Equity AFS Capital.
Robert Stivy - Equity AFS Capital : That 98% capacity number seems almost unsustainably high. When you think about the CapEx budget that you guys have going forward and what you guys expect total units to be produced, how long do you think it is going to take you to get more down to that 90% reasonable level of capacity?
John F. Coyne: Well, it depends on demand. I mean, we are modeling our CapEx. Tim just gave you the uplift to our CapEx number for the full year of $50 million, which is designed to take us back to our normal operating model, which is kind of in the -- we like to operate in the 90% to 95% range and for the last two quarters, we’ve been -- in the first of June quarter, we were bringing idled capacity back into play and in the September quarter, we were stretching our previously installed capital to its maximum. And as we move into this quarter, we are bringing some new capital online in order to support the strength of demand that we have and hopefully in the early part of next year, we’ll begin to get back into our 90%, 95% where we can be even more responsive to our customers in terms of giving them the mix they want when they want it. 
Robert Stivy - Equity AFS Capital : In relation to the idle capacity, with bringing on that other [inaudible], like in Thailand, can you give us an understanding of how much incremental available capacity that gives you guys when it runs for a full quarter in Q2 that you guys didn’t have in Q1 and Q4 of last year?
John F. Coyne: I think I’ve given you pretty much as much as I can give you. We were flat out last quarter. That facility was online last quarter. 
Robert Stivy - Equity AFS Capital : For the full quarter?
John F. Coyne: Pretty much. 
Robert Stivy - Equity AFS Capital : And can you just give me an idea of the trend of demand through the quarter -- was it generally as -- like a normal Q1 or was it a little flatter, a little more steep than normal in relation to a ramp for the holiday season and for the Windows 7 release?
John F. Coyne: It’s probably -- the last two quarters it’s probably been the most linear that we’ve had in the history of the company. 
Robert Stivy - Equity AFS Capital : Thank you so much, gentlemen. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. 
Analyst for Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets: Your headcount increased pretty significantly during the quarter. Can you provide more detail on the reason for this increase? 
John F. Coyne: 44.1 million drives, and associated components, heads, and media. 
Analyst for Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And for your consumer business, specifically the DVR business, it was much lower than your competitor’s results. Can you provide more color on what is going on there?
John F. Coyne: I think -- well, our number relates to the DVR market. I believe the competitor number you are referring to relates to DVR, surveillance, and gaming. 
Analyst for Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from [Arun Sharma] with UBS. 
Arun Sharma - UBS: I just had a quick question -- you commented last quarter that the linearity for the June quarter was actually the most linear quarter you had had. How would you describe the linearity you saw during the September quarter, or a surprise September quarter? And thus far into October, if you can comment, any idea how December may play out in terms of linearity? Thanks. 
Tim Leyden: John also mentioned that the September quarter was one of the most linear quarters that we encountered and in the December quarter, generally that tends to be a pretty linear quarter anyway and it’s because leading up to Christmas, we get the strength of demand in October and going into November as you go towards Black Friday. So we would characterize it as being pretty normal. 
John F. Coyne: You know, the fact that the strength of demand was relatively unforecasted tends to help linearity and that the -- you know, we’re building as much as we can build. 
Arun Sharma - UBS: Great, thanks. 
Operator: Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners, your line is open. 
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks. You’ve acknowledged some tightness in components. I’m wondering what your assumptions are for component cost increases in the December quarter underpinning your gross margin guidance?
Tim Leyden: We have forecasts for what the costs are and those costs are rolled into our gross margin guidance, so I mean, we’ve taken them into account and we are -- we’ve got good relationships with our vendors and our suppliers and we [inaudible] all the time. 
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: But are you expecting an increase relative to -- or rather are you expecting a slower rate of decline this quarter relative to September, given that tightness?
Tim Leyden: I’m hardly going to say that on the phone, Doug. 
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Sure, I’m looking for some color though. 
John F. Coyne: Okay, I want to thank all of you for joining us on today’s call. We look forward to keeping you informed of progress in the quarters ahead. Thank you.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's fourth quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. 
Bob Blair: Thank you. I would like to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning our inventory levels; industry conditions and demand; our gross margin and operating expense model; our future investments in technology, products and processes; our future product offerings and market segment participation; our cash usage; our expected capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and tax rate for fiscal 2010; and our financial results expectations for the September quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count, and earnings per share.  These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 24, 2009, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC earlier today.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.westerndigital.com. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today’s call will be available on the investors’ section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.  I will now turn the call over to Western Digital President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne. 
John Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal 2009 and June quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of the WD business model and the passion, nimbleness and capabilities of the WD team. In a very challenging year, we were continuously profitable and cash flow positive, despite absorbing $112 million in restructuring charges. As the economic environment deteriorated and impacted hard drive demand in the December quarter, we initiated actions to reduce our fixed cost structure in anticipation of a prolonged downturn in demand, relative to the previous trajectory of the industry. The results of these actions, which were largely completed in the March quarter, are reflected in our strong June quarter results.   Prompt and effective action by all industry participants quickly brought supply in line with the new demand levels and also dramatically reduced inventory by the end of March to the lowest levels in the last five years. Inventory has been further reduced in the June quarter with manufacturers’ inventory down from 9 days of sales at the end of March to just 7 days at the end of June, while distribution inventory, already at historically low levels exiting the March quarter, was reduced by a further 1 million units at the end of June. WD inventories exiting fiscal Q4 remain tightly controlled and have declined a little more than the rest of the industry. With the major adjustment of inventory levels now behind us, supply-demand balance restored and all industry participants appearing to be focused on the fundamentals of supply-demand discipline, profitability and cash management, we have seen some moderation in the rate of price erosion in the industry in the first half of calendar 2009. All of this heralds a better industry environment as we head into fiscal 2010.  In the recently-completed fourth fiscal quarter the market was much stronger than we originally anticipated in our April conference call which contemplated a market that was flat with the March quarter. Actual demand was up 18% quarter over quarter at 132 million units and flat with the prior year period. In this environment, we used our adaptability and responsiveness with telling effect, as we capitalized on this unexpected market upside, which we promptly converted into financial results that significantly exceeded expectations. This included a return to our targeted gross margin and operating expense business model parameters. Customer preference for WD’s quality, reliability, product breadth and responsiveness drove record shipments of 40 million units, up 27% sequentially and 14% over the prior year period. Revenue of $1.9 billion was up 21% sequentially but down 3% year-on-year.  Reflecting the damage done by a year of extraordinary industry price declines, year–on-year ASPs were down $8 to $48, while gross and net margins were down 210 and 50 basis points respectively.  However, sequentially gross and net margins improved by 330 and 710 basis points to 19.2% and 10.2% respectively, while our ASP erosion of $2 in the quarter reflects both a moderation in like-for-like pricing pressure and a WD mix-shift to take advantage of volume opportunities in the emerging Netbook market.  Our ability to make acceptable margins at the low end of the market, while at the same time returning to our targeted gross margin and operating expense model, speaks to our advantaged cost structure. We remain convinced of a continuing long term increase in demand for digital content storage. However, it remains difficult to predict the short and medium term influence of the continuing recession on true demand and historical seasonality. While we expect that the current quarter will provide continuing sequential growth, we are vigilant about macro economic developments that may lead to some choppiness in demand over the next several quarters. Consequently, we continue to supplement our customer demand forecasts with close monitoring of industry inventory, production and sales data and remain focused on further refining WD’s ability to adjust supply quantity and mix by product and regional market to ensure that we best serve our customer needs while we optimize our revenues and margins and continue our quest for sustained profitable growth. Our strategy to focus on the industry’s highest growth sectors of external storage and mobile PCs, combined with our intense emphasis on quality, cost and efficiency in both manufacturing and engineering, continued to pay dividends as our technology and product leadership in these high-growth markets served us well in fiscal 2009 and positions us well as we advance into the new fiscal year. Our consistent profitability and asset management have generated the strongest balance sheet in the industry. This has enabled us to continue to make substantial investments in the technology, products and processes needed to maintain the momentum we have been building over these last few years. Indeed, despite the fixed cost reductions we made mid-year, we have increased our R&D investments year-on-year.  Likewise, we continue to make prudent, well timed, capital investments to ensure that we have the capability to produce the product volumes which are required by market growth, increasing customer preference for WD’s existing products and to support our plans to further broaden our product offerings and market segment participation in the coming year. Throughout fiscal 2009, WD demonstrated increasing returns on its investments in technology, product breadth and production capability, with consistent delivery of compelling first-to-market products. The company maintained its momentum as an industry innovator with the announcement yesterday of another industry first -- the 1 terabyte My Passport Essential SE external storage device, which utilizes our newest WD Scorpio Blue, the industry’s only 2.5” hard drive with 333 gigabytes per platter. For the balance of fiscal 2010 we have very exciting product plans to further enhance our competitive advantage in the segments we have traditionally served. Additionally, we will enter the mainstream enterprise market with a family of 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM SAS hard drives. We will extend our WD TV media player product line to further expand this consumer segment. We have entered into an agreement with HP to design and manufacture a range of HP-branded external storage solutions for retail markets, further increasing WD’s reach into the consumer space. In the longer term, we are already engaged in the development of solid state storage solutions for the enterprise market which we expect to launch in fiscal 2011. Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the upside opportunities that emerged in the fourth fiscal quarter and for their responsiveness and commitment throughout a difficult but rewarding year in which we have further strengthened WD in our long term mission of generating sustained profitable growth. Tim. 
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. Fiscal 2009 brought macroeconomic challenges for the hard drive industry and for WD but these challenges gave us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with our financial performance. We have consistently portrayed the WD competitive advantages and capabilities in varying market conditions. These differentiators include our business model, our cost leadership, the adaptability and flexibility of our people, our data driven approach to identifying and satisfying market demands, our ability to make the desired product available to customers when required, and our willingness and capability to invest in R&D, component manufacturing, and capacity in order to broaden our product and production base. Our performance in the last two quarters demonstrates these abilities. We are now ideally positioned to leverage these strengths and continue to consolidate our position due to our balance sheet strength and our upside potential in unaddressed markets. For our full fiscal year 2009, total revenue was $7.5 billion. Hard drive revenue was $7.4 billion, shipments were 146 million units, and ASP was $51. Non-hard drive revenue, including sales of WD TV Media players, solid-state drives and external sales of media and substrates totaled approximately $75 million. The corresponding numbers for fiscal '08 were total revenue of $8.1 billion, hard drive revenue of $7.8 billion, shipments of 133 million units and ASP was $59. Non-hard drive revenue for fiscal 2008 totaled approximately $271 million consisting of external sales of media and substrates. Gross margin in fiscal '09 was 17.9% versus 21.5% in fiscal '08. Operating income for '09 was $519 million versus $1 billion in '08. And net income for '09 was $470 million versus $867 million in '08. Fiscal '09 EPS was $2.08 versus $3.84 in '08. Net income in '09 included a $14 million in-process R&D charge related to the acquisition of Silicon Systems, $112 million of restructuring charges, an $18 million gain on the sale of assets from the company’s media substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia, and $4 million of tax benefits related to the restructuring. Excluding these amounts, the 2009 non-GAAP net income was $574 million, or $2.54 per share. Fiscal 2008 net income included $60 million of net tax charges related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries, and $49 million of acquired in-process R&D expenses related to the acquisition of Komag. Excluding these amounts, 2008 non-GAAP net income was $976 million, or $4.32 per share. Turning to the 2009 fourth quarter results, total revenue was $1.9 billion, down 3% from the prior year but up 21% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 40 million units, up 14% from the prior-year period and up 27% sequentially. Non-hard drive revenue, including sales of WD TV media players, solid-state drives and external sales of media and substrates totaled approximately $27 million. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $48 per unit, down $2 from the March quarter, and $8 from the year-ago quarter. Our Q4 ASP reflects our response to the robust market demand for mobile and lower-capacity desktop products. The percentage of our hard drive revenue generated by non-desktop applications was 63% in the June quarter, 58% in the March quarter, and 63% in the year-ago quarter. We shipped 16.9 million 2.5-inch mobile drives in the June quarter, as compared to 10.1 million in the March quarter and 11.7 million in the year-ago quarter. These increases were driven by strength in notebook and netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference for WD product offerings. In consumer electronics, we shipped 3.7 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the June quarter, 3.5 million in the March quarter and 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Demand in the near-line enterprise segment exceeded our expectations. Our line-up of leadership products in this segment enabled us to continue to gain momentum in this market. On the desktop side, demand was modestly stronger than expected. We maintained position in this segment. Revenue by channel was 54% OEM, 29% distribution, and 17% branded products in the June quarter, compared with 48%, 30% and 22% in the March quarter, and 57%, 24% and 19% in the year-ago quarter respectively.  In the Branded products segment we maintained our leading market position while we focused on pursuing margin enhancement through cost and mix improvements. There was one customer, Dell, that comprised more than 10% of total revenue. The Q4 geographic split of our revenue was 24% Americas, 22% Europe, and 54% Asia, as compared to 26%, 28% and 46% in the March quarter, and 29%, 25% and 46% in the year-ago quarter. Our notebook shipments contributed to the relative strength of Asian sales. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 19.2% versus 15.9% in the March quarter and 21.3% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin versus Q3 came primarily from increased plant utilization due to higher volumes, improved efficiency, cost management and better pricing than expected while we had some offsetting impacts from product and segment mix. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $184 million, or 9.5% of revenue, up from the March quarter primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation accruals and SSD engineering additions.  On a year-over-year basis, we were able to fund increased investments in new products, programs, technological advancements, SSD engineering additions and higher incentive compensation accruals with the cost savings realized from our restructuring actions. Operating income was $209 million, or 10.8% of revenue, including the $5 million favorable restructuring adjustment and $18 million gain on sale of our Sarawak assets Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $2 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $11 million. Our net income totaled $196 million or $0.86 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal ’09, including $349 million during our fourth quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the fourth quarter was a positive two days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding, 24 days of inventory or 15 turns, and 69 days of payables. Capital expenditures for the June quarter were $111 million. And our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $122 million. Capital additions for fiscal '09 totaled $519 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '09 totaled $479 million. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the June quarter. We exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion as compared to $1.6 billion at the end of March as we continued to strengthen our balance sheet. The macroeconomic situation and the credit markets have not yet returned to normal and we will evaluate cash usage opportunities with this in mind. We remain focused on putting our available cash to use primarily through investments in areas that accelerate our business objectives.  Now I will discuss our expectations for capital, depreciation and tax for fiscal 2010, and wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter. We expect capital expenditures for the year to be about $600 million, and depreciation and amortization to be about $530 million. We expect our book effective tax rate to range between 7% and 10% and our cash tax rate to be between 2% and 3%.  Now I will move on to our guidance for Q1 2010. Positive indicators are emerging for the hard drive industry, but forecasting product demand remains challenging given the continuing worldwide economic uncertainty. With this in mind, and taking into account the strength of the demand in Q4, we are forecasting a sequential increase of between 3% and 6% in industry demand from 132 million units to between 135 million and 140 million units.  From a WD viewpoint, it is important to note that we had the benefit of 14-weeks in the June quarter. Taking this, the market growth forecasts and an expectation of normal seasonal pricing into account, we are forecasting total revenues for the current quarter to be between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. We're modeling gross margins to be approximately flat with fiscal Q4 2009. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $175 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $2 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be in the middle of the 7% to 10% range, and our share count to be approximately 230 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.75 and $0.82 for the September quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steven Fox with CSLA. Your line is open.
Steven Fox - CSLA: Good afternoon. A couple of questions on digging into the second half expectations by market, particularly when you look at the external market, how are you calculating or figuring out what the consumer could be doing in terms of external demand through second half? Any insight there would be helpful.  And then secondly, are you assuming that your strength in netbooks continues in the second half of the year?
John Coyne: I think we are being a little cautious in the 3% to 6% overall market guidance and we are not really seeing a lot of differentiation in our expectations relative to market segment. On the consumer side, while consumer has been reasonably strong through the first half of the calendar year, we remain concerned that the overall economic environment and potential impacts of that as we go forward, so I’d have to say approaching our view of the market with a little bit of caution but being positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, just like we did last quarter.  The netbook question, we anticipate that we will continue to see strength both in netbook and in the new CULV thin and light area. And a general comment about PC, both desktop and mobile, seeing a bit of a mix down, which is a typical reaction to recessionary type environment. 
Steven Fox - CSLA: Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, obviously like you said you responded to demand fairly quickly. Are there any bottlenecks that you had in the last quarter or that you are worried about either with you or industry wide for meeting demand in this current quarter that we should be aware of?
John Coyne: Well, I think certainly the level of demand last quarter exceeded industry expectations as well as WD expectations and in order to respond to that, the supply chain responded very rapidly to that up-tick but it did place stresses on the supply chain in general, and so we are running tight in several areas, probably the most notable of those would be glass substrates for the 2.5-inch space, which is the form factor that is showing the most growth. And also typically in these kinds of pull-in situations, you stress the long lead time components, such as semiconductor components. 
Steven Fox - CSLA: Got it. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions -- I guess first in terms of your target margin model, obviously you’ve already both reported a quarter and guided another. When you look at the $600 million of CapEx, given that utilization plays the major role in getting to that point, do you also see you being able to maintain that level going forward throughout at least fiscal 2010?
Tim Leyden: So the correlation between capital and margin -- let me take the margin question first. We are obviously pleased to be back in the margin range, in the margin model range. And we did so while shipping a market representative mix, which for us would be a lower mix than historically. But if inventory stays in line and industry participants stay focused on profitability and cash generation, we see ourselves being able to expand into that margin range.  From a CapEx viewpoint, we add capital on a just-in-time basis and we are -- and as you can see, we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter as we -- when we saw a market opportunity, we spent a little bit above what our expect capital profile was but we will continue to spend just in time and we are at the moment at the threshold of what our capacity is, because our previous highest shipments were somewhere around 39.6 million. So we continue to do things on a just-in-time basis and we will make adjustments as we go along. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: And you had in the past commented when it comes to the CapEx how much was kind of devoted for heads. There’s still, if I remember correctly, some portion of spend that’s required to finish that build-out. Can you just remind us on how the $600 million might break out?
Tim Leyden: Yeah, if you’ll recall when we started off last year, we had an $800 million capital spending plan and that included about $150 million of 8-inch spending per heads. And while we have actually run the pilot line and improved the process, we haven’t spent the money in order to increase the capacity because we haven’t needed it at this point and it’s not in that $600 million number, so consequently -- but we do expect to stay within our model range, which is 7% to 8% of revenue as we go forward. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and then just lastly, when it comes to the HP announcement, I don’t know how much you can discuss about that product for the consumer market but it seems to be a little bit unique that you are helping them design this. For a long time, everyone has been supplying many of the vendors the hard drive piece of this but is there anything you can elaborate on that and how you see it playing within your own product line, or what the response is even within the consumer Best Buys of the world and stuff like that?
John Coyne: Well, in fact HP have already announced the product line as HP Simple Save, and it will be stocked worldwide in similar channels. HP’s retail channels are similar to our own. We see it as a complementary brand to the strength of the WD brand. We see it as a way to further expand our presence in that marketplace, given the already very significant market share of the WD brand. And we are very happy that we’ve been able to form a strategic partnership with a very well-known worldwide brand, rather than relying on the vagaries of the smaller brands that participate in the external storage market. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Will this revenue appear as a branded sale or as a disk drive sale?
John Coyne: It will be in our branded business. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much and well done. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. I just wanted to ask, you guys had a 14-week quarter this quarter, and it sounded like from Seagate’s comments that the end of the quarter continued to be strong and there was some question about if business got pulled into the second quarter from the third quarter. I appreciate that you guys have given some conservative guidance for that but I was curious how much of the upside in your units do you think came from that extra week that you had?
John Coyne: The last quarter was probably the most linear quarter we’ve had in the history of the company, so you can take the $40 million, divide by 14, you know how much we shipped in the final week. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then in terms of the revenue guidance, it seems a little bit more conservative than Seagate. I guess my question would be do you think that your ASP assumptions are slightly different than Seagate? It doesn’t sound like you guys think you are going to gain share, or it is just that you are being conservative and because of the second week that your revenue guidance is a little bit lower?
John Coyne: Well, if you take the market growth forecast and adjust upwards for and then adjust down for the 14th and 13th week, they practically cancel each other out and so we are -- with ASP, historical ASP trends in Q1 and with a slight mix-up with -- we get to the numbers that we have. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, so it’s really the extra week that impacts that?
John Coyne: Yes.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachmann with BMO Capital Markets.
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Two things -- the first one for you, John, if I could -- I’m going to ask the same question I asked to Seagate; if I look at what the TAM did in June, as you said it looks like it’s up about 18%. Intel and IDC and others have suggested that the PC market was up anywhere from 3% to 5% in the same June quarter period. Clearly your inventories are in good shape on your books and Seagate’s are as well. How do you respond to some of the challenges that there has to be some extra inventory about potentially at the OEMs?
John Coyne: I think you’ve got to bear in mind that the PC sales increase is a PC sales increase. The -- 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Sorry, John, that was the unit number I gave you on PCs. 
John Coyne: Yes, unit sales. And we are heading into the back-to-school period which typically gets fulfilled from a system build and ship perspective. The majority of that product is being shipped on ocean and so it’s built in the May June timeframe in order to land to support the late July/August type sales sell-through. So I mean, we are very keenly interested to see the outcome of the back-to-school season because it’s very important to validate what we’ve observed thus far in the year, which is that consumer demand has held up pretty well.  So I think back to school is going to be important, relative to understanding what the December quarter supply demand situation is going to look like in order to -- you know, if back to school is strong, then you could anticipate that there will be further demand to support by end of the year typical seasonal situation in PC. If back to school is weak, then obviously some of the systems that were built for back to school will slide to the right a little bit and that could dampen demand as we go into the December quarter. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, fair enough. Let me ask a follow-up then, if I could, for either of you -- there seems to be some issues, as you mentioned, around the availability of glass. John or Tim, is there any view on where you run out of supply? In other words, if the TAM on the 2.5 increases beyond a certain point, I’ve gotten some feedback from even mid-60s in terms of units. Is there some threshold that you think the industry, there just isn’t enough supply of glass to fulfill the 2.5-inch market, depending on the size of the TAM in the September quarter?
John Coyne: Well, I mean obviously there’s some number that could create that environment but right now we think there’s -- while supply is tight in the industry from a substrate perspective because there was a lot of capacity taken offline in the December through March period and it’s being put back in a very measured way. I think the real issue is that we work very closely with our supply base to ensure that they understand what the end demand is that we are seeing and that that capacity get brought back online in a timely manner to support the demand. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks very much, John. My final one, Tim, a real quick one for you -- I don’t know if you said this but average ASP in September, is it flat, down, or up you think from 48?
Tim Leyden: In September, we expect that price declines will moderate and we expect that there will be a slight mix-up, so consequently it will be flat with an upward bias, we think. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Cihra with Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: On the product side, I just have two questions, if I could -- one on, or actually sorry a couple on notebook first. With the 333 gigabytes per platter now launched at least in the branded, I guess two questions there -- one, is that three platter configuration, is that kind of just a specialty thing that you see for retail or is that something that could actually become sort of a notebook configuration? And then I guess also along the same lines, just with that product now and the retail branded stuff, when do you see that starting to make its way into PCs? And then I have a follow-up, if that’s all right. 
John Coyne: Our choice to develop the 1-terabyte, three platter 12.5 millimeter form factor was driven by the size of the external market today and our position within the market and that justified the development of that product, which is primarily targeted at the external storage market. And we’ve seen in the 3.5-inch external storage, the huge demand from 1-terabyte is actually the 3.5-inch capacity point that sells the most units in the external market.  And so provide that capacity with the convenience of no power supply and total mobility and portability and we believe you’ve got a winning product in terms of consumer desire. So that was a compelling story for us to go do that development. We thought it was a very significant milestone step in the development of the external storage market, so that’s why we focused on that.  However, there are many chassis today and many chassis under development which accommodate the 12.5-millimeter form factor, and so we do expect to supply this product into a segment of the notebook market as well.  Meanwhile, we continue to develop a full line of products in the 9.5-millimeter form factor to support the broad-based notebook market. 
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: And have you started shipping that yet too, on the notebook side or is that something more in the September quarter or -- 
John Coyne: This is Western Digital. We announce products [when we ship in volume]. 
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: [You did it on a product], so that’s not actually pushing it. Okay, under the category of waiting to announce products, I guess I will just follow it up with the enterprise SAS product. You did say that fiscal ’10, you’ll be introducing that -- any -- I mean, care to say anything in terms of timing? Given how long qualification cycles are and that sort of thing, I mean, is that the type of thing where you will talk about [quals] or is it something that you’ll just talk about shipping, or any kind of -- is it something that’s still a calendar -- fiscal ’10 but calendar 09?
John Coyne: Well, again, what we will talk about when we are in volume production shipments of production product, we’ll talk about that. 
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company: Okay. All right, thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: John, could you just elaborate on your comments in your prepared comments on what your thoughts are for demand over the next few quarters? I think you said that you would expect choppy demand over the next few quarters after a pretty historical linear June quarter. Could you just elaborate on what your thoughts are for the next few quarters?
John Coyne: Yeah, I think it’s not so much that I -- we’re concerned that with the overarching economic environment, it’s difficult not to prepare ourselves for a W rather than a V, although we do anticipate that the second dip of the W will be significantly less than the first dip. But I think it would be fantastic but maybe a little unlikely that we are going to see an uninterrupted growth path from here.  I think the other thing that we are grappling with a little bit is that certainly since the December quarter, so December, March, and June quarters have all been non-seasonal from a historic, sequential growth or reduction perspective. So we are looking at the September quarter from the perspective of unusual strength in the June quarter, potentially dampening the sequential growth into the September quarter.  All that being said, we are spending time talking with customers, listening to their inputs relative to their business and their expectations but we are spending equal time, if not more time, focused on our flexible model that can respond to the real demand as it shows up, and I think the nimbleness of our model should be visible when you look at the fact in April here, we were looking at a market we expected to be flat sequentially that turned into an 18 point opportunity from an overall market point of view. And our execution turned it into substantially more for WD. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Great. In those discussions with your customers, are you getting any feelings of how they would expect the December quarter to play out as it regards to typical seasonality?
John Coyne: I think it’s a bit early to go to December. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Great, and then one last question, if I may -- along the same lines of discussions with customers, when are they telling you that they would hope to experience or see or even if they expect an improvement in demand on a PC refresh due to the release of Windows 7?
John Coyne: I think most of the commentary we’ve got relative to Windows 7 is more -- more an issue of when businesses begin to spend again in the IT sector. I think it’s -- so the indicator I think will be up-tick in enterprise, followed by kind of PC client system spending in the commercial sector. And I think the more important driver is company confidence about the recovery from the recession than a trigger such as Windows 7. I think Windows 7 may drive a little bit but I think the overarching thing is how are businesses performing in the recovery mode and how rapid is the recovery and how confident are businesses that the recovery is sustainable. And I think that’s going to reflect in refresh much more. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: You’ve commented on the moderation in pricing in both the June and your expectations for the September quarter. Can you give a little bit more detail of any variance by segment within the pricing?
Tim Leyden: We don’t actually give out that level of detail, David but if you’ll recall in the last quarter, we indicated that we were driving towards margin model with our different segments, where we were looking at it in three tiers. But the actual top tier is -- consists of enterprise and SSD, the mid tier consists of the consumer, which is PVR, DVR, and branded, and the lower tier consists of netbook, notebook, and desktop. And the reason for that is because the purchasing power of the customers at that particular -- in that particular tier.  And we are -- of the fixed tiers we have, there is one that is above the upper end of the margin tier and there is one that is slightly below the lower end of the margin tier at this particular point in time. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then when you think about the gross margin going into the September quarter, you are looking for that to be flat but volumes are going to be up. Is there an offset there that sort of pushes it down a little bit to keep it flat Q-over-Q?
Tim Leyden: Well, volumes are going to be pretty much offset by our 14 to 13 week movement. As I indicated, the expectation in the market increase is 3% to 6% and our -- if you convert from 14 weeks to 13 weeks, it offsets -- there’s a downturn of about the same amount. And then we do expect that pricing will moderate. We expect mix to be a little bit better and that’s how we get to the number. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: A couple of questions -- I guess I want to understand what you guys are seeing in the 2.5-inch market. If I look at what Seagate said about the TAM, it looks like you guys now could have been right around 30% share in the 2.5-inch market. So can you help us understand what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint, share shifts, and whether you think that you can continue to take share in that 2.5-inch space?
John Coyne: Well, I think obviously our results reflects customers who wanted to buy our product. We believe that the availability of that product was one of the critical factors there. We believe that the consistency of our quality, reliability, availability, flexibility in that and competitive overall pricing, and a very strong product portfolio, a very strong company, and a very strong product road map -- we think all of those things play into the strong customer preference for WD and we believe that is sustainable. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Let me ask it another way -- I mean, I think that we’ve seen some share shifts play themselves out with Fujitsu and Toshiba and that combination now expected to close in August. Would you agree with that and do you believe that there’s further share shifts still to play out from that combination?
John Coyne: Yeah, I think the data is shaping up with Seagate, ourselves, and HDST have reported numbers for the quarter and when you look at all of that, it appears that of the three remaining companies, Toshiba, Samsung and Fujitsu, that there has been share loss there. We have to wait for them to report specifics to understand where that share loss has been. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, fair enough. And then final question for me, on the retail side of the business, if you just -- given what you are disclosing for percentage of revenue, it looks like your revenue was down somewhere around 13% on a sequential basis and that looks like it is a little bit below what we saw out of Seagate. So can you help us understand the sequential pattern in your retail business? Was there any destocking of inventory? Was there any dynamics within that that caused that to be down on a sequential basis mid-teens?
John Coyne: Yeah, on a quarter over quarter basis, we did reduce the level of inventory in our branded channel deliberately. The other area to mention, probably in the last 18 months, the branded segment has been the one with the most competitive pricing dynamic across, and five out of those six quarters had double-digit price decline.  So while our unit volume is still strong in that area, unsustainable, highly competitive price declines which have been an issue over the last year, a little over a year. The effect of that is that we are maintaining our share in that market and we believe the other drive companies, we think that this whole dynamic is going to change that market significantly into one served primarily by the integrated drive companies. Every drive company in the world now has an active program to go directly to consumer under their own brand name, and so what it appears is that the smaller companies that are predominantly regional players who buy drives at the component level, their ability to sell gigabytes is compromised when the drive companies go into that market. So they need to find a real value to offer to the consumer, such as some kind of high engineering functionality, the small niche product areas that the drive companies may not yet be addressing. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. I’m going to sneak one last one in -- in your long-term gross margin guidance of 18% to 23%, is that inclusive of moving into new markets? Meaning as you move into new markets, we would still expect a range, that being the range going forward -- is that a fair assessment?
Tim Leyden: Yeah, the 18% to 23% was our historical segment mix so consequently there’s margin expansion opportunity if we enter new segments that have got gross margins that are higher than our average company gross margin at the moment. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Perfect. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could -- the first one is kind of a two-part, and I just want to get a sense if you can shed more light on the customer buying dynamics right now in terms of one, are you seeing more PC OEMs use boat to ship in the June quarter and can that be a wildcard as far as how it impacts September? And then secondly, are you seeing customers look for more bundling, i.e. trying to get more of the notebook and desktop procurement at the same time for a better price?
John Coyne: I think the -- to look at -- typically the consumer market has a higher level of defined SKUs in it, right? So for the retail market, manufacturers tend to build a specific configuration of product and those predefined products tend to ship ocean to minimize the freight cost. And typically those ocean shipments are timed to coincide with particular promotions in the retail channel. The more configure-to-order type business tends to get shipped air and then configured in region or shipped air preconfigured.  So that was the first one. The second one was -- oh, the desktop and notebook. I mean, I think certainly the large OEMs appreciate the value proposition of large suppliers with broad portfolios who have significant ongoing investment in the future of those broad portfolios in order to be able to support their businesses robustly into the future, and so I think there’s -- for many years, you’ve seen a progression of the large strategic OEMs putting more business towards the large vertically integrated profitable strong drive companies in order to secure their futures. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: I guess as a follow-up to that, is that helping you, John, in terms of having the luxury of being able to pick and choose your revenues here versus some of your peers, who have some distractions, if you will, in terms of -- you’re able to pursue the higher margin concentration out there?
John Coyne: Well I think what we -- to Tim’s comment earlier, I mean, what we did last quarter was to ship pretty much in line with industry mix, so from an average gigabyte shipped both in the 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch environment, we were pretty close to the industry average. And certainly that offers opportunity for mix-up should we choose to go there. You know, historically we’ve tended to be mixed up a little bit from the industry average. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then the second question is kind of building off of Aaron’s previous question regarding the longer term operating target model -- I want to get a sense with the entry into the enterprise class disk drives, just given your peer and the very significant profit pool that they do derive from this marketplace. How should we think about WD in terms of the OpEx investments required and I think typically the enterprise is a little more top heavy on fixed calls as relates to OpEx but I presume that the gross margin offset is pretty significant -- is that fair to think?
Tim Leyden: Yeah, I mean, we have been investing, I think John has mentioned this a number of times in the past couple of quarters, that we have already been investing in order to enter that marketplace. There’s probably some selling support that has to be added to the OpEx in order to be able to provide the type of support that those customers need. But I mean substantially, the expenditure in order to execute that business is already in the -- in our runway. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to follow-up on the conversation around the unit up-side in June. It’s clear that you believe those units are going into product for back to school but historically if you look at the PC and the drive shipments in the June quarter, they move much more in tandem, so I guess I want to understand what was different this year? Was it timing of some of the new netbook products that had to build volume? Was it OEMs worried about product availability if they didn’t build early or something else that drove the more significant disconnect between drives and PC shipments?
John Coyne: Well, I think there’s several considerations. First, the last three quarters have been totally atypical from a historical perspective, so it’s very hard to answer a question that supposes everything should be seasonally normal.  Second, the inventory in the drive industry both in the OEM channels and in distribution is at an all-time low. It’s running approximately half the level that existed throughout the entire year last year. We think that’s having an effect and certainly we know that the PC guys also did a lot of heavy breaking in the December and March quarters and are also trying to accelerate into demand. And when you do that, they are experiencing some spot shortages in LCD panels, in memory, in hard drives, and so yes, there may be a little bit of holding of inventory within the OEMs while they match up all the things that are short. You know, it’s unsafe to run everything to the most short component because as soon as you solve that, you’ve got to run off and solve the next one, so people tend to set their overall objective sourced to that and as they fill in specific shortages, they match it up with components that are holding temporarily in inventory. So I think all of those things are playing together to have created some incremental demand in the June quarter.  The really important thing I believe from a drive industry perspective is that we’ve further reduced inventory coming out of the June quarter, so in historical times, when those large surges in demand occurred, typically inventory got provisioned at a multiple of that demand. We’re not doing that this time. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And would you expect that that inventory levels on a secular basis have declined or are there some potential flags that the channel and you and some of your peers are looking for in the back half that would perhaps cause you to build back up inventory levels, be it demand and balance of all the different components mentioned?
John Coyne: I think there would have to be a very, very strong conviction that the recession was over and that a predictable, sustainable level of go-forward demand and traditional seasonality was back to have us even approach traditional levels of inventory. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird:  Thank you. A question on factory utilization first -- I assume with a record unit ship, utilizations were high but I guess John, can you compare the efficiencies on yield and test time to that factory utilization?
John Coyne: Yeah, I think the important thing to note is back in December, one of the decisions we made anticipating lower revenues, as well as lower unit volumes, was to close one of our factories in Thailand and that factory has not yet been re-commissioned. So we actually produced a record output of hard drives in a smaller factory footprint than we’ve ever done before. And that was deliberate in the sense that by constraining the available factory footprint, that creates an environment in which innovation and productivity need to continue even in a soft market. And so we benefited from that in driving yields, utilization, test time, efficiency, all of those things through the last quarter by putting that constraint on our overall capacity.  Now, given where we now are and the progression of average gigabytes shipped that carries on quarter to quarter, we will be recommissioning that facility this current quarter. 
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird:  Okay, and then just one last question for me on silicon systems, maybe an integration update and I guess you’d mentioned F11 from an enterprise SSD perspective but is there anything that we should expect from a progression standpoint in fiscal ’10 on SSDs?
John Coyne: Well, we are going to continue to -- the integration is pretty much done in terms of transferring silicon systems as the solid state storage business unit within WD and transferring all of the financials, the business activity on to the WD systems. That’s all complete.  We did launch a new range of solid state devices, the silicon drive 3, just a month ago and we intend to continue to grow the product line and participation in the traditional silicon systems market, which was the embedded storage market which is a complete new set of customers for us, primarily [Natcom], industrial, military, and so we will continue to prosecute that business. We will continue to roll out new products to support that business while we work on the engineering for the launch of a product into the traditional enterprise space. 
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird:  Sorry, just a follow-up there -- should we expect to see any relationship between qualifications in your SAS and SSD initiatives? Thank you. 
John Coyne: Well, I think -- yeah, it’s important -- you know, we’re approaching that marketplace as we enter the mainstream enterprise space, our desire was to be able to present a roadmap to our customers that gave them assurance of a commitment to that space and our ability on a long-term basis to satisfy all their needs in that space and I believe we are doing that with a family of the 10K SAS complemented by solid state for the high performance end of that space. 
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird:  Thanks, John. 
John Coyne: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress in the quarters ahead. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions). Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments in response to your questions concerning inventory levels in the June quarter, our ability to respond to future changes in demand, future investments in technology, and acceleration of our solid state drive programs by the intellectual property and technical expertise added through our acquisition of Silicon Systems, results of our restructuring activities and our expected cost and savings from these activities, our continued profitable growth, capital expenditures and deprecation and amortization for fiscal year 2009, and our financial results expectations for the June quarter, including revenue and gross margin, expenses, share count, restructuring costs, share count, and earnings per share. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 29, 2009, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the form 8-K that we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.westerndigital.com. I'd also like to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.  I would now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, President and CEO of Western Digital. 
John Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our March quarter financial performance. A result of crisp execution by the WD team, maintaining a focus on profitability and cash generation. We managed our market participation, product mix, and costs to optimize our returns in the challenging environment.  We maintained our overall market presence while holding gross margins flat with last quarter. Demand for ATA hard drives in the March quarter remain depressed from year ago levels, falling 12% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to 103 million drives, due to the continuing effects of the worldwide economic downturn. This demand was slightly better than the 13% quarterly decline we had expected. WD took a disciplined approach to supply during the March quarter. We reduced production to match drive shipments, which were down by 8% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter to 31.6 million units. Additionally, we reduced finished goods by one million drives.  We are encouraged by the supply demand dynamic in the industry and response to customers’ significant inventory reductions as they aligned with reduced demand levels, hard drive production was rapidly scaled back during the quarter.  Manufacturers inventories exiting the quarter for both 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch ATA drives were just over one week, while component inventory and distribution was at the low end of the normal four to six week range. As we anticipated, the pace and timing of demand reductions and inventory realignment have been different for the 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch markets. The 3.5 inch market is approximately 50% distribution and the majority of OEM supply chains are short, which drives air freighted to system assembly sites in the region of sale.  These supply chain characteristics lead to a very transparent and responsive market, which adjust rapidly to demand changes. In November and December, we saw this market undergo rapid demand decline, amplified by inventory adjustments in line with that demand change. The December quarter demand dropped by 8 million units or 12% quarter-over-quarter to 60 million units. We estimated that approximately half of this was inventory adjustment. March quarter, 3.5 inch ATA sales, were flat with the December quarter.  Distribution inventory was maintained flat as sell-out equaled sell-in, while manufacturers inventory was reduced by about one million units to one and one quarter weeks.  In contrast, the 2.5 inch market for hard drives is approximately 80% OEM with the majority using a China ODM assembly and ocean freight supply chain model. This, combined with the fact that this has historically been a high globe sector, meant that adjustments to the new market demand realities took somewhat longer to move through the chain.  Starting in January, we saw a massive inventory squeeze, which took 10 million units out of the market demand in the first two months of the quarter. This reduced demand from 53 million units in the December quarter to 43 million units in the March quarter, a 7% year-on-year and 18% quarter-on-quarter reduction. Again, the industry was quick to react on the supply side. Matching output closely to demand and additionally reducing manufacturers inventory by over 3 million units to 1.1 weeks of supply.  The industry built 12 million less 2.5 inch ata hard drives than in the prior quarter, a 20% quarter-on-quarter reduction in manufacturing activity. The balanced supply demand dynamic created in the quarter and the low level of inventory in both distribution and OEM channels are positives as we look forward into the June quarter; however, the most important determinant of our business performance in the quarter and into the second half of this year will be the true consumption trends. Significant uncertainty still remains about the magnitude of direction of end user demand.  We will keep our operations highly flexible to respond to whatever direction demand will take, while remaining highly focused on inventory, cash, cost, and profitability. The actions we have taken and are taking to resize and structure the business to remain profitable and cash flow positive at a $1.5 billion dollar revenue level are well advanced and are already showing up in our cost of goods and operating expense lines. While very focused on the control of operating expense, we continue to make substantial investments in future technologies and products. Indeed, despite the constraints of the current economic cycle and our consequent restructuring actions, we increased our March quarter R&D spending, excluding variable compensation, by 6% compared with the same period last year. This investment was funded by reductions in base SG&A of 10% year-on-year. Complimenting our internal investments, we are continuing our strategy of utilizing external developed technology by strengthening our relationships with industry-leading suppliers. In April, we concluded a new agreement with Showa Denko, extending our long-time partnership with them as a strategic supplier of advanced media. Our sustained investment in technology and product breadth continues to bear fruit. With our shipments of the industry’s first two tiered drive growing throughout the quarter supporting multiple applications in our component and branded products business.  This week, we announced an additional version of this two (tiered) drive for the high duty cycle, business critical enterprise market, again demonstrating WD’s ability to rapidly mature industry-leading technologies and mass production. We also extended our technology and product breadth during the quarter with the acquisition of Silicon Systems, which has become the WD solid state storage business unit with revenue in 2008 of $47 million and an established footprint in the industrial network communications, medical, aerospace, and military markets. The business is modestly accretive to WD.  The addition of Silicon Systems’ technical expertise will accelerate WD’s solid state drive development programs as we assess opportunity in the net book, client, and enterprise markets providing greater choice for our customers to satisfy all their future storage requirements. Integration into WD is well underway and proceeding according to plan. Our overall results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of the WD business model in all environments. Tim Leyden will now review these results for the March quarter in more detail and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Tim?
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. During the March quarter, the WD team continued its disciplined approach to market participation. Having sized capacity to match our expectation of demand, we paid close attention to the fundamentals of cash generation and profitability in a challenging macro economic environment. We did this by optimizing product mix, limited our participation in certain markets and concentrating on cost reduction and factory utilization.  We are pleased with the results of our actions to size the business to reflect demand realities that the industry faced and we sacrificed some near term share growth in order to make progress.  We are monitoring the market size and the supply demand balance and we are poised and well positioned to leverage our asset philosophy model to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities as the industry continues to cope with unpredictable demand patterns. Our revenue for the third fiscal quarter $1.6 billion, down 21% from the prior year hard drive revenue of $2 billion dollars, and down 13% sequentially.  Shipments totaled 31.6 million units, down 8% from the prior year and 11% sequentially.  Average hard drive selling price was approximately $50, down $2 from the December quarter and $9 from the year-ago quarter. Our Q3 ASP reflects a continued competitive pricing environment, particularly in the notebook market, where supply exceeded demand in the early part of the quarter and in the branded products market, where price degradation continued throughout the quarter.  Demand for our desktop products in the March quarter was stronger than historical season, resulting in increased volumes as compared to declines in all other markets. The strength in desktop was somewhat favorably impacted by replenishment of our customers’ inventories. As they had cut back orders significantly toward the end of the December quarter. This synonym was more pronounced and happened earlier in the desktop market than in other markets.  WD’s flexible supply model allowed us to quickly respond to these changes in the overall demand profile.  Demand for other products was affected most significantly by further inventory reductions driven by the overall weak consumer and commercial spending environment.  Our unit shipments of 2.5-inch drives were 10.1 million in the March quarter as compared to 10.2 in the year ago quarter and 13.8 million in the December quarter. In this market, in particularly in the earlier part of the quarter, we were selective in the business that we chose to pursue. We shipped 3.5 million 3.5 drives for use in digital video recorders in the March quarter as compared to 3.1 in the year-ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Revenue from sales of branded products was $343 million as compared to $330 million in the year ago quarter and $403 million in the December quarter. Industry pricing was particularly competitive in this market. We believe this was primarily driven by a large competitor liquidating excess inventory.  With the industry’s leading cost structure and compelling product lineup, we continue to view this market as a key contributor to WD’s long-term profitable growth.  Hard drive channel revenue was 48% OEM, 30% distribution and 22% branded products in the March quarter compared with 50%, 34% and 16% in the year ago quarter, and 57%, 21% and 22% in the December quarter respectively.  The Q3 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 26% Americas, 28% Europe and 46% Asia as compared to 28%, 31% and 41% in the year ago quarter and 23%, 29% and 48% in the December quarter. Demand strength in Asia, while more muted than in recent quarters due to the inventory correction in the 2.5 inch market, continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region and more recently by the affect of the Chinese government stimulus policy.  Our gross margin for the quarter was 15.9% down from the 22.6% we reported in the year ago quarter and flat with the December quarter. Total operating expenses of $192 million included $14 million charge for in process R&D related to the Silicon Systems acquisition and $4 million of cost associated with the restructuring plan announced in the December quarter. Excluding these restructuring charges, total on R&D and SG&A was $174 million for the March quarter, $13 million higher than the total R&D and SG&A reported in the December quarter. December OpEx benefited from a $16 million reversal of a prior quarter bonus accrual and a zero bonus for the period, whereas the March quarter included a $14 million bonus accrual. Adjusting for these changes, the R&D and SG&A for the March quarter was down $17 million dollars from December.  Restructuring charges related to the resizing plan we announced in December of 2008 have totaled $117 million to date, $4 million of which was incurred in the March quarter. We now expect the total cost of our restructuring to be about $122 million. This is lower than the $140 million forecasted on our January call.  We continue to expect the annual savings of the restructuring to be approximately $150 million once all actions are completed, including the $14 million in process R&D charge and $4 million restructuring charge, operating income was $61 million or 3.8% of revenue. Excluding these charges, operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $79 million or 5% of revenue. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $3 million. This includes about $1 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments in auction rate securities. These investments totaled $18 million at the end of the quarter. Tax expense for the March quarter was $8 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect our tax rate to range between 8% and 10% as we take into account our expected continuing profitability and the global mix of income by region. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 2% and 3% for the fiscal year.  Including the $14 million dollars in process R&D charge, and the $4 million restructuring charge, net income totaled $50 million, or $0.22 per share, excluding these charges, net income on a non-GAAP basis was$68 million or $0.30 per share. Turning to the balance sheet for the March quarter, our conversion cycle was 5 days, which consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 68 days of payables. We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations. We paid out a net of $44 million related to the Silicon Systems acquisition. Capital expenditures were $106 million and depreciation and amortization expense totaled $119 million. Cash and cash equivalent increased by $203 million, ending at $1.6 billion dollars. In the June quarter, we will be paying out an additional $19 million related to the Silicon Systems acquisition, bringing the total net cash paid to $63 million. We will also be making our first quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million. A summary of our debt repayment schedule was included in our most recent 10K filing. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be about $500 million. This is consistent with the reduced forecast we provided on our January call. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $480 million. We won’t be providing a fiscal 2010 capital forecast during our July earnings call.  We did not repurchase any shares of stock during the March quarter. We continue to carry a healthy cash balance was we navigate the current economic downturn. We’ll continue to manage our cash conservatively until demand visibility becomes clearer and the economic uncertainty abates.  Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2009.  You will recall that we indicated on several occasions that this quarter will be a 14-week quarter with our fiscal year ending on July 3, 2009. First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. Historically, the June quarter's sequential unit volume has been flat to slightly down. Global macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and while we have seen much progress toward inventory rationalization in the industry, we expect demand patterns to be less predictable than would be the case if normal seasonal conditions were present. Taking into account the inventory situation, our 14-week quarter and other known variables, we are modeling market volumes that will be essentially flat at the March quarter. We believe in a commodity market such as ours that balancing a supply and demand continues to be critical and we remain focused on maintaining that equilibrium.  Our sequential ASP declines have been about 5% and we anticipate the pricing will continue to be competitive. The production realignment undertaken by the 3.5-inch industry participants has led to a better balance between supply, demand and inventory holding patterns and we are now seeing that dynamic extend to the 2.5-inch marketplace.  Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion.  We are modeling gross margin of 15.4%. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $175 million. This includes the combined incremental impact of OpEx spending related to our recent acquisition, as well as the 14th week in our current quarter. Restructuring costs are expected to be $5 million.  Our net interest expense is projected to be about $4 million, assuming no further losses in our investments and securities. We anticipate tax expense of between $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $227 million. As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.14 and $0.24. Excluding the $5 million of restructuring charges I outlined earlier, we estimate non-GAAP EPS of between $0.16 and $.26. This guidance excludes any impact from the possible disposal of our Sellawa facility.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Clearly this quarter you guys lost a little bit of share in 3.5 and 2.5 inch. What would be your plans going forward for share gains? Do you see a new pattern emerging where you want to be more cautious about share gains in your focus on profitability or do you still plan on additional share gains as we move through the year?
John Coyne: Our objective remains sustained profitable growth. Over the past five years or so, we’ve been putting together a broad product portfolio addressing multiple segments of the market. We have been successful in growing our position in each of those segments to a substantial level. Having achieved that balanced business portfolio, that affords us the ability tactically in any given quarter to be able to address market conditions by segment and manage the portfolio to achieve solid overall results.  Where on an overall drive industry basis, we maintained share. We gained a little bit in desktop. We lost a bit in the 2.5 inch space. When I say we lost it, we know exactly where it is. We haven’t actually misplaced it. As we look forward into the market, we continue with our profitable sustainable growth, we will continue to pursue growth in our existing market segments as that offers us appropriate rewards and continue to grow in new segments as we’ve indicated an intention to enter the enterprise, mission critical space and with the recent acquisition of the solid state business unit.  So you can expect that WD will continue to pursue sustained profitable growth. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: In terms of gross margin, I’m a little surprised that the gross margin guidance is down a bit. Is there anything particular we should think about there? Is that related to the 14-week quarter and do you see that as sort of a bottom for the gross margin?
Tim Leyden: When we look at the fourth quarter, generally it’s our most challenging quarter from a historical and seasonal viewpoint. In this quarter, we will incur 14 weeks of utilization and we won’t necessarily be able to have the sort of proportional increase due to the 14th week that we would normally anticipate. 
Operator: Next question comes from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your participation in the net book segment. I know last quarter you said you were sort of shying away from that and are you developing a cost optimized product for that segment?
John Coyne: I don’t recall indicating that we were shying away from net books. In fact we see the net book segment, which is one of the few areas in the computing and internet connected space and entertainment space that’s actually growing. We see it as a significant opportunity. We think last quarter there was about $5 and $6 million net books shipped and our participation in that market was similar to our participation in our traditional notebook environment. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Are your margins similar to the notebook margins as well?
Tim Leyden: Our margins are at the low end of our margin hierarchy, but low cost models we’re very well positioned in order to be able to participate in that and we’re satisfied with the margins that we’re getting in that segment.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open. 
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company:  Can you give us a little color on the dynamics for gross margin improvement sequentially? Is it the effect of restructuring or do you have your own aerial density changes going on?
Tim Leyden: John indicated how we participated in the market by being tactically opportunistic and so from a mix viewpoint we benefited from that. Then we did benefit from the improvement in utilization as we had resized our business and of course we worked on cost like always do.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company:  For the June quarter.
Tim Leyden: For the June quarter, we anticipate it to be the same thing as I indicated to Sherri. We won’t be able to get the same proportionality increase on 14 weeks from a revenue viewpoint. Production, we’re going to have to match production and cover the absorption for this proportionate overhead that’s going to go into the manufacturing overhead.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company:  Significant capacity has been taken out of the drive industry. Is there anything that gives you pause, John, that that has perhaps been impaired due to the downturn?
John Coyne: I think the fundamental structure in the supply base is sound. We’ve certainly sized our business to the opportunities we currently see. Historically, if emerging opportunities showed up, we have a track record of being pretty good about addressing them.  We do expect to see some spot shortages that, for instance, a number of wafer fabs in Asia today are running flat out and last quarter they were completely empty or significantly reduced.  So there will be a little bit of jerkiness in the supply chain I expect over the next couple of quarters as people try to understand the macro environment and respond appropriately, but structurally and on a medium term basis, I don’t see any fundamental issues. 
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company:  Inventory, have you started to see any rationality appear there at the OEM level? Are they starting to recognize that they aren’t going to get the type of ASP declines that they’ve gotten in recent quarters?
John Coyne: I think the OEM’s behavior is always rational. When the industry is foolish enough to produce significantly above demand, then pricing power moves to the large customers and they behave very rationally in that kind of environment. Job one for every procurement officer in every major company is availability. And so, in times when supply is short to demand, that becomes the major concern of the procurement department followed by good value for money. 
Operator: Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal, your line is open.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: First, Tim, on the cost saves that you’ve identified, can you give us an update on timing?
Tim Leyden: We’re on track for the conclusion during the June quarter.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: The distribution between cogs and OpEx in terms of that $150 million?
Tim Leyden: It’s about 60% OpEx and 40% cogs.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: You mentioned that one of your competitors has been more competitive in the retail space or branded space. Has that impacted the margins of that particular business, which has been very profitable for you in particular, and how do you see that unfolding going forward?
Tim Leyden: I didn’t indicate that one competitor was more competitive; I indicated that one competitor we thought was carrying out an inventory. So consequently that I think hurt wealth creation for many of us in the industry, but from a viewpoint of branded products and margins, we’re now from a hierarchy viewpoint if we look at it with just knowledge to give insight but not to give too much away competitively. We have classified the margin hierarchy into three different stratifications. First stratification is the heavily engineered type products, which is the enterprise and the SSD type products and then the second stratification comes in the consumer type products. There’s a cover for inventory carrying and other administrative overhead type of costs. So we have the second highest margin there. The third one comes in the commercial type products, which is desktop and laptop and of course the net book. \
Operator: Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital, your line is open.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Could you just remind me, Tim, what our gross margin target is?
Tim Leyden: The gross margin model, the long-term gross margin model is 18% to 23%. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Can you elaborate what’s going on in the leadership position in the 2.5 inch, 250 per platter. Do you guys think you’re there first? Do you think a few others will be there around the same time? 
John Coyne: Well clearly we led of the 250 gig per platter as we had done on the two previous generations. The next industry technology deployment will be 320 gig per platter in the 2.5 inch space and we fully expect to continue to be a leader in that space and we will on a broader context, you know, one of WD’s long-time’s strength has been our ability to manage the full portfolio of technologies within products and throughout our entire production chain, whether it’s our extended chain of merchant suppliers and our internal component factories as well as our drive factories, to manage our mix there to optimize our return on investment and maximize our margins and we continue to do that. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: On the hedge strategy, is that similar to previous strategies internal plus external?
John Coyne: Absolutely. We have for a long time had an approach to those technologies which we had internalized, media, of having a significant minority of that business on the outside in the merchant market. We worked very closely with those suppliers, TDK, SAE, on the head side, and the primary partner on the media side and we worked very diligently with them to assure our access to and utilization of technologies that they can bring to our ability to integrate those technologies and take them rapidly to market and by doing so, manage risk and new product introduction as well as manage total capital investments and total technology investments in our own business while getting majority of our components from our internal structure, which has lessened cost in the total package, we believe has been very successful and believe it will be continue to be successful for us.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: On the merger, do you think that leads to opportunities for you?
John Coyne: No deal is done ‘til it’s done, but for trying to predict the future, one tends to look at the past and certainly the last three mergers in the industry that included two parties with overlapping product lines resulted in opportunity for the non-merging companies in the industry. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Suggest that that market share shift has already begun, do you agree with that?
John Coyne: I would agree with that, yes.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: As we look to another competitor, (our check) is going to suggest that they have limited exposure in a lot of desktops, particularly N.A. a little bit and Europe, but only we’re sitting around in Asia. Do you think anybody is changing their commitment to the industry, which could be a positive long-term fundamental?
John Coyne: It’s very hard to tell. The model that we have developed allows us to operate very profitably and very well in the overall market environment as it exists today. So we don’t rely on changes in the structure of the industry for our survival and overall future. So the industry doesn’t have to change to make us successful, but changes in the overall structure could potentially be of benefit not only to us, but to the entire industry. 
Operator: Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas, your line is open.
Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas: I want to understand the gross margin a little bit more. I think last quarter in reference to a question that was asked on the call, I think the comment was made that as the industry realigns itself and it looks like that definitely is taken shape, that you guys would be able to get back into your targeted gross margin level of 18% to 23%. So if you strip out the 14-week quarter, I guess I’m trying to understand why we wouldn’t be getting close to that 18% to 23% level again.
Tim Leyden: Well we sized the business to be profitable and cash flow positive at $1.5 billion dollars and obviously with the industry conditions being the way they were and that profitability, and we indicated it as well with our earnings expectation, was that it was just going to be right around break even.  And so, as we go forward into the future and it will be very dependent on what conditions stay present in the industry, obviously we’ll have to grow a little bit from where we are at $1.5 billion. We probably have to grow somewhere to about halfway to what are previous revenue run rate was and then I think at that stage and with supply demand dynamics being somewhat in balance and our segment mixed in somewhat similar, then I think we can get to the low end of that 18% to 23% range under those conditions.
Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas: So you’re saying relative to the $1.5, take a halfway point to the $2.2 that you’ve kind of done in recent history in terms of quarterly revenue?
Tim Leyden: Yes.
Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas: And how much of an impact is the extra week in terms of the operating expense structure in this quarter and I’m trying to think about that giving the full extent of the cost savings as we roll into September and there forward.
Tim Leyden: Yes, I think it doesn’t compute to 14, 13, if you will, it probably computes more to like 13.75 in terms of what the OpEx run rate would be. 
Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas: Final questions for me. I want to make sure I have this clear. You’re saying that your tax expense will be $10 million dollars, is that right? 
Tim Leyden: Yes.
Aaron Rakers – Stiffel Nicholas: Okay, and then I guess I’m just trying to understand on the SSD, the Silicon Systems acquisition, understanding where they’re currently positioned, but can you speak to what addressable markets you really see in front of you for the SSD opportunity?
John Coyne: Sure. The SSD market, as we understand it in 2008, was about a $1.1 billion dollar market. That in context, our drive business in 2008 was a $35 billion dollar market. The projections that we’re synthesizing from all of the forecasters and from discussions internal and external show about a $5 billion dollar opportunity for SSD, three to four years out, and a $14 billion dollar opportunity for HDD, three to four years out.  Within that, the $1.1 billion last year, about $400-$450 million of that was in bedded systems, which is in the markets that Silicon Systems addresses with current product line. We believe the balance was a split between enterprise tier-zero type applications and notebook and net book applications.  We think most of the growth is in the forecasted growth. Most of that is in the enterprise and client computing and net book spaces.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz – JPMorgan, your line is open.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: You mentioned, John, that you extended your relationship with Show Denko. Does that mean that you guys maybe overpay for Komag or do you see the potential still for Komag to help you with your potential mission critical enterprise entry in terms of aluminum discs?
John Coyne: No, I certainly don’t think we overpaid for Komag. I think our results over the time period since we bought Komag more than demonstrate the value of that acquisition to our business.  The Showa Denko relationship, and in fact we also have relationships with other merchant market media suppliers, as well as sub straight suppliers, you know, are part of our long-term strategy of how we do internal/external blending to get the best technology, costs, quality, and risk profile for the business, and we’ve been consistent with that. We intend to continue to be consistent with that in mixing the majority, producing the majority of our internal heads in media, but buying a significant minority on a consistent basis over the long haul in the merchant marketplace.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Then as far as the earlier question regarding the proposed Fujitsu Toshiba merger, given Fujitsu’s kind of shall we say inconsistent execution within the mission critical enterprise, do you see this as really a prime opportunity for you to maybe accelerate your entry into mission critical or do you really see mission critical not being the top priority for WD in terms of growth? 
John Coyne: Our approach to the enterprise business as we assessed the opportunity in that space for many years, that assessment did not look positive in that there were multiple form factors, multiple interfaces, very low volumes of all of them and relatively stable volumes of all of them and multi competitors, and that was not a good opportunity set from our perspective. To address that, the engineering effort relative to the potential sales just didn’t map out.  Has the industry began to approach a series of transitions, 3.5 inch form factor to 2.5, studying cyber channel, then things began to look much different from our perspective with a segment of that mission critical market now standardizing on a 2.5 inch form factor with a sass interface, offering if you looked at that segment, which most forecasts indicate, will be by far the dominant sector over the next three years. That looks more attractive.  And so, we began investing in enterprise engineering some years ago and we are preparing to address the needs in that market. Now an interesting opportunity emerges as the tiering in that marketplace for high i-ops, high transactions, begins to see the advantage of solid state solutions against the multi-drive de-stroked, 15 K fiber channel solution to that problem. We see the opportunity to provide value to customers in the high end of the enterprise tier to compliment a mid-range sass space product and thereby be able to satisfy the total range of solutions on a forward-looking basis over the next several years. 
Operator: Scott Craig - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch, your line is open.
Scott Craig - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Can you guys comment on the impact that the bonus accruals will have in the coming quarter on the operating expense line. Secondly, how much cash did you actually had been taken out of the industry either in units or percentage when you think about both the 3.5 inch and the 2.5 inch based on your conversations with the industry?
Tim Leyden: Well on the bonus question, the accrual that we made this quarter is pretty typical, somewhere between $14-$20 million, actually between $10 and $20 million dollars, depending on how well the company is doing in absolute terms and relative to peers.  The second piece of question, capacity in the industry. I think what’s much more important than capacity in the industry is utilization of that capacity and how people are running production relative to overall demand and I think there’s some very positive signs there. I think the industry was tremendously responsive and fast in the last quarter and very disciplined in managing supply relative to demand.  I think the fact that over the last two quarters, our customers have taken about 10 million units out of inventory is another very positive sign, because when we’re trying to understand the macro economic impacts and trying to understand the real end user demand activity in the market, eliminating that 10 million of disconnect between what’s happening on the end customer side and what’s happening on the supply side is very important to getting a good match between supply and demand. So I’m very encouraged by all the behaviors I see and the fact that the inventory is not clouding the issue anymore. So now it becomes, the uncertainty is now around a true end demand and what the impacts of the macro economic environment are going to be on consumers and commercial demand.
Operator: Next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: What was the headcount growth year-on-year if you net out acquisitions and how do you expect headcount to trend over the next couple of quarters?
John Coyne: I don’t have the netting out the acquisitions necessarily closely to hand, but I certainly on a full year-over-year basis, we’ve grown about 2,000 people. On a sequential basis, we’ve come down 7,000 people from the December quarter.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Is there more work you can do on that front the next couple of quarters?
John Coyne: We don’t have any substantial plans in that area. We’re pretty much done, with the exception of our facility where Tim mentioned we continue to operate that facility as we continue to explore closure or disposal. In either event, our headcount will come down by about 500-600 people at that point.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: A quick follow-up, as it relates to the Silicon Systems acquisition, do you plan to add or integrate any of your own technology to their current solution or do you view that as largely a standalone business as you purchased it?
John Coyne: There are multiple facets to it. It is a revenue generator, a profitable business, that we will continue to pursue and we’d like to grow our presence in those markets, which we don’t currently. We didn’t previously as WD, but there’s also significant value from an engineering expertise and experienced perspective that we expect will have a positive effect when combined with our existing internal resources. I should clarify. We have grown by about 2,000 people on a year-over-year basis, but that does include the conversion of about 4,000 contract employees into full-time employees. So we’re on a real apples for apples basis. We’re down about 2,000 people on a year-over-year basis. 
Operator: Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners, your line is open.
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Can you comment on which segments WD chose to step away from in order to maintain supply demand balance and what’s driving those decisions?
John Coyne: Well I think the areas that we stepped away from a little bit, in 2.5 inch, we stepped back somewhat. We didn’t like the reward ratio in that business at the beginning of last quarter. So we stepped a little away from that. We stepped into the 3.5 inch space, which was offering better reward for our energy at that time.  We also created some space in the branded products arena to allow what we saw as a required blowout of excess inventory.
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Can you comment on the opportunity to gain market share at the next technology 320 gig per platter?
John Coyne: That’s the next technology and we’ll announce products when we’re shipping them. 
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thank you.
John Coyne: Okay, I think we’re done with questions. So in closing, I want to thank the entire WD team with strong results in such a challenging market condition are a testament to their adaptability, their perseverance, the capability and focus and motivation.  Despite the current state of the economy. We remain very encouraged by our long-term market opportunities. The applications driving digital content continue to multiply. Drive storage, delivering appropriately tiered, cost effective, high capacity storage, and high performance, low capacity transaction oriented solutions, will continue to provide great customer value in these markets and we remain committed to provide the best customer value proposition in the industry to deliver financial results, which allow us to continue making the substantial investments required to lead the industry and to generate superior returns for our supply partners, our employees, the communities in which we operate, and our shareholders. Thank you again for joining us today and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.

Baird
Operator: Welcome to Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions). Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. I want to mention as we begin that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions concerning demand in the hard drive industry; reductions in our expense and operation structure; our business restructuring plan and the associated impact on our ability to maintain operating expense, align capacity with demand and improve structural costs and gross margin range; the expected size, type and timing of charges and future original savings associated with our business restructuring plan; our ability to deliver industry-leading performance; market opportunities for high-capacity storage; our future investments; repurchases of our stock and management of our cash; goodwill impairment charges; our gross margin model cost structure and ability to remain profitable and cash flow positive; demand in pricing in the hard drive industry for the March quarter; and our financial results expectations for the March quarter, including revenue and gross margin, expenses, share count, restructuring costs and earnings per share. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2008, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K that we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.westerndigital.com. I'd also like to note that copies of remarks from today's call by John Coyne and Tim Leyden will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. And now I will turn the call over to President and CEO of Western Digital, John Coyne.
John Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In our last conference call, in October 2008, we were coming off a weak September quarter. And accordingly, in contrast to historical norms of 7% to 10% quarter-on-quarter growth, we provided what we believe was muted guidance for the December quarter of approximately 5% unit growth in our served markets for 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch ATA drives. However, as the quarter developed, we saw unprecedented macroeconomic conditions depress these already muted expectations with demand actually declining 14% sequentially, transforming the December quarter into one of the most challenging ever for WD and the entire hard drive industry. Instead of the 138 million units in served market demand which we expected, we saw a decline in industry shipments to 113 million, a negative swing of 25 million hard drives. The timing of this sudden demand shift gave us and others in the hard drive industry just two months to react and adjust. This rapid fall off in demand, amplified by customer inventory adjustments, further intensified the highly competitive pricing environment we experienced throughout calendar 2008. As we saw demand fall off dramatically in early November, we acted swiftly to align our production volumes and operating expenses, demonstrating the benefits of a well-coordinated, capable and committed team executing to a proven, fast, flexible and responsive business playbook. Our response yielded positive results and comparative profitability, cash generation, asset management and increased customer preference. While pleased with the performance of the team and the business model and addressing short term conditions, our assessment was that this was not just a one quarter anomaly, but rather a demand level reset, which would become the new base line for demand throughout calendar 2009. Consequently, we developed and put in motion a plan which resizes our expense and operational structure to a revenue expectation for calendar 2009, some 25% below what we achieved in calendar 2008. The details of this plan, which involved headcount, compensation, and work hour reductions across all areas of the company. As well as closure of facilities in both our component and hard drive manufacturing operations were outlined in the form 8-K, we filed with the SEC on December 17, 2008. These actions, which we expect to complete within the March quarter, are designed to maintain our operating expense in the range of 9% to 11% of revenues at the $1.5 billion level. The resizing of production capacity through work hour and headcount reductions, facility closures and equipment retirement is designed to align capacity more closely with our perception of ongoing demand, improve our structural cost and move our spec towards our business model gross margin range of 18% to 23%. The hard drive is a high technology commodity. The critical factors for success in this market are consistent high quality and reliability, large scale and low cost, focused asset management, effective technology deployment, product's breadth, and product availability. WD's consistent and profitable growth over the last seven years demonstrates our understanding of these key factors. And our ability to deliver industry-leading performance across all of them, while executing within the financial model I outlined earlier. We are focused on continuing to deliver outstanding customer value through consistent execution against this simple yet effective model. Operating expense averaging 10% of revenue over the last five years has enabled expansion of our worldwide sales and support operations, which has extended our ability to bring outstanding products to customers in every corner of the globe. It has funded the development of industry leading component technologies in heads and media to underpin our customer value proposition. And it has allowed us to develop a broad and diversified product portfolio serving the majority of the available ATA hard drive and external storage markets, while also funding significant engineering activity in preparation for our entry into the traditional enterprise market. We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of these controlled and focused investments through the technology deployments and product shipments we have announced since our last conference call. In the December quarter, we believe that we shipped more 500 gigabyte, 2.5 inch hard drives than all five of our competitors combined and shipped twice as many as our nearest competitor. We brought the fundamental technology and system design to market at roughly the same time as key competitors. However, it is the entire recipe of our approach to new product introduction and ramp that is evident in this level of market acceptance and our financial results. The ingredients include our process technology and new product deployment and our refinement of yield, utilization, cost and supply chain logistics as we ramp into production, all the while maintaining the industry's leading quality and reliability metrics and lowest warranty expense. This week, we began volume shipment of another industry-first, the 2-terabyte WD Caviar Green 3.5-inch hard drive, employing our advanced 400 gigabit per square inch aerial density technology allied to our unique second-generation WD GreenPower energy-saving technology. This same 2-terabyte drive will also power a new capacity point in our My Book line of personal storage products and enables an 8-terabyte capacity in our WD ShareSpace enhanced product line for home server, media center and small business applications. In our branded group, we launched several new Mac products during the quarter, including the My Passport Studio with FireWire 800 connectivity, the My Passport for Mac in 320-gigabyte and 500-gigabyte capacities and the My Book Mac edition at 1 terabyte. We also entered an entirely new branded product category with the launch of the WD TV HD Media Player, a device that allows easy playback from any USB storage device of music, photos and video directly on to televisions in full 1080p HD format. This is the first in a line of WD branded products designed to bring users' media content out of the home office and into the family room with a simple and elegant PC-free interface. Tim Leyden will now provide our detailed report on the December quarter, our resizing and our outlook. Tim?
Tim Leyden: As John described, unprecedented macroeconomic conditions made the December quarter a challenging one for WD and the entire hard drive industry. Nevertheless, in the face of these challenges, the WD team took swift action to reduce expenses, cut production capacity and minimize working capital investments. As we enter the quarter, we have expected sequential quarterly unit growth of about 5%, at the low end of historical seasonal trends. Instead, we had to make course corrections during the quarter to respond to a decline in our total served market unit demand of approximately 14%, and desktop and notebook markets each declined about the same percentage. Our revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $1.8 billion, down 17% from the prior year. Hard drive revenue is down 13% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Shipments totaled 35.5 million units, up 4% from the prior year, but down 10% sequentially. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51, down $2 from the September quarter and $10 from the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 ASP reflects a very competitive pricing environment as a result of all competitors having anticipated more robust demand and consequently having too much supply available for the demand that materialized. For the December quarter, we saw sequential declines in desktop, notebook and enterprise data unit shipments. We experienced the first Q1 to Q2 decline in 2.5-inch drive market demand since entering the notebook market in September 2004. Our unit shipments of 2.5-inch drives were 13.8 million in the December quarter as compared to 14.6 in the September quarter and 8.7 million in the year-ago quarter. On the plus side, shipments of consumer electronics and branded products were up sequentially. We shipped 4.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the December quarter as compared to 3.9 in the September quarter and 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. And revenue from sales of branded products increased 5% from Q1 and 10% from the year-ago quarter to $403 million. Hard drive channel revenue was 57% OEM, 21% distribution and 22% branded products in the December quarter compared with 56%, 26% and 18% in the September quarter and 48%, 34% and 18% in the year-ago quarter respectively. There was one customer, namely Dell, which comprised more than 10% of total revenue. The Q2 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 23% Americas, 29% Europe and 48% Asia as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the September quarter and 32%,32% and 36% in the year-ago quarter. Demand strength in Asia continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region. Our gross margin for the quarter was 15.9% versus 20.1% in the September quarter and 23.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our December gross margin was impacted by the decline in overall market demand and the resulting competitive pricing pressures and factory under utilization. Our media operations continue to perform as expected. And we have achieved the 300 basis point cost saving objective outlined at the time of our acquisition. Total operating expense of $274 million included $113 million of charges associated with the restructuring plan announced on December 17. Excluding these restructuring charges, total on R&D and SG&A was $161 million for the December quarter, $29 million less than the September quarter. Our quarterly operating expense benefited from the reversal of variable compensation incentives amounting to $16 million that had been accrued in the September quarter and the absence of similar accruals in the December quarter and a $6 million insurance recovery. Our resizing plan includes the closure of one of our hard drive manufacturing facilities in Thailand; one of our substrate manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and headcount reductions throughout the world. We expect the plan to be implemented by the end of March, 2009. Planned headcount reductions are about 7%, combined with attrition of 6%, should result in total headcount reduction of about 6500 by the end of March. And combined with work hour reductions of about 7%, the result should be about a 20% reduction in total capacity. The total cost of the restructuring is currently expected to be approximately $140 million, $113 million of which has been recorded in operating expenses for the December quarter. The total cash utilized by the resizing actions is expected to be approximately $60 million, most of which will be spent in the March quarter. There were no material cash expenditures related to the restructuring in the December quarter, annual savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $150 million. Operating income was $16 million or 0.9% of revenue, including the $113 million restructuring charge. Excluding the restructuring charge, operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $129 million or 7.1% of revenue. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $9 million. This includes about $6 million of unrealized losses on our previously-disclosed investments in auction-rate securities. These investments totaled $19 million at the end of the quarter. The company recorded a net tax benefit from the December quarter of $7 million. This consists of a tax provision of $6 million offset by a $6 million tax benefit related to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was enacted into law in October 2008 and a $7 million favorable adjustment of previously recorded tax accruals to reflect the change in the company's outlook for future income before taxes. Net income totaled $14 million, or $0.06 per share, excluding the $113 million restructuring charge and the related tax benefit of $4 million, non-GAAP net income was $123 million or $0.55 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter totaled $1.4 billion as compared to $1.2 billion at the end of September. We generated $300 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $140 million and our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $122 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be about $500 million. This is consistent with the update we gave on December 17, when we announced the significant reduction from our prior forecast of $750 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $480 million. We did not repurchase any shares of stock during the December quarter. We believe that in times of economic uncertainty and tightness of credit, the robust cash balance is an important strength. We will continue to manage our cash accordingly during these certain economic times. As of the end of December we had 46 days of receivables outstanding, 27 days of inventory or 14 turns and 64 days of payables. This resulted in a cash conversion cycle of 9 days. In accordance with the accounting rules prescribed by FAS 142, we reviewed the value of our goodwill and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of quarter end. This review must be done annually or whenever events or changes and circumstances indicate that goodwill maybe impaired. It is possible that an impairment charge under the FAS 142 rules will occur in future quarters. Before I discuss the March quarter, I would like to make a few comments about our stated business model. As John indicated, we continue to believe that an 18% to 23% gross margin model is appropriate given our level of vertical integration, the amount of investments in capital and R&D required continuing to provide the products demanded in the market place and to generate an appropriate return for our shareholders. As outlined in the restructuring plan, we have resized our cost structure with the objective of remaining profitable and cash flow positive at a $1.5 billion quarterly revenue run rate. The critical remaining pieces of the equation are balanced supply-demand environment and a product and segment mix that will support the revenue level commensurate with the value we are delivering. I want to once again remind you that WD will have a 14-week quarter in this fiscal year, and we will include that extra week in our fourth fiscal quarter that will end on July 3rd, 2009. Now I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2009. First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. Historically, the March quarter's sequential unit decline has been in the range of 0 to minus 8%. Global macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and the outlook in our industry and the PC industry narrows that. With demand visibility continuing to be limited, credits continuing to be tight for our customers and inventory rationalization continuing throughout all channels, we envisage that these conditions will continue to render historical demand patterns less meaningful through the rest of this calendar year. As a result, we are modeling a quarter-on-quarter sequential market unit reduction of approximately 13%. We believe that in a commodity marketplace such as ours, this balancing of supply and demand continues to be critical, and we are still seeking to find that equilibrium as an industry. So we anticipate that pricing will continue to be competitive. The capacity realignments undertaken by the 3.5-inch industry participants has led to a better balance between supply, demand and inventory holding pattern. However, in the 2.5-inch segment, the willingness of multiple competitors to operate unprofitably continues to depress prices to a level that is insufficient to sustain investment. In the branded products area, competition has intensified as competitors gravitate towards more attractive margins than those provided by comparable products in other segments. Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in the range from $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. For comparative purposes, you should note that our fiscal Q3 revenue numbers last year included $89 million of revenue for external media sales as we fulfilled Komag's pre-acquisition and contractual obligations. We are modeling gross margin in a range from 14% to 14.5%. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $175 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $4 million. We anticipate tax expense of between $5 million and $10 million for the March quarter. We anticipate our share count to be approximately flat with the December quarter. These amounts exclude remaining restructuring charges which we estimate to be about $27 million. This estimate may change until the date of actual disposal or completion of the restructuring plan. GAAP EPS including the restructuring charges is therefore expected to be between a loss of $0.11 and a profit of $0.02 for the March quarter. Excluding the restructuring charges, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.01 and $.14. The non-GAAP earnings per share are calculated using the same share count as the GAAP earnings per share. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I had two questions if I could. The first, Tim, for you, the $150 savings that you identified in annual savings, could you just give us a little flavor about how and when that shows up, how that unfolds? And then, particularly, how we should be thinking about COGS versus OpEx? And then I have a follow up. Thanks.
Tim Leyden: Yes, we anticipate that we will be at that run rate from the 1st of April and so consequently move right through the June quarter. And we'd be at that new run rate. And then on COGS versus OpEx if we look at the $150 million savings, it's about two-to-one.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Two-to-one.
Tim Leyden: Yes, two-to-one, OpEx versus COGS. Now please remember that in the June quarter, it's a 14-week quarter for us.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Right, fair enough. Okay. Thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up is: you have identified how much capacity that you anticipate taking out of your system? I just wonder, through your industry analysis, how much you think the industry is looking to take out of total capacity.
John Coyne: I think, Keith, as we indicated, we saw the industry demand come down by some 13%, 14% on a quarter-over-quarter basis into the December quarter. And we are modeling industry demand to go down another 13% into the March quarter. Now we are talking at ATA 3.5 and 2.5 inch combined, and our view would be that the capacity should come down by the same amount that the demand is predicted to be down if we desire to achieve that supply demand balance which is so critical to the health of this industry.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Right, fair enough. Okay. Thanks, guys, I see.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with Calyon. Your line is open.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: Yes, thank you very much. I just want to make sure I understand this math correctly, because your headcount was reduced by 500 and something sequentially already, you targeted 2500 or so. So, I think you have 80% more to go in terms of the headcount target. Should we think about 80% of $150 million divided by four as the quarterly difference between the OpEx in the December quarter and where you going to be at the end of June?
Tim Leyden: Shebly, I am not sure that I understand the question and can you please --.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: You have already reduced your headcount by 20%, I'm sorry, by 20% of the target, right? You want to reduce your headcount by 2500 and you have reduced it by 500 already, correct?
Tim Leyden: Yes.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: Okay, so the $150 million annual savings, 80% of that is left, so to speak, if I look at the headcount side. And then you have divided by four. I was just trying to figure out what kind of OpEx number I should be thinking about in the September quarter of this year?
Tim Leyden: Okay. What we've done is we've indicated that we are citing the business to run at $1.5 billion in revenues. And our business model for OpEx has been in the 9% to 10% region when we were operating at around 2 billion, little above 2 billion, and in revenue. So we've been operating somewhere in the $180 million to $190 million run rate from an OpEx view point. We are going to try and get back to, as John indicated in his remarks, get back to somewhere in the 9% to 11% range and it's probably ten more towards the 10% rather than 11%. We are going to try and see if we can keep it in at that level, so consequently when you do the math of that, it will be coming somewhere between a $155 million and $165 million.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: By the September quarter?
Tim Leyden: No, by the June quarter. We're going to be at that run rate from the 1st of April.
John Coyne: Well, that's a thirteen week run rate, yes.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: And ask one more?
Tim Leyden: Again there, Shebly, let me remind you that it's a fourteen week quarter in June.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: Yes.
John Coyne: So you have to flex for the fourteenth week.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: Should we think about the March quarter with this 14% or 14.5% gross margin as a low watermark and now we should think about getting back to an 18% gross margin by the end of this year. Is that reasonable kind of expectations?
Tim Leyden: Well, I mean, it's back to what John mentioned about, the critical factor in gross margin, and one of the factor and possibly the most critical factor is pricing. It depends on how the industry sizes itself to match the demand. If it sizes itself to match demand, then yes, it's possible to get back to a reasonable gross margins, but until that's done, we can't forecast when that is going to happen.
Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon: Thank you.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you and good afternoon, gentlemen. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in terms of channel conditions? Obviously, that segment is primarily 3.5 inch ATA, but it seems people have been acting a little better there. See if you could comment on that?
Tim Leyden: Yes, well that's what I indicated in my comments. We are seeing that the actions that have been taken by the participants and the 3.5 inch segment are tending to firm up the actual situation between inventory, supply and demand and we are beginning to see the firming up of pricing in that particular segment.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: There are a lot of indications that overall channel inventories, and even if you look at your own balance sheet and Seagate's balance sheet, the lowest levels I've certainly ever seen. Do you feel that now, after two quarters, I must say, we are down 13%, after two quarters with that type of decline, has the industry gone too far? Will too much capacity be coming offline or is the capacity that is coming offline, primarily 3.5 inch, and it kind of sets the stage for your expansion, more in the 2.5 inch in the second half?
John Coyne: Well, Rich, this is John. Visibility into demand still remains somewhat, okay and cloudy, but the way we're thinking about it, yes, there has been significant reduction in inventories in the channel, particularly in 3.5-inch. In WD's case, we have taken 1.2 million units out of the channel on a quarter-over-quarter basis end of December versus end of September. As you can see, with our 14 turns, we're managing our internal inventory in the way that we always manage it, very well matched to the demand. However, there are some elements of concern that I have. I look at our own restructuring plan, and one of the outcomes of that is that we have enough unutilized PCs in our business to last us for some considerable time into the future, because we have to let go the users of those PCs. We therefore are looking at all of the headcount reductions that are happening on a worldwide basis in multiple industries. We believe that those industries are going to have the same kind of condition, and therefore, we see a further depressed demand in the commercial segment as we look forward from a PC-demand perspective. And that's a commercial PC statement, both desktop and notebook. As we look at the consumer space, we think that's a little less affected. There is some cannibalization effect in the traditional notebook caused by the surging popularity of lower-priced netbook offerings. The good news for us there is that the vast majority of netbooks are shipping with hard drives. And one of WD's forte´ is design and manufacture of very cost effective solutions to any kind of client system hard drive. So, net-net, we think that that emergence of a lower price point with a reasonable functionality that relies on a hard drive to deliver that functionality is medium to long term a good thing for us and for demand in that segment. Then we look at the direct external sales of drives in the retail brand of products arena where we see the cleanest demand profile of all. Demand in that segment for us was good in the December quarter. We were modestly up. I think that's a reflection of our great products, great channel partnerships. And while we expect that to diminish somewhat seasonally as it has traditionally done, we believe inventories are very well managed and the demand profile there is immediately visible. And we can react to that.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Very helpful. I guess it's my last question. Just any thoughts on the potential Toshiba-Fujitsu merger and does this in anyway change your timing for the entrance into the enterprise?
John Coyne: Two answers: first, we have a long standing tradition of not commenting on rumor; and second, we continue with our investments in preparing to enter the enterprise space. And we will let you know when we are shipping product in that space.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank, your line is open.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thank you. Tim, I was just hoping you could go through the tax numbers again really quickly. I am just trying to understand what your normalized tax rate would be without the external, the extra external items. It seems like there was about 10 million of extra items that we won't see again. Just trying to get a number there.
Tim Leyden: Yes, our regular tax expense was $6 million during the course of the quarter.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. $6 million.
Tim Leyden: And we had the benefits of 30.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. $6 million. And then if I look at the mix of your business in the quarter, it looks like there is a lot of retail business. I can understand that from the perspective of the seasonality and the holiday sales. But I think some people would be concerned that maybe there is higher inventory levels in the retail channel. Can you maybe comment on the inventory levels in the branded products business and why that number jumped up so much?
Tim Leyden: Yes, I think our inventory levels in the branded products are very well in line with what we would normally expect; in fact, a little down on the prior quarter. So we're very comfortable with that.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Yes. Do those typically have higher inventory levels?
Tim Leyden: Yes. I think we've noted this on several of the calls, that the pipe there is a little longer than the traditional component distribution numbers. You're probably looking at components that at the end of this quarter were way down at the four-week level, or slightly below, and typically the retail pipeline runs in the eight to nine weeks. I think it is at the low end of that.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners, your line is open.
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks. Can you comments on pricing trend; in the last three weeks specifically?
Tim Leyden: As we indicated, again that the 3.5 inch has begun to show some signs, the beginnings of some elements are firming up, and 2.5 continues to be extremely competitive. And again, as I noted in my comments, we are seeing competition intensify also in the branded product area.
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. And then I'm wondering if you can give a little more color, where the cuts have been made within SG&A and how quickly you can restore resources you have let go of in the event, or rather when, a recovery happens?
Tim Leyden: Cuts have been made pretty much right across the OpEx and manufacturing areas and in the OpEx area we are dealing with it by cutting out activities and trying to stem down the number of our transactions and activities that people do. And we are able to operate efficiency at the current level and when we see the signs of more visibility and demand clarity coming back. We would be able to resume normal hiring type of activity. If you review our progress over the last five years, responding to upside opportunity has never been a problem for us.
Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners: Great, thank you.
Operator: Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital, your line is open.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Great, thank you, good quarter. My question, what is your capacity then, when you get done with this? Can you share with us, what your total quarterly manufacturing capacity would be?
John Coyne: It will be whatever the market demands from us.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: I thought you said earlier, you'd have a total of a 20% reduction in your total capacity?
John Coyne: That's what we're sizing to support, as Tim mentioned, the focus of our resizing plans was to be appropriately sized to be profitable and cash positive at a $1.5 billion revenue run rate. Now, around that model target for the baseline of the model, again we have a fundamental business model that is quite flexible around the center line. So what we've done in the restructuring is to take our center line from 2 billion down to the 1.5 billion and then what we will do on a operational tactical basis from week-to-week as we closely monitor demand and market activity, is to respond to that appropriately. Whether that's up or down around that median line and that's how we typically run our business. If you look at what's different today than this time last year, I'd have to say that we're being a little more conservative and tending to be in a posture of chasing opportunity up once we've verified it, rather than getting in front of it.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Okay. That's fair. Can you make a comment on what you believe the capacity of the industry is today and where it may be a couple of quarters from now, and the aggregate quarterly volume? Seagate believes the industry, actually in December, before all the restructuring, was about a 160 million units a quarter, which you agree or disagree with that number and where do you think it's headed?
John Coyne: Yes. I think that number is the total industry number; our focus since we participate in the ATA segment, 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch ATA segment tends to be on that segment, which was 131 in September, 113 in December and we are modeling at about a 100 in the March quarter. And so we are looking at our opportunity in that light and in our sizing maintaining our share in light of those expectations for market sides.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Great, one last question if I may? I'm not going to comment on the rumor, if Toshiba and Fujitsu were to ever happen, but, what do you believe would be the impact to you in the industry if such a merger occurred?
John Coyne: I think we are more focused on how we delight customers with great products that are of high quality and reliability, address their needs, and are available at the right times and frankly, the health of the industry as we see it, relates to how the supply demand balance is managed from a build perspective. And the health of our company is derived from how much better we execute than our competitors.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Great. Thank you. No further questions.
Operator: David Bailey with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. Just in follow-up to a comment that you made earlier. How are you thinking about your mix and pricing within product lines this year in light of the shift to lower-end desktops and notebooks as well as sort of the emergence of netbooks? I mean, it definitely helps on the unit side, but doesn't this put more pricing pressure?
John Coyne: It potentially would put some depending on how netbooks get on through the rest of 2009 relative to other PCs and relative to the other products of the market. Potentially, it's an outcome of mixing down the overall average gigabyte shift. And as I mentioned, one of WD's forte´ is the design and manufacture of a very cost effective product. And so here we see that as an opportunity. Now it does put some pressure on ASPs, but on the other side of that equation, offsetting that is that the branded product retail business is moving in the opposite direction. So, as fast as the PC price point is being moved down to make it accessible to more people, the need for storage doesn't change in the use case for the customer. And so we expect that the attach rate of external storage to those minimally-serviced products with low-end storage devices, we see that the opportunity to attach to those with high-capacity external storage is greater than the opportunity to attach to high-capacity full-featured PCs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan, your line is open.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions: More of a technology question; John, just given the macro backdrop and how you talked earlier about the oversupply of even PC, within your own environment, to the corporate PC, as happened to be quite depressible to the consumer, can we see something similar in the enterprise storage environment, where folks decide to shift more to a lower cost solution, such as SATA, a lot quicker than, maybe, a lot of us had anticipated, and move away from fiber channel over the next 12 to 18 months? How do feel positioned there if that was to occur?
John Coyne: Yes, I mean certainly SATA and the enterprise has been an area of significant success for us. It's an area that's been continually growing over the last several years as CIOs and their CEOs and CFOs began to focus more on the value proposition on how to service storage needs with properly-tiered cost solutions relative to performance. And that process has been going on for several years now. I think current economic environment accelerates more cost effective solutions and typically tiered storage that uses significant levels of enterprise SATA rather than using more expensive SAS SCSI fiber channel drives which typically are higher-price, lower-capacity, because they are primarily a performance device. Yes, I think we're going to see an acceleration of that deployment of lower-cost drives into the enterprise.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: And, as a follow-up, if that acceleration does occur, would WD need to spend any more on R&D to really flush out or bolster your SATA platform or you are already there and ready to go?
John Coyne: We're very happy with our positioning in that market.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just lastly, I know it's kind of an old type of practice from the old days, but “bundling”; has there been any sort of bundling we're trying, to kind of secure business with some of the OEMs now, where you're trying to package both desktop and the notebook and maybe a low-end server drive?
John Coyne: I think the trends that you are seeing in the industry, and I think on an overall basis, the top three suppliers represented 77% of the industry in the December quarter compared with 73.5% in the September quarter. But I think what you are seeing is a reflection of the value proposition that the large vertically-integrated broad product line companies offer to the customers in terms of value for money, technology roadmap, long-term capability to support their products and satisfy need on into the future. And so, I think that's going to continue.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Thank you.
Operator: Scott Craig with Banc of America, your line is open.
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Hi, good afternoon. Tim, can you take a look at the gross margins on a quarter-over-quarter basis and just kind of break out how much of the sequential decline was due to, say, pricing versus volumes versus anything else that you might want it from there? And then, John, from a 2.5-inch notebook perspective, I think you threw out some numbers there. You had more shipments than outside competitors to your nearest competitor, et cetera. So, what do you estimate your market share was in 2.5-inch from the December quarter? Thanks.
Tim Leyden: Okay. So, on a quarter-to-quarter pricing and margin movement, obviously pricing was by far the largest component. We once again for the fourth consecutive quarter saw prices that were higher than we had seen in comparable quarters.
John Coyne: Tim, sorry. Price decline?
Tim Leyden: Price decline; yes, in a comparable quarter. And the absorption, obviously, as we had to do with much lesser product volumes, was also a significant item and against that we had improvement in mix because our brand had improved from 18% to 22%. So pricing was the biggest item, and the utilization was the second biggest item we had some offsetting benefits from mix. And to the notebook question, the 2.5 inch product line, my reference related to the 400 gigabyte and 500 gigabyte capacity point and that ability to rapidly ramp reliably in that space and the customer acceptance of our ability to do that, overall, that have the effect, we think, we gained about two points of share in the notebook market.
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Kevin Rottinghaus with Cleveland Research, your line is open.
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Thanks. The 13% decline this quarter that you are seeing for the industry. How much that you think is demand is versus inventory?
John Coyne: Still quite hard to separate that, taking on informed stab, probably two-thirds demand, one-third inventory sweeps.
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Okay. And you've said kind of your inventory at least in the channel and at the retail level you think is okay. Is the inventory correction really just happening at the OEM level or do you think it's just other people in the industry that are kind of seeing an inventory correction happen?
John Coyne: I think it's throughout all channels and it's been driven by a number of things. As the demand ratchets down, the inventory that was appropriate last quarter is no longer appropriate, you need to bring the inventory down and concert with the demand reduction. So that's one item. The second item is credit availability where customers are looking to squeeze their inventory and turn those sales into cash and use the cash to pay down credit lines or to postpone that cash for the future in fear that they won't be able to renew credit lines and so on. So there is some impact of those behaviors, also on people changing their business models to run with lighter inventory that, in terms of weeks of inventory, than they would have in the past.
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Okay, for WDR, are you planning any manufacturing shutdowns this quarter?
John Coyne: We think we're sized to our own opportunity within the market, but we review this on a week-by-week basis as we map our demand profile against our production and our inventory levels and we manage all that on an ongoing basis, at this point, it's too early in the quarter to determine.
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Okay, and then just one last question. On the 3.5 inch side, is the pricing stabilizing? Do you think that's any indication at all of distress from some of your competitors not being able to go there on price any more? What do you attribute the 3.5 inch kind of price stabilizing here in near-term too?
John Coyne: I think it's a reflection of a more mature market with a smaller supply base. And so the visibility into the demand is a little more predictable and the reaction to that, given that there is a smaller group of people trying to interpret that demand, signals tend to be better. And I think you see in that market, the predominance of that market supplied by three suppliers, the Seagate, ourselves, and Hitachi, so again, that kind of narrows an improved visibility. And then, there certainly are indications that there is significant stress in that market place from a price versus cost perspective. And so the behavior we are seeing is to be expected.
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Thank you very much, appreciate that.
Operator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks good, afternoon. What do you think your market share is now of notebooks? And as volumes have accelerated over the last couple of quarters, are the gross margin percentages of those lower capacity drive converging towards more mainframe capacities?
John Coyne: I think we have a representative share in that segment relative to our share in other segments. And it is a challenge right now from the margin perspective, because we have not yet developed a purpose design solution for that segment.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And does that relate to the planning around $1.5 billion of revenue? Is the model two quarters out to be back to a normalized margin off of $1.5 billion or to just be at least slightly profitable?
John Coyne: Couple of quarters down, we do not anticipate that economic conditions will have returned to normal. So we'll continue to operate, to model for, and to match the demand. And that again is the key factor. I mean, we need to size our business in order to be able to deal with the market conditions. And it's important that that's understood throughout the industry, because that really is the most critical component in the gross margin equation followed pretty closely by segment mix also.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Got you. Thanks.
Operator: Joel Inman with Robert W. Baird, your line is open.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Hi. Thanks. Nice job on the quarter. So your OpEx guidance, did you say $175 million next quarter?
Tim Leyden: Yes, for OpEx.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: And what's the reason that's going up?
John Coyne: 14 weeks.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: All right. Okay.
John Coyne: Q3, it's 175 million. And the reason that's going up relative to Q2, Tim, did call out that a component of the Q2 reduction quarter-to-quarter was a reversal of a bonus accrual from the September quarter.
Tim Leyden: Right. And so, we don't have that pickup in the March quarter. And that was, what, $16 million?
John Coyne: $16 million.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then on the branded side of the business, how do you describe the competitive landscape there? I know you said it's intensifying. But as it pertains to third-party suppliers that don't actually manufacture the products, do you see some consolidation in that space in the near term?
John Coyne: Our observation is that things are becoming more competitive in that space. That will certainly put some pressure on people with marginal structures and marginal market access and so on. We believe we've got a great product line. We've got customer relationships, and we have a very good product roadmap. So we're very enthused about that market and we're very committed to continue to prosecute that market as the leaders. And we're working on that as we speak.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just the new product that you announced, is that available today?
John Coyne: Yes. That's been available since mid to end of September, and we're very pleased with the acceptance level on that product and we are very pleased with the excitement it's creating and the demand for incremental storage that that's creating, because it provides a very simple and elegant, straightforward mechanism to take drive content directly to the TV.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks very much.
John Coyne: Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne.
John Coyne: Thanks, Holly. In closing, I want to thank the entire WD team. I am greatly appreciative of the loyalty and commitment to WD's success displayed by all of our employees as we resize our business, those who are, unfortunately, leaving us and those who are staying with reduced compensation packages. Their integrity and class, their sustained focus, commitment to success and outstanding execution in these trying times is truly inspiring. Our results in such challenging market conditions are a testament to their capability and tenacity. Despite the current state of the economy, we remain very encouraged by the long-term market opportunities for high-capacity storage in the years ahead. The applications driving the digitization of massive content are not going away. We are taking what we believe are prudent and appropriate steps to size our business for the new economic environment we expect throughout calendar 2009. We remain committed to provide the best customer value proposition in the industry to deliver financial results which allow us to make the substantial investments required to continue to lead the industry and providing solutions to customer needs for high capacity, cost effective storage and to generate superior returns for our supply partners, our employees, the communities in which we operate and our shareholders. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

I would like to turn the call over to President and CEO, John Coyne.
John Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that WD again delivered solid, profitable growth in the first quarter, in an environment of subdued demand.  Looking at the WD served markets for 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch ATA hard drives in the September quarter, and including the Seagate's 14th week. The market grew 15%, both year-on-year and sequentially.  However, we believe that a comparison based on 13 weeks is more useful, in trying to understand the impact of current macroeconomic conditions on seasonal market demand.  On a 13 week basis, our served markets grew by 10%, both sequentially and year-over-year to 131 million units. While this is substantially below the average 20% year-on-year growth rate of the last three years, it is worth noting that HDD storage remains one of the few markets overall, that is demonstrating significant year-over-year growth in the face of current macroeconomic conditions.  The 2.5-inch market continues to grow strongly, up 37% year-on-year, and 22% sequentially to 61 million units. The 3.5-inch market contracted by 7% year-on-year, but grew 2% sequentially to 69 million units.  In this environment, WD continued to out-perform the market. Our unit sales for the quarter were up 34% year-on-year and 12% sequentially to 39.4 million units. We grew 2.5-inch shipments by 147% year-on-year and 25% sequentially to 14.6 million units.  We grew our 3.5-inch shipments 6%, both year-on-year and sequentially to $24.8 million. WD's hard drive revenue was up 22% year-on-year and 7% sequentially at $2.1 billion.  By presenting customers with a compelling product set, being selective in product market mix, being responsive in availability, and by maintaining focus on quality, efficiency, cost and execution, we again grew profitably in Q1, demonstrating the strength of the WD model and the WD team's discipline and execution.  In challenging conditions, we delivered gross margins in excess of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points year-on-year, controlled, operating expense to 9% of revenue, and generated earnings per share of $0.93.  Continued close attention to working capital management produced inventory turns of 14, and generated an ending cash balance of $1.2 billion.  Finished goods inventory was maintained flat as a percent of sales, both year-on-year and sequentially; while we controlled inventory in the component distribution channel in the low end of the normal four to six week range.  We continue to realize returns on our ongoing targeted R&D investments, with several important new technology and new product shipments in the first quarter including, the second generation WD Caviar Green hard drives, which significantly improved power, efficiency and performance.  The WD ShareSpace high-speed network storage system that provides cost-effective centralized storage of up to 4 terabytes for small office and home networks, and expanded Enterprise product line with the addition of high-capacity, high-performance, WD RE3 750 gigabyte and one terabyte 3.5-inch SATA hard drives. The new 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch backplane-compatible WD VelociRapto hard drives; the latest additions to the companies 10,000 RPM SATA drive series. The WD Scorpio Blue 2.5-inch notebook hard drive family, with capacities up to 500 gigabytes and 250 gigabytes per platter; extending our leadership position and delivering the industry's most advanced aerial density products in mass production today. Off the same platform, we also introduced the 500 gigabyte My Passport portable USB drives for easy storage and portability of music, videos, photos and data files.  Our strategic initiative to focus on the 2.5-inch business is enabling us to participate strongly in this; the fastest growing market segment for hard drives. These range from high-performance and mainstream notebook PCs, to external storage devices, to the emerging notebook market, an incremental opportunity for hard drives. We continue to assess the appropriate timing to extend our 2.5-inch expertise and value proposition to the gaming market.  Now, let me briefly address our view of the hard drive industry in the context of the current macroeconomic environment. The deterioration in the economy has led to a slowdown in both business and consumer spending. Most noticeably in big ticket items such as housing and automobiles, but to a lesser degree as we look at products with significantly lower price points. We have seen dampening of demand in the September quarter, and expect conditions of subdued demand to continue into the fourth quarter, the industry's traditionally strongest season.  At this point in the quarter we have limited visibility, as customers are unwilling to commit to the usual demand profile early in the quarter, as they focus on reducing inventories and preserving cash in light of broad concerns on both demand and credit availability.  Having said this, the WD business model is very adaptable, due to our focus on high-velocity and low cost. We watch demand very closely in each of our markets and adapt accordingly. When we see pockets of weakness, we have the ability to shift focus and adjust, build plans and mix quickly. We continue to plan strategically for the long-term and optimize tactically in response to short-term conditions. Accordingly, we have already lowered our build plans to meet an adjusted demand profile for the December quarter, to ensure that we don't build unnecessary inventory, as we enter the seasonally slower first half of calendar 2009.  If demand exceeds our expectations in the weeks ahead, we will chase that volume and do our best to meet customer requirements. Thus far in the quarter, the overall industry build seems well aligned with demand.  Tim Leyden will now provide our detailed report on the September quarter and review our outlook for the second fiscal quarter. Tim?
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. The WD team once again delivered strong results in the September quarter, as we continue to pay attention to the business fundamentals of supply-demand balance, cost management, fixed asset efficiency and conservative cash and working capital management.  The macroeconomic conditions during the quarter resulted in a more subdued growth up-tick in September from what we have seen in previous years. Revenue for our first fiscal quarter was $2.1 billion, up 19% from the prior year; hard drive revenue was up 22% from the prior year and 7% sequentially, and hard drive shipments totaled 39.4 million units, up 34% from the prior year and 12% sequentially.  Average hard drives selling price was approximately $53, down $3 from the June quarter and $6 from the year ago quarter. Our Q1 ASP reflects the ready availability of comparable products from most competitors across the entire product range, compounded by the continuing competitive pricing environment.  We shipped 14.6 million 2.5-inch drives in the September quarter, as compared to 11.7 million in the June quarter, and 5.9 million in the year ago quarter. These increases were driven by continued strength in notebook PC and external storage demand.  In consumer electronics, we shipped 3.9 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the September (inaudible), 4.1 million in the June quarter, and 3.7 million in the year ago quarter.  Sequentially, desktop showed sustained growth, branded revenues were essentially flat, and sales of our enterprise products were inline with our expectation.  Hard drive channel revenue was 56% OEM, 26 % distribution, and 18% branded products in the September quarter, compared with 57%, 24% and 19% in the June quarter, and 50%, 31% and 19% in the year ago quarter respectively.  There was one customer namely Dell, that comprised more than 10% of total revenue. The Q4 geographic breakdown of our hard drive revenue is 22% Americas, 29% Europe, and 48% Asia. As compared to 29%, 25% and 46% in the June quarter, and 34%, 33%, and 33% in the year ago quarter.  Our continuing strength in Asia is driven by our increasing 2.5-inch shipment. And though this is the region where the product is requested and integrated by our customers, many of these drives are incorporated in computer products that are marketed and sold in other regions. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 20.1% versus 21.3% in the June quarter, and 18% in the year ago quarter. This gross margin was achieved, despite the competitive pricing, through excellent team execution of improvements in cost, resource utilization and product mix, together with increased volume. Our media operation continues to perform in line with our expectation, and we are on track to achieve the 300 basis points cost improvement that we anticipated by the end of the December quarter. Operating expenses totaled $190 million or 9% of revenue, up slightly from the June quarter. As a result of increased R&D spending. As compared to the prior year, R&D expenses are higher due to the integration media operation and the addition of in-house hard disk controller and software development activities, as well as expansion of our new product and technology capabilities. SG&A increases reflect investments in our sales and marketing infrastructure, in support of our expanding product line and customer base. Prior year's operating expenses included $49 million of in-process R&D related to the acquisition of Komag.  Operating income was $234 million or 11.1% of revenue. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $4 million. This includes about $3 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments and option rate securities. These investments totaled $25 million at the end of the quarter.  Tax expense for the September quarter was $19 million or approximately 8% of income before taxes. For fiscal 2009, we expect our book effective tax rate to range between 7% and 10%, as we take into account our expected continuing profitability and the global mix of income by geographic location.  Fiscal 2009's cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2%. Our net income totaled $211 million or $0.93 per share. Turning to the balance sheet; our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter totaled $1.2 billion, as compared to $1.1 billion at the end of June. We generated $301 million in cash flow from operations during the September quarter.  Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $162 million, and our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $117 million. We now expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to be about $750 million, including about $150 million for our ongoing 8-inch wafer fab conversion.  This is down from the 800 million that we anticipated in our July call, as we take into account the uncertain demand environment. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $475 million.  We have repurchased 1.2 million shares of stock at a total cost of $35.6 million during the September quarter. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 17.8 million shares at a total cost of $284 million, for an average price of about $16 per share. A total of $466 million remains under our existing stock repurchase authorization. We believe that in times of economic uncertainty and tightness of credit, a robust cash balance is an important strength. Going forward, and against this background of prevailing market and credit conditions, we will be selective with our cash usage, as we weigh opportunities between growth of the current business, new market entries, strategic investments, share repurchases, and prepayments of the outstanding debt.  As of the end of September, we had 47 days of receivables outstanding, 26 days of inventory of 14 times and 66 days of payables. This resulted in the cash conversion cycle up seven days.  Before I address Q2 earnings guidance, I want to once again remind you that WD will have a 14 week quarter in this fiscal year, and we will include that extra week in our fourth fiscal quarter that will end on July 3rd, 2009. Now I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2009. First let me outline the market situation as we see it. Historically, the December quarter's sequential unit growth has been in the range of 6% to 9%.  However, in light of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, the tightening of credit worldwide, and the impact of Seagate's 14 week September quarter on current quarter demand, we are modeling on all modest expectations of market demand growth of approximately 5% for the December quarter. We also expect that average setting price on an absolute basis, will show some degradation contrary to historical trends. In addition, you should also note, that for year-on-year competitive purposes, our fiscal Q2 revenue numbers last year included approximately $120 million of revenue for external media sales, as we fulfilled Komag’s pre-acquisition contractual obligation. While we have continued our leadership in 2.5-inch hard drives, with the September launch of our 500 gigabyte WD Caviar Blue hard drives and My Passport mobile stores solution, most HDD competitors are in a position to provide other mainstream capacities across the entire 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch product lines in this quarter. Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be essentially flat quarter-to-quarter. Consequently, we are forecasting total revenues for the current quarter to be between $2.025 billion to $2.15 billion. We are [maddening] gross margins 19.3%. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $190 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $6 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be 7% of pre-tax income and our share count to be approximately flat with the September quarter. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.80 to $0.90 for the December quarter.  Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. (Operator Instructions). One moment please for the first question.  Our first question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Could you let us know which segments are the biggest drop in build plan versus your prior expectations for the December quarter?
Tim Leyden: David, I think we continue to project pretty robust demand for the 2.5-inch segment, and somewhat more subdued demand profile in the 3.5-inch areas.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: And then for the December quarter, actually on the CapEx side. Can you talk about your priorities for CapEx this year and whether you expect it to be more front-end and back-end loaded?
John Coyne: Our focus as far CapEx is concerned is to focus on flexibility, so that we can build what we need to build as close as possible to demand requirement. And we believe that that's a better choice rather than building inventory linearly in advance.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you. Good afternoon. First, when you look at your branded share relative to what the market's doing, can you comment on what you think the branded may do here in the December quarter and how you are positioning yourself for that?
John Coyne: Sure. We had a very good last quarter from a share and volume perspective. We grew significantly. We did grow rapidly in our 2.5-inch segment which accounts for the flat quarter-over-quarter revenue, which reflects the lower ASPs of 2.5-inch in general in that environment.  As we look forward into the coming quarter, we continue to see good traction in the external storage market. As I've said many times on these calls, we see this as one the under-appreciated areas for total storage demands, and so far it's exhibiting good strength in current macro environment.  
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Then when you were talking about inventories being closely managed, were you referring to this space or was it broader than that to OEMs?  
John Coyne: We are managing, but we've managed every piece of inventory, whether it's raw material, work in process or own finished goods, the level in the channel whether component or retail. We manage it all.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Secondly, on the overall plans, because you are now number one in notebook shares, I believe you are number one in retail as well. Where do you see, given the current environment, WD's greatest opportunities for growth over the next 12 months?  
John Coyne: Well I think, being number one in the two fastest growth market segment within the total industry is very good positioning, and continuing to rollout leadership products in those spaces, which we absolutely intend to do, and we currently have a very good position. I feel very good about that.  As we look at the rest of the current product portfolio, the fundamentals of the quality and availability and the high value low-cost capability that will give us strength in continuing to address those existing markets for which we have product lines.  We then have opportunity in unserved markets today; the traditional enterprise market which we’ve indicated that we are well along the process of investing in the underlying technologies and product portfolio to address that market in the future. We look at opportunity, as I mentioned in my remarks, we’re looking at the opportunity in the gaming market given our industry leading cost position. We see it as a competitive but attractive market space.  And likewise, in the netbook market as it unfolds is clearly demonstrating a preference for the incorporating of hard drives into those systems.  Probably when the dust settles through the December quarter, we’re probably going to be somewhere in the 70% to 80% netbook being shift with hard drives. And we see that also, as an attractive incremental market to our core markets.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Lastly, on the overall market. Do you think that the December quarter is the crossover point for when notebook HDDs are shipped more than desktop 3.5-inch, or do you think there is still enough branded consumption of 3.5-inch to last for a little bit?
John Coyne: It will be in the current fiscal year in my view. Whether it’s by the end of December, who knows? We don't much care; our fundamental investments in technology address all markets, our investments in manufacturing infrastructure and operations and supply base also are highly leveraged in terms of their ability to be used for either form factor. So, we are very comfortable about being able to respond to whatever rate of change there is as those volumes cross over.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you very much and well done.
John Coyne: Thanks.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with JPMC. Your line is open.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMC: Yes. Thank you. Good Afternoon. Two questions please. The first, can you just help us out. It's kind of a loaded question, but I am just trying to reconcile your comments relative to your peer's comments yesterday. When they said they stepped into the fog that they are concerned about the macro, but yet October is kind of seen or exhibiting its usual buzz, where as you are saying you have already seen subdued demand and weakness. Can you kind of just help us understand the puts and takes behind that?
John Coyne: Sure. In September, we saw demand not stepping up to meet the same level of seasonal up-tick that was typical of a September in a Q1. And that's probably the first large manifestation of the impact of the current macroeconomic environment.  We see that carrying over to a degree into October, and our expectations for outbound products, that people are managing their inventories more closely right throughout the chain.  People are recognizing that in these kind of environments cash is king, and utilizing their cash and their credit lines to support velocity rather than to support inventory is the right use of their resources.  Therefore, we are seeing lead times shortening, leaving the decision making on what to buy and when to buy it until they were looking at the demand side of that equation.  The numbers are still good; you've have seen our guidance, we are looking at flat revenues which implies volume increase. I think, Tim you said 5% on a sequential basis.  We are still expecting market growth, one of the few markets to exhibit growth in these times. So I don't think we are inconsistent at all with what Seagate would have said.  
Mark Moskowitz - JPMC: Okay, thank you. Secondly, they believe they have done a great job in terms of reflecting the operating model consistently with respect to the operating metrics.  I want to get a sense of how flexible you are if we do see a really subdued demand environment over the next couple of quarters. Clearly, some of the external suppliers out there are going some difficulties.  Would you be more apt to leverage TDK in terms of them being stuck in a position and to try to volume, or maybe you would source your head's more externally if you get some good price breaks there?  
John Coyne: I think the answer is more about how we closely manage inventories, and that’s not just in our own shop and in finished goods. That’s also looks backwards into the supply chains and the signal for getting in to the supply chain and the level which we are getting them dressed up to go to the party.  Therefore, we manage that entire supply chain footprint, both well and closely. I think our supply chain partners are all pretty much aligned with our plan, and our supply chain, because it’s routinely exercised along that model, tends to respond faster to the environment once they get our signals.  As to moving our sourcing model; no, we have a pretty well established, long term, strategic sourcing model that addresses particularly technology partners for the value they bring to us in assurance of execution on the introduction of new products and new aerial density points. That's the value they bring to our party. Our internal manufacturing brings the fundamental low cost value.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMC: Thank you.
Operator: Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group, your line is open.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Thanks. Our recent checks have suggested that Seagate, which has been very aggressive in pricing the last few quarters, became a little bit more reasonable with pricing towards the end of the September quarter, and so far in the quarter has continued to be a little bit more reasonable than they say they were, 10, 12 weeks ago. Would you say that you have seen that as well?
John Coyne: Current price level from the industry, we certainly have seen pretty significant takedowns over the last three quarters on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  There is the question of how long our competitors can continue to make such poor returns on their investments, by limiting those returns through very aggressive pricing.  I don't know the answer to that question. I do know that in the environment over the last three quarters and the environment we anticipate for the current quarter, Western Digital continues to deliver the kind of industry leading results that we have demonstrated today. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Fabulous. Could you give us any thoughts on all the rumors regarding consolidation in the industry and what your thoughts are?
John Coyne: Well, you know our long-standing policy is not to comment on such rumors. The history of the industry suggest that in times like these, where demand falls below the traditional demand curve for a period of time that pressure is put on the weaker participants and this tends to result in consolidation.  Again, we don't believe that consolidation is necessary. We make a very nice living in the business with the business model we've developed, but it could be beneficial.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: One last question. Just on the component side, and running very lean inventories I think in your prepared comments you said that you were running raw materials and components at very lean at four weeks versus six weeks. Did I hear that correctly?
John Coyne: Not quite. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Okay.
John Coyne: The commentary I made on inventory was that our finished goods inventory is flat both sequentially and year-over-year as a percent of sales, our channel inventories of the component distribution channel is in the low end of our four to six week range.  But if you take Tim’s commentary on overall inventory at 14 turns, we consistently carry the lowest inventory in the industry at the highest velocity, and therefore have the highest ability to respond to change and opportunity.
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Thank you.
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsch Bank. Your line is open.  
Sherri Scribner - Deutsch Bank: Hi, thank you. About the ASP decline this quarter. Could you maybe give a little bit of detail on where pricing was most aggressive? Was it again 2.5 inch which we've seen for a while or did you see pricing get more aggressive in 3.5-inch?  And as part of that in the December quarter, you mentioned that you would expect to see some degradation in ASPs. Would you expect similar levels down to 5% to 6% which we saw this quarter, and Seagate sort of suggested we see similar, but some color on that would also be helpful?
Tim Leyden: We saw competitive pricing right across the board. For the 3.5's a little more than 2.5's, and we anticipate that in the December quarter, because all competitors at this stage pretty much have ready availability almost right across the product lineup.  We expect that it will be competitive and again at the high-end of what we would normally see or above the high-end of what we would normally see in a December quarter.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsch Bank: Are you seeing a negative mix in your product profile in terms of drives that are addressing the network market, are you seeing a shift down? Also how is demand for high capacity drives right now?
Tim Leyden: Demand for high capacity is good. Certainly the network is kind of by definition a low capacity player, a lower (inaudible) context. The range of low capacities is from 80 to 160 gigabytes. And so, we are seeing a pretty good mix across the entire business.  As we've continued to grow the business, we’ve been mixing down, because of our initial strength in the very high capacities when we had them and nobody else could produce them.  So, as the other folks have come to the table, with the 250 gig capacity points and then the 320 gig capacity points, our overall mix has become more reflective of the total market demand.  Again, we anticipate that will richen up a little bit here as we go into the December quarter shifting the 500 gigabyte.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsch Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Scott Craig with Bank of America, your line is open.
Scott Craig - Bank of America : Thanks, good afternoon. With regards to the gross margin guidance for the December quarter, can you give us the pushes and pulls on it, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. How you see that playing out?  And then secondly, in the 2.5-inch notebook space, do you still feel that there are opportunities on a sequential basis over the next couple of quarters to gain share, or do you think you will be ceding share there as some of the other players have some more competitive products coming out in that space?
Tim Leyden: Okay. As far as the December, gross margin, the December quarter gross margin is concerned, and I think the big push will be on supply demand balance. Consequently, I think there is enough supply out there. People have comparable products across the range. So, we expect that there will be pretty competitive pricing.  We will combat that through cost and efficiency and utilization, and by being selective in how we approach the different pockets of weakness and pockets of strength. And so, we think it will be pretty much as it has been in the past.
Scott Craig - Bank of America : I think in your 2.5-inch question, the position there we believe share is a result of customer activity and how the customer perceive the value that we are offering. 
John Coyne: To date, our customers have been demonstrating that they are very happy with the value proposition that Western Digital brings, whether it be in high capacity drives, whether it be in availability on demand, superior quality, in our ability to continually reinvest in future technologies, future product breadth, significant high performance capacity and the development of the ongoing supply chain. These are all things that our customers look at in making the decision of where they place their business. Price is one element. But we believe we have a very strong portfolio, right across the board, but a particularly strong portfolio in the 2.5-inch environment where we have been very focused over the last five years in building our current position.  So, we would wait till the customers demonstrate the appeal of the value propositions.
Scott Craig - Bank of America : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes. Thank you. Can you help us reconcile the five point difference between your forecast of the market growth rate in the third quarter versus Seagate's. Because it doesn't seem like one week would make that big of a difference.  
Tim Leyden: That's a difference in growth rate. 
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Right.
Tim Leyden: If you run the numbers in our served market, which is 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch ATA drives, the 14 week number was 136 million, the 13 week number was 131 million off a base of a 119.  
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, got it. You think that anybody over shipped late in the quarter? The difference is just the one week?
Tim Leyden: Yes, I think the 13 week quarter profile was very traditional, very seasonal.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes.
Tim Leyden: But a little softer right the way through September, right, than traditional, but still a similar shape.  
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.  
Operator: Trey Lam with Integral Capital Partners. Your line is open. 
Trey Lam - Integral Capital Partners: Hi. First question has to do with Circuit City. Do you think that will have an impact on your December quarter, given the problems at Circuit City? And the second question I have is, have you seen an impact given your competitor sort of refresh their branded external products. Have you seen that impact My Passport and My Book biz.  
John Coyne: Okay. As far as commenting on the customer you called out. We don't comment on specific customers.  
Trey Lam - Integral Capital Partners: Will that have any impact on your business?
John Coyne: Well, theoretically, I mean when demand is demand and customers want the product, they will buy it wherever they can buy it. So it doesn’t really matter whether there are specific customers out there giving the products. There's demand for all product on an overall basis, so customer will demand that product wherever.
Trey Lam - Integral Capital Partners: Okay. 
John Coyne: And as far as the competition impact on brand is concerned, we've a very competitive lineup. We actually think it’s a very competitive space, and we believe that our product line up is broad and is capable of continuing to be deeply demanded by the customer.
Trey Lam - Integral Capital Partners: Okay. So really no impact so far yet?
John Coyne: That's correct. Not that we've seen.
Trey Lam - Integral Capital Partners: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Thanks. A couple of follow-up questions: On the CapEx side in particular, of the $600 million that’s not related to the wafer fab, is there any way we can break that down to understand better where the spending is going?  For example, are you assuming some level of market growth that you need to have capacity for in that or is that, what is maintenance CapEx now. Any granularity on what the 600 actually should be looked at as?
John Coyne: Yeah, we’ve been pretty specific about what our CapEx model is. It’s in the 7% of revenue region, and we are continuing to execute our business. We add capital on a just-in-time basis, and we take advantage of efficiencies when we see that there isn't a need to add further capital.  We continue as we have done for many years. We continue to take those efficiencies and cut our capital, as we see that there isn't a need for it.  So I think we are being conservative relative to the future, but it's more or less at this stage, its business as usual. Although we are, as I said, paying attention to being flexible with capital and the build more towards the customer needs.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, then lastly on growth into '09. Obviously not to give points of guidance or something, but 5% growth even if the market does do that is materially below any type of normal seasonality.  Does that change the dynamics for the March quarter as well in your mind? I mean do you think the usual approach of down and down again maybe is different or how should we be thinking about modeling this?
John Coyne: Well, at this stage we are operating with limited visibility, and we will have to see what happens in the balance of the December quarter, and then we will have to see what happens with inventory bills, and we'll have to see what Christmas is like.  And I don't think that there is any great visibility out there or anybody has any great visibility out there. What we are seeing as John mentioned is, that people are being cautious about showing their hand relative to their demand profile, and they are not giving us thorough forecasts as what they used to.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, thank you very much.
John Coyne: Okay I think we have no more questions. In closing, I want to thank the WD team, our employees, our supply partners for delivering another excellent quarter.  We remain very encouraged by the long-term market opportunities for profitable Western Digital growth in the years ahead, and are confident in our ability to continue to make the WD business model work effectively in all market environments.  I'd like to thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to keeping you informed about our progress.
Operator: Thank you. This does concludes today's conference you may disconnect at this time.

I’d now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital.
John F. Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining CFO Tim Leyden and myself today. Following my remarks, Tim will review our financial performance in fiscal year 2008 and our fourth quarter, and provide our outlook for the September quarter.  Fiscal ‘08 was an outstanding year for WD, capped off with a solid fourth quarter financial performance reported earlier today. For the year, we grew revenue 48% and earnings 54%, delivering on our primary goal of profitable growth.  We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations during the year. We also successfully concluded our $1 billion acquisition of Komag and have completed the integration of the new media operation and are already generating solid technology and cost contributions to the overall business.   Our fiscal ‘08 performance provides further evidence of disciplined operational and financial performance and the continued scalability and execution excellence of the  WD team.   Customer satisfaction with WD’s broad product line, high quality and reliability, service excellence, and overall value proposition continues to drive our business growth. We are very pleased with the continued, consistent performance of the efficient business model that we have built and refined over the last several years.  While maintaining focus in the high-volume desktop segment, we have made major strides in diversifying the business by establishing our footprint in newer, faster-growth markets such as the 2.5-inch notebook drives, branded products, consumer electronics, and SATA drives for the enterprise.  As a result of this activity in higher-growth areas, we saw our hard-drive revenues from non-desktop markets expand to 56% of revenue in fiscal ‘08, compared with 43% in fiscal ‘07 and 29% in fiscal ’06, and we exit the year with 63% of Q4 revenues derived from non-desktop, higher-growth applications.  It is worth noting that in the June quarter, WD was less reliant on the desktop business as a share of revenue and units than either Seagate or Samsung. Now, let me briefly address industry conditions as we ended the June quarter and enter the new fiscal year. My remarks are confined to the markets served by WD for 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch SATA and PATA hard drives. Despite concerns with macroeconomic conditions, June quarter industry demand was strong relative to seasonal patterns and expectations, coming in flat with the March quarter and increasing 19% year-over-year. 3.5-inch demand in the quarter was down 4% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year, in line with expectation. 2.5-inch demand was stronger than expected, up 7% sequentially and up a very healthy 45% year-over-year.  Strong year-on-year sales growth in Asia for the quarter reflected our success in the 2.5-inch notebook market, offsetting muted demand in the U.S. and Western Europe.  Industry shipments of 21.5 million units in the last week of the quarter represented 18% of total shipments in the quarter, an increase of half-a-week compared to the 14% shipped in the same week last year. This increase was likely due to the fact that certain hard drive companies ended their quarter on June 30th, a Monday this year but a Saturday last year, adding extra days of shipment opportunity. Industry inventories for manufacturers and distribution exiting the June quarter were down sequentially and compare favorably with the same time last year, up only 10% over last year while supporting a market which grew 19% year-over-year. This represents a reduction of one full week of supply on a year-over-year basis.  Manufacturers’ inventory reduced by some 4 million units sequentially and is at a little over one week of supply. Distribution inventory was also down some 700,000 units sequentially and is in the middle of the normal four- to six-week range.  Pricing in the distribution channel, which accounts for some 20% of the total hard drive revenue stream, is driven more than any other industry segment by short-term supply/demand dynamics. The desktop market is uniquely weighted towards distribution, with a roughly 50-50 split between distribution and OEM customers.  Distribution pricing was especially tough last quarter because of a competitor’s large inventory overhang exiting March, which led to the industry’s highest quarterly price erosion in the desktop distribution channel since 2001, at 16%.  While the inventory overhang was largely eliminated by June quarter-end and current inventory levels are in good shape, this price erosion had a spillover impact on OEM September quarter price negotiations, as well as creating a depressed distribution pricing floor entering the new quarter.  We navigated through these conditions reasonably well, helped by our lesser dependence on desktop business. We also leveraged our responsive manufacturing capability to adjust product and segment mix. We expect that the conditions created in the June quarter will have some residual impact on the industry and our business through the current quarter.  I would now like to describe the recent results of our multi-year diversification effort on a market-by-market basis and tell you why we think we are well-positioned to continue our profitable growth in the year ahead, primarily based on compelling products that are currently shipping.  Continued execution of our demonstrated product design and deployment capability is also important in driving the continued potential of the WD profitable growth story in future years. Looking at our individual markets, we tripled our 2.5-inch drive shipments year-over-year to 36.6 million units, demonstrating technology and product leadership throughout the year. Even with this success, we have yet to ship meaningful volume to three of the world's top 10 notebook OEMs, leaving significant growth opportunities in our mainstream 5400 RPM product line.  In June we began shipping our new line of WD Scorpio Black 7200 RPM 2.5-inch SATA hard drives in capacities up to 320 gigabytes for high performance notebook markets. This important product expansion offers our customers another opportunity to embrace the WD value proposition of quality, reliability and availability in the notebook segment.  We grew revenue in our branded products business by 60% year-over-year to $1.4 billion and we continue to add new products and product features to the line-up, to strengthen our leadership position and expand our available market.  In the June quarter, we completed the rollout of the popular My Passport Essential series with a refreshed design in multiple colors, and over the last several months we began shipping many new and next-generation branded products, including the My Passport Elite fully-featured portable USB hard drive in capacities of 320 and 250 gigabytes; the Mac-formatted My Passport Studio portable hard drive for Apple Mac users, targeting a discerning, fast-growing sub-segment of the branded business; the newest model of our 3.5-inch My Book series, the Mirror Edition dual drive storage system, which automatically stores content not once but twice to maximize safety and security of users’ valuable content; and a USB version of the WD My DVR Expander, significantly expanding the recording capacity of Dish Network HD DVRs. In Enterprise SATA, a fast-growing segment of enterprise storage, we continued to innovate with the introduction of our 3.5-inch SATA GreenPower drive series and the WD VelociRaptor drive family, the industry’s first 300-gigabyte 10,000 RPM 2.5-inch drive.  Over the last few years, the fastest growing segment in the mainstream enterprise market is 2.5-inch SAS drives for blade servers and storage. This market is now approaching 4 million units per quarter, with annual growth in excess of 40%. We expect the WD VelociRaptor 2.5-inch SATA products to establish a niche for SATA in this market, just as the 3.5-inch WD RE offerings did in the large form factor space, following their introduction in 2004.  The introduction of our power-saving technology to our WD AV hard drives for the CE space, combined with improved costs and our demonstrated field quality performance, have been the catalysts in helping us resume growth in this important segment, leading to enhanced value for our customers and improved contribution to WD’s business. To underpin our medium to longer term growth, we continue to work and invest to constantly roll out new platforms, capacities and features to timely meet the needs of our existing served market segments. We are also investing in the underlying technology to facilitate entry into our currently un-served market sectors of mainstream enterprise, gaming, and automotive. We continue to aspire to serve every segment of the mass storage market and will do so as these segments offer adequate return on the investments required to serve them properly. As is traditional with WD, we will announce all new products only when they are available and shipping in volume. Now I’d like to turn to the longer-term future. The global hard drive industry continues to present great opportunity for those with an appropriate business model. Storage demand and applications for hard drives continue to proliferate in both computing and consumer markets, as both workplace and lifestyle changes continue to generate increasing volumes of content to be stored securely, conveniently and cost effectively on hard drives.  The HDD market in fiscal ‘08 generated revenues in excess of $35 billion, with 540 million hard drives shipped, while forecasted demand for fiscal ‘09 exceeds 620 million units. On a unit basis, the overall hard drive market is looking at a five-year CAGR of approximately 13%, while those markets served by WD are forecast to grow in excess of 16% annually. We continue to see the strongest growth potential in the notebook PC and Branded Product segments, areas of continued focus for WD. We are encouraged by these opportunities for profitable growth, both for the near-term and as we head into the seasonally strong second-half of the calendar year, and as we address the longer-term prospects represented in these industry forecasts.  I’d like to highlight some of the important actions we’ve taken during fiscal ‘08 to ensure our continued success in addressing these outstanding market opportunities. We have made and continue to make investments in the technologies and infrastructure that will enhance our ability to compete as a full-line industry leader, with the product portfolio required to capitalize on these growth trends and the capacity and cost structure to do so efficiently and profitably. We added to our design and development capability with significant expansion of our technical workforce in Lake Forest and San Jose and in Asia, and the addition of a new design center in Longmont, Colorado. In June, in a further strategic step to accelerate our technology development and deployment, we acquired the hard drive controller IP rights, design tools, and design team from ST Microelectronics. This in-house HDC capability will enhance the efficiencies of our development process with our existing SOC supply partners.  Our previously announced plan to upgrade and expand our Fremont wafer facility is on track and we have already produced first wafers from our new 8-inch pilot line, ahead of schedule. As indicated earlier, the integration of media operations has greatly enhanced our technology capability and overall cost structure.  Tim will now review our financial performance and outlook. Tim.
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. Our fiscal 2008 and June quarter results demonstrate continued strong execution by the WD team. During the year, we improved and refined the basic WD business model in which we profitably satisfy our customers’ demands by efficiently providing a broad range of quality products at competitive costs.  In the seasonally softer June quarter, our results reflect our capability to thrive in a very competitive pricing environment. The growing segment and geographical diversification of our business provided us with the basis to generate strong results, despite the impact of the excess inventory which was carried into the quarter by our competition. This diversification resulted in continued strong revenue growth, operational results that delivered 630 basis points of gross margin improvement over the same quarter last year, and earnings that exceeded expectations.  For our full fiscal year 2008, total revenue was $8.1 billion, hard drive shipments were 133 million units, and hard-drive ASP was $59. The corresponding numbers in fiscal ‘07 were $5.5 billion, 96.5 million units and $57, respectively.  Gross margin in ‘08 was 21.5% versus 16.5% in ‘07.  Operating income for ‘08 was $1 billion versus $415 million in ’07, and net income for ‘08 was $867 million versus $564 million in ‘07.  Fiscal ‘08 EPS was $3.84 versus $2.50 in ‘07.  Net income in ‘08 included the impact of $75 million of tax charges related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries, and $49 million of acquired in-process R&D expenses, whereas ‘07’s net income included a favorable tax adjustment of $126 million related to the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Turning to the fourth quarter results, revenue was $2 billion, up 46% from the prior year, and hard drive shipments totaled 35.2 million units, up 41% from the prior year period.  Average hard drive selling price was approximately $56 per unit, down $3 from the March quarter but up $1 from the year-ago quarter. Our Q4 ASP reflects our response to the pricing environment created by the stress of the excess inventory liquidation push mentioned earlier, as well as expected seasonal pricing factors.  The percentage of our hard drive revenue generated by non-desktop applications was 63% in the June quarter, 54% in the March quarter, and 46% in the year-ago quarter. We shipped 11.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives in the June quarter, as compared to 10.2 million in the March quarter and 3.8 million in the year-ago quarter. These increases were driven by continued strength in notebook PCs, coupled with increased customer preference for WD product offerings as we also benefited from the recent refresh of our WD My Passport range of portable storage solutions for people on the move.  In consumer electronics, we shipped 4.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the June quarter, 3.1 million in the March quarter, and 2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The refined WD value proposition in this space is resonating with a broad set of discerning customers.  Sales of our enterprise products were in line with our expectations. On the desktop side, we increased the percentage of our business going to OEMs. Hard drive channel revenue was 57% OEM, 24% distribution, and 19% branded products in the June quarter, compared with 50%, 34%, and 16% in the March quarter; and 47%, 36%, and 17% in the year-ago quarter respectively. There were two customers, Dell and HP, that each comprised more than 10% of total revenue.  The Q4 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 29% Americas, 25% Europe, and 46% Asia, as compared to 28%, 31%, and 41% in the March quarter; and 40%, 26%, and 34% in the year-ago quarter.  Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 21.3% versus 22.6% in the March quarter, and 15% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin versus Q3 came primarily from the competitive 3.5-inch desktop channel pricing. We largely offset the normal seasonal pricing trends with a richer product mix, a changing segment mix, a higher OEM mix, increased volume and improved cost.  We have completed our media integration and are on track to meet our previously stated plans of full cost benefit by the December quarter.  Operating expenses totaled $184 million, or 9.2% of revenue, up slightly from the March quarter as a result of increased R&D spending. As compared to the prior year, operating expenses are up as a result of the Media acquisition, higher incentive compensation associated with stronger financial performance, and increased investments in new programs to support technological advancements and our broadening product portfolio.  Operating income was $241 million, or 12.1% of revenue. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $4 million. This includes about $2 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments in auction-rate securities. These investments totaled $28 million at the end of the quarter.  Tax expense for the June quarter was $24 million and includes a $15 million incremental tax charge related to the license of intellectual property to subsidiaries. For fiscal 2009, we expect our book effective tax rate to range between 7% and 10% as we take into account our expected continuing profitability and the global mix of taxation by geographic location.  Our cash tax rate for fiscal ‘08 was approximately 1%, and fiscal 2009’s cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2%.  Our net income totaled $213 million, or $0.94 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter totaled $1.1 billion as compared to $917 million at the end of March. These amounts exclude the $28 million in auction-rate securities that were reclassified as long-term investments during the June quarter, as their immediate liquidity continues to be constrained by the market.  During fiscal ‘08, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations. Cash generated from operations during the June quarter totaled $318 million.  Capital additions for fiscal ‘08 totaled $615 million and included approximately $120 million for our 8-inch wafer-fab conversion. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal ‘08 totaled $413 million. Capital expenditures for the June quarter were $146 million and our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $113 million.  We expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to be about $800 million, including about $150 million for our 8-inch wafer fab conversion.  Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $475 million. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the June quarter. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 16.6 million shares at a total cost of $248 million, for an average price of about $15 per share. A total of $502 million remains under our existing stock repurchase authorization.  Going forward, we will weigh opportunities to repurchase our stock against other investment opportunities and prepayments of our outstanding debt as we take our typical opportunistic approach to share repurchases. As of the end of June, we had 46 days of receivables outstanding, 27 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 69 days of payables. This resulted in a cash conversion cycle of four days. Going forward, we will continue to weigh working capital investments against opportunities for growth and opportunities to reduce shipping costs.  During Q4, we increased our ocean shipments of certain products to help offset price increases from higher fuel costs. Air freight continues to be a key element in our ability to satisfy changes in customer demand for our hard drives. Before I address Q1 earnings guidance, I want to point out that WD will have a 14-week quarter in this fiscal year and we will include that extra week in our fourth fiscal quarter that will end on July 3, 2009.  Now I will discuss our expectations for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009 but first let me outline the market situation as we see it. Compared with established historical demand, it is important to note that last year’s September quarter was extraordinary. However, based on the demand patterns that we have seen thus far in this quarter, we expect a return to the more seasonally normal Q1 demand patterns of 8% to 14% sequential unit growth in the markets we serve. In addition, all the HDD companies are now in a position to provide most required capacities across the entire 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch product lines.  As John indicated in his remarks, the higher-than-expected distribution price erosion in Q408 established the starting point for Q109 and also affected OEM pricing negotiations for this quarter. Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue growth for WD in a range of between 3% and 8%. Consequently, we are forecasting total revenues for the current quarter to be $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion.  We are modeling gross margin at approximately 19.3%. Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $190 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $4 million, assuming no further investment losses. We anticipate our tax rate to be 8% of pretax income, and our share count to be approximately flat with the June quarter.  Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.81 and $0.89 for the September quarter.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Thank you. A few questions, I guess first, can you give us a sense on Komag’s contribution in the fiscal fourth quarter, both from a margin and a revenue perspective and whether or not you think as you move forward, you’ll continue to see some further synergies from Komag?
Tim Leyden: Komag, Rich, we got 80 basis points in the December quarter, a further 40 basis points in the March quarter, and an additional 80 basis points in the June quarter, so we are at a cumulative 200 basis points of increased gross margin, or reduced cost, is a better way to put it, as we stand at this point. We are still on track and expect to reach full cost benefit by the end of December of this year and we expect that to happen pretty much linearly between now and then.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: So that means 100 basis points at least in the 19.3 is coming from Komag. I guess that begs the question, how much of the business do you normally walk into at the beginning of a quarter through auctions with OEMs? And does that really vary by desktop versus notebook?
John F. Coyne: I think first, the 100 basis points is spread over the next two quarters in terms of contribution from the Komag cost improvement. And the -- typically the vast bulk of our OEM business is decided before we exit the prior quarter. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, so the opportunity for upside to your gross margin guidance then has to largely occur within the channel, and so if channel prices are less aggressive than what you are at least anticipating in your guidance, then that would represent the opportunity for upside, plus mix, I guess?
John F. Coyne: We’re running the business the way we run the business. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and just lastly on your new enterprise announcement, how much of the market do you think, since it is a new drive, can really be addressed by this 2.5-inch 10K product, which I think most vendors have largely shied away from? And then moving that, if you wanted to migrate that 2.5-inch SAS product, how much engineering and time would that take?
John F. Coyne: I think the good news is that there’s a significant infrastructure now in place, and continuing for 2.5-inch form factor in both the blade server and storage markets. And our desire would be to see similar adoption of SATA in that space that we’ve seen over the past four or five years in the 3.5-inch space, so that’s item one.  To your second question, I think the engineering investment in mainstream enterprise is significant, both in terms of development and support, once serving that market. And as we’ve said, our long-term guidance in the 8% to 10% OpEx range adequately covers what we believe is necessary to participate in that market. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Keith Bachmann with Bank of Montreal, your line is open. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you. I wanted to ask you about mix, both in Q4 and then embedded in your guidance in Q1. This quarter you had a much higher percent of OEM versus disti and retail, and I just want to try to understand how that mix in particular is incorporated within your guidance -- does the mix stay the same? I assume that disti would tick up as a percent, but I just wanted to get a little color on that, and then I have a follow-up, please. 
Tim Leyden: As John indicated, we navigated pretty much away from the distribution in order to have a different channel mix, the different segment mix in Q4, and got the benefit of that. As we go into Q1, again the starting point of the pricing has pretty much been set, so we will have an impact on the OEM pricing, as John also indicated. And we expect to have a 2.5 -- with the 2.5 at this stage, 2.5-inch, we’re seeing that most suppliers at this stage have the capability to provide a broad mix. And so consequently, I think that our mix in Q109 will resemble the broader market, whereas we’ve had a competitively advantaged view of that for the last few quarters. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: So Tim, just to push you a little bit, does that mean that disti goes up as a percent of your total units in Q1?
John F. Coyne: The other thing in relation to that to recognize is that while the desktop disti market if a 50-50 disti and OEM market, the 2.5-inch space is more like 80-20 OEM -- 80% OEM, 20% disti, so our success in the 2.5-inch space in and of itself dilutes our overall distribution content in our business.
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: But I was thinking, John, if more people are participating in the 2.5-inch space that might suggest that your disti content would actually go up this quarter. 
John F. Coyne: Not necessarily. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, well, I’ll leave it but then the second question is I just wanted to get some thoughts -- your weighted average price this quarter was $56. Does that go up, down, or flat you think in the September quarter?
Tim Leyden: If we look at historical norms, generally it stays about flat or maybe slightly up. 
Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Mark Miller with Brean Murray. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.:   I was wondering if you could comment -- we’ve seen some data in the channel where we are seeing additional pricing pressure, some added rebates from one of your competitors. Are you seeing any worsening of the channel since the quarter began in terms of pricing?
John F. Coyne: I think nothing unseasonal; I mean, recognize that we came in at a pretty low point and expectations I think were not there that the inventory had actually been worked off during last quarter. I think there was a -- despite the data to the contrary, I think there was an expectation that the -- there was more product around than there needed to be, and so turning that perception around has taken a little bit of time. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.:   One of your competitors for the first time has indicated, apparently the first time in 10 years indicated the possible intention of buying significant [inaudible] from one of your suppliers, TDK. I realize that’s later this year. Do you anticipate that will have any affect on your in terms of pricing or supply?
John F. Coyne: No, I don’t. We’ve had a very consistent approach to sourcing in the open market since we acquired our internal head capability. We’ve had a very long relationship with TDK SAE, a very positive relationship. They are a great supplier. We believe they perceive us as a great customer and we expect to continue to advantage each other as we move forward. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.:   Finally, any changes in the percent of heads that you are buying from outside in the June quarter over previous quarters? Has that stayed the same, gone up, gone down?
John F. Coyne: Pretty much the same. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.:   Thank you. 
Operator: Richard Kaiser with Sanford Bernstein.
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Could you just talk about how you are seeing development of solid state drives into 2009? Is that primarily still a high-end product? It seems that there are a number of NetBooks that are looking, or incorporating solid states. Can you just give us some idea of how you are perceiving that and its development now?
John F. Coyne: Sure. I think we’re looking at it in three distinct market applications for SSDs, the first of those being in the high-end enterprise, which is an [inaudible] requirement, a performance requirement, not really a large storage requirement. And so we’ve seen announcements in that space. We believe that there’s some compelling value being offered there and there certainly seems to be an economic case, as well as a technical case for deployment of SSDs into that kind of environment.  The second area where SSDs have probably been most heavily marketed and have been lightly distributed is in the high style notebook arena -- full featured, full sized notebook, things like the Macbook Air and several announcements from most of the PC notebook manufacturers. In that space, we believe that the customer experience, those few customers who actually have one, that the customer experience has been essentially negative, relative to the overhyped benefits. And that that potentially puts back -- that and the cost put back the adoption rate probably by 12 months against current forecasts.  And then the third area of application has been in the ultra-mobile PC, or the SUSE EPC type market, which is a market focused on meeting price point and providing a level of functionality at a price point.  What we are seeing there is the first generation of those devices, essentially they were with four, eight, 12-gigabytes of Flash memory, and what we are seeing in this year’s announcements over the last couple of months of the second generation is that that market seems to be bifurcating to on the low end, $399 type price point, a 7-inch screen with a 12-gig of SSD and probably a Linux operating system. And then a more functional, more feature, richer machine at somewhere in the $400 pricing point, which is going to a 10-inch screen, operating an XP-based system, and incorporating a 2.5-inch hard drive. So that’s kind of how we are seeing that shaking out.  And it looks like the low-end machine is beginning to develop some penetration in completely new markets that have lower disposable income levels than the markets currently being served by the entire PC portfolio, and we are seeing the higher featured machine targeted as incremental sales into developed markets, where a second PC or a third PC is being bought in that fashion. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: That’s very helpful. Thank you. Could you just perhaps give an estimate of what you though SSD share was in 2008 calendar, or where you think it will be in calendar 2008 and then calendar 2009, just approximately?
John F. Coyne: It’s really hard. I don’t think it gets into more than one decimal place. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, gentlemen; I want to first get back to the rank and file, if you could, in terms of the swing factors for your outlook. Getting back to Mr. Bachmann’s question as far as the OEM mix, can you kind of rank order how much is OEM mix versus maybe potential share loss, as manufacturing parity does increase in terms of your competitors now able to execute? And then thirdly, just general pricing dynamics. 
Tim Leyden: On the pricing dynamics, and I’ll leave the other part or portion of the question to John, but on the pricing dynamics, we are modeling towards the higher end of what would be the historical norm, so that’s what we see out in the marketplace. 
John F. Coyne: We’re not modeling share loss. We’re modeling that our mix, which has been very rich, from the beginning of last fiscal year and getting a little lighter each quarter as we move through the year, our mix becomes to look much like the market demand, and that’s driven by two dimensions. One is that our growth has basically meant that we need to service a market lookalike demand because of our size at each account, and the other piece of that is that as our competitors have gradually come up with the ability to ship the full range of capacities, that provides more choice to our customers also. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you on that part. And then, have you ever given us any context around the notebook class drive shipments that WD exhibits each quarter in terms of how much is going into an actual PC versus external back-up? When you guys say you are shipping notebook, is that all for notebook PCs or is that for other as well?
John F. Coyne: It’s for all 2.5-inch shipments, the 11.7 million is our total 2.5-inch shipments. Some of that went into notebook PCs, some of it went into external storage solutions built by others, and some of it went into our own branded products. We don’t break it out. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: You don’t break it out. Is it fair to say that that piece though, the notebook class is higher than your overall branded business, in terms of 2.5-inch versus 3.5-inch shipping into the retail market?
John F. Coyne: I’m not sure I’m getting the question right. Certainly our shipments into notebook computers are significantly larger than the shipments into the external attached marketplace. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then if we could shift gears, John, could you maybe talk a little about your new product tone in terms of -- obviously you said you won’t pre-announce products until you actually start shipping, but your tone seems to be a little more constructive, I think ever since November of ’06 when you first started talking about the enterprise as a potential market. Can you maybe just talk about what’s changed and should we expect more announcements in the coming months ahead?
John F. Coyne: Well, absolutely. I mean, I certainly hope we’ll be making lots of announcements over the course of the next year in order to maintain our current position in the marketplace and actually improve it, so yes, you may expect a significant stream of product announcements over time. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: I’m talking about new market entry though in terms of markets you are not currently serving, I’m sorry. 
John F. Coyne: You’ll just have to watch the specific product announcements. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then maybe you can talk a little more about the ST Micro IP and the team. Can you talk about what that can mean for the model, what that can mean for some of your design or new product development down the road?
John F. Coyne: Certainly. As you’ve seen over the past five years, as we’ve grown the company and grown the financial resources of the company, we have also in parallel been gathering in the fundamental technology capability to drive the business forward and to improve the fundamental efficiency from an engineering perspective. When you own all of the technology pieces, you can better and more efficiently and more timely put together the optimization of the system, and so we did that with Hedge, we did it with Media, and we’ve now brought HDC controller design and development back into the company again. We’ve had it outside for maybe eight years, I guess, something in that range. So we brought that capability back in house and the objective there is to improve the efficiency so that the HDC core, just like all of our competitors have their own HDC capability, we now have that and therefore all of the firmware that we write to operate that core can now be common across our multiple drive platforms, and can be -- we’ll continue to then embed that technology in the SOCs, paired up with the best channel and the best execution with our existing SOC suppliers.  So it helps us on efficiency and it helps us on speed. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you. If I could just squeeze one more in -- 
Bob Blair: Next question, Mark. We’ll come back. 
Operator: Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch.
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Just getting back to the revenue guidance and maybe as you look out into the rest of the fiscal year, it sounds like you are not seeing any kind of slowdown in demand from any of the end markets. Is that true? And if there’s any acceleration or anything else that’s going on, could you talk about how you view the end markets, given you have another three months to look at the economy?
Tim Leyden: We are seeing all the commentaries like everybody else is seeing from the reporting companies, talking about headwinds and we’re watching very closely in order to see whether there is anything that would be significantly or statistically significantly different from what we would term normal seasonal patterns. And at this point, there isn’t anything that we are seeing. We are seeing normal seasonal patterns.  Having said that, the WD business model is very well-positioned to deal with anything that appears on the macro level because with our focus on asset velocity and our focus on low cost, we are well-positioned to be able to change and adapt, shift focus if we see anything happening. We watch the demand very closely and we are -- but there isn’t anything that we are seeing so far. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just on pricing, your comments tend to lead us to believe that once you get this hangover in the September quarter from pricing pressures, that the December quarter may look fairly normal off of whatever base we’re in September. What’s the risk that I guess pricing stays tough as you look out beyond this quarter?
Tim Leyden: Given the normal seasonal accommodations and the expected back-to-school season and the seasonally strong Christmas season, and of course always with the caveat of competitive behavior, we would see that once the inventory overhang is gone that we would get back to fairly normal conditions and be able to have a typical upswing in the back half of the year. 
John F. Coyne: And to that point, we saw very disciplined industry production rates last quarter. We were surprised and I believe the industry overall would express surprise with how rapidly the inventory overhang was worked off by moderation of production capacity, and so I think that’s a very, very positive sign for the industry. We’ve just got to see the seasonal demand roll in and maintain that discipline into this quarter, and I think your proposition as you opened your questions that things could get a lot better in the December quarter is pretty sound. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Your branded business continues to show strong growth, despite some slowing on the consumer side. Can you help us understand how you are maintaining those rates? Is it share gains or retail expansion?
John F. Coyne: All of the above. I mean, the fundamental is that we have really cool products that are really easy to understand and easy to use, and that we have great channel partnerships, and that we continue to expand our reach, particularly in Europe and in Asia-Pacific and other developing economies. I mean, we are very, very well-penetrated in the U.S. market but we have lots of growth opportunity in emerging markets. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Operator: Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. I heard a lot of commentary about the desktop market and I apologize if you already comment on this, but can you give us some commentary about what’s going on in the notebook market in terms of pricing? Is it as bad as the desktop market, or is it a little bit better?
John F. Coyne: Notebook is pretty much running to our expectation. It is exhibiting the characteristics of a six supplier market with all six suppliers having capability to address virtually every segment of the market. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then in terms of the CapEx guidance, it looks like CapEx is going up about 30% year over year. It’s a little bit more than I would have expected. Can you maybe help us understand why that’s going up 30%?
Tim Leyden: We had anticipated that we would spend a little bit more during the course of 2008, but as we manage our CapEx to a just-in-time capability, we’ve pushed more out into 2009 and that includes our wafer fab conversion, which you’ll notice that we had anticipated that there was going to be a $200 million expenditure in that in the course of 2008 and we actually came in at about 120, I believe. And in 2009, we were going to have $100 million and the slowdown that we had in 2008 is actually spilling over into 2009, which is responsible for most of the up-tick. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then I just have a quick question on the bringing in of the controller design technology -- does that allow you to design a controller for a solid state drive or is that only going to allow you access to design for the HDD controllers?
John F. Coyne: We will have the capability to design a controller for any media and any interface. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Thank you. Just on the -- a follow-up again on the controller question; are you ultimately trying to bring the design of your system on-chip controller entirely in-house?
John F. Coyne: Controller portion, yes. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Perfect. And then, if one wanted to be an optimist, if possible, the good news that you highlight is that production and inventory are at last in check. Seagate obviously flushed through their entire inventory by getting their builds wrong. The rest of the industry behaved the best they could and watched them sell all those drives. The good news is that perhaps if seasonality and demand continues in the December quarter, that gross margins could improve. 
Tim Leyden: Yeah, I mean, that’s what the expectation would be if we get back to -- if we get back to a normal back-to-school season and normal demand patterns in the Christmas quarter, yes. And with the inventory overhang gone, yes, there should be an improvement in margins. 
John F. Coyne: Which would be extremely good, given that current margins that we are forecasting are already higher than last year. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Right, exactly. Thank you. 
Operator: Matt [Nahorski] with Wachovia.
Matt Nahorski - Wachovia: Just a couple of quick questions about headcount; number one, can you just talk about where you added headcount in the quarter and what your thoughts are around headcount throughout fiscal ’09? Thanks. 
John F. Coyne: You’ll see headcount increase substantially in the quarterly report, up to 50,000 from about 42. That’s really a factor of a decision that we made in Thailand to convert a large number of contract workers to full-time WD direct employees. Outside of that reclassification, and that brought them into the WD employee report, outside of that reclassification, our hiring was pretty normal, targeting support of our growth as well as specific investments in engineering and other parts of the support structure of the business to drive our future. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Scott Craig with Banc of America. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just quickly on the CapEx side of things; if I strip out the wafer expenditures, the CapEx is still going to be up around 30% year over year in fiscal 2009, so can you maybe discuss where the CapEx is going to be spent, in particular focusing on how much capacity, perhaps in percentage or in units that you think that you could add?
Tim Leyden: Our component expenditure and our media expenditure together accounts for close to two-thirds of the total CapEx expenditure. And then, in addition to that we have to deal with the mix of test, as the mix gets larger, the -- we have to spend more time on test and therefore more capital expenditure. So the remainder is in the back-end, which is assembly test and R&D type expenditure. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Okay, so you don’t have any rough estimate on how much you’ll think you’ll increase the unit capacity capabilities in 2009? And is there any -- how does the linearity of the expenditures occur over the course of the year? How much flexibility do you have there?
Tim Leyden: What we’ve been spending in normal business situation, other than the increment that we are spending for the wafer fab conversion, for several years it was at 6% of revenue, and then with media, added about another percent. So consequently, from a modeling viewpoint, a good model to use excluding the increment for wafer conversion, wafer fab conversion is in the 7% range or so. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Okay, and if I could just ask one more -- there was a couple of times on the call where you mentioned that you felt that the competitors were capable of providing all products across all the ranges for 2.5 and 3.5-inch, but it’s been clear that you guys have had a nice technological lead in the 2.5-inch notebook space, so can you describe the competitive dynamics there, whether you still think you have a lead, how far that lead is, and how long you think it will last, the gap between yourselves and competitors?
John F. Coyne: Of course, it will be our endeavor to maintain it forever. I think we are still advantaged somewhat in the sense that we’ve built the franchise over the last year and we will certainly endeavor to maintain that. And we’ll make product announcements as we ship product. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Do you feel the competition is closing that gap at all, or will close it in the back part of calendar 2008?
John F. Coyne: I think we’ll have to wait and see who ships what when, and then we’ll know. We don’t pay much attention to announcements of future intent. We focus more on what actually gets done. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America: All right, thanks. 
John F. Coyne: So in closing, I would like to thank you again for joining us. We are very encouraged by the overall market opportunities for WD growth in the hard drive markets in the years ahead and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) Now I’ll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. 
Bob Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning our opportunities and demand in the hard drive industry; customer preference for the WD brand; our capital expenditures; repurchases of our stock; our short-term investments; our cash conversion cycle; seasonality of the June quarter; and our current financial outlook for the June quarter.  These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 5, 2008 as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. I would now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital. 
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today is CFO Tim Leyden. The market for hard drives continued to demonstrate strong year-on-year unit growth of 16.2% in the March quarter, while exhibiting an 8.6% seasonal decline from the exceptionally strong December quarter, as we had anticipated in our original guidance for the third quarter issued on January 23rd.  We are extremely pleased with the March quarter results we released earlier today. The WD team again delivered excellent performance, continuing our strong track record of profitable growth.  Our Q3 revenue performance reflects customer preference for the WD value proposition of quality and reliability, a compelling product portfolio, and responsive and timely availability, supported by a demonstrated willingness and capability to invest in the future. Our earnings performance is the result of healthy market demand, a competitive cost structure, disciplined financial management, and a committed team with a passion to succeed. Let me share some highlights of our March quarter performance compared with the same quarter last year: hard drive revenues rose by 43% to $2 billion and 22 million; hard drive unit shipments grew by 41% to 34.5 million; earnings per share expanded by 132% to $1.23; gross margins increased 680 basis points to 22.6%.  We continued to demonstrate financial and operational discipline, generating substantial cash from operations and maintaining our industry-leading asset velocity. From the beginning of the quarter we focused closely on sales linearity and achieved a significant improvement in performance year-on-year. Our sales in the final week of the quarter were 9.8% of our total quarter volume, compared with 13% in the same week a year ago.  As we watched demand and supply patterns emerge throughout the quarter, we made the decision to shut down our component and drive factories for substantially all of the last week of the quarter. We did so in order to balance our supply with demand and ensure that we created no overhang of inventory to pressure the seasonally-weak June quarter.  Consequently our total inventory remained flat quarter-on-quarter at an industry leading 25 days, which included finished goods up modestly by less than one day of supply. This supply/demand alignment action reduced gross margins in the quarter by some 60 basis points.  Reflecting our confidence in the future of the hard drive industry and WD’s strategy and business model, we announced a new share buyback authorization of $500 million over five years.  We continue to grow faster than the industry in practically all market segments we serve -- desktop, enterprise, branded and mobile. The one exception to the WD growth story in the March quarter was our DVR business where, consistent with our January commentary, we chose to reduce our volumes in order to improve profitability in that business.  A key driver of our success is our focus on product quality and reliability. During the quarter, WarrantyWeek published an analysis of five-year warranty claim trends for U.S. tech companies. This data highlights significant and consistent improvement by WD over the last five years.  We have lowered the cost of warranty claims from an industry competitive 1.9% of revenues in 2003 to a clear industry leadership position of 0.9% in calendar year 2007. At the same time, we have extended our average warranty period by some 50%.  While these improvements fall straight to the WD bottom line, more important is the fact that our customers also benefit substantially from the lower cost of ownership of WD drives and enhanced customer perception of systems which incorporate WD drives.  Earlier this week, we announced availability of the WD VelociRaptor 2.5-inch 300 gigabyte 10,000 RPM hard drive, the next generation product in our popular WD Raptor enterprise SATA family. This is the fastest SATA drive available in the industry today, delivering a 35% performance improvement over the WD Raptor drive.  At 300-gigabytes, it delivers the industry’s highest capacity in a 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM drive, double that currently available from competition. It incorporates the highest areal density shipping in the industry, at 290 gigabits per square inch.  Our IcePack adapter allows the drive to be mounted in a 3.5-inch drive bay while reducing operating temperature some seven degrees further improving long-term reliability.  WD VelociRaptor continues our industry-leading GreenPower initiative launched last July by delivering all of these attributes while consuming 35% less power than the previous Raptor family. This product demonstrates the continued momentum in WD’s development and deployment of leading technologies and further enhances our broad product portfolio.  In summary, we are pleased with our sustained progress against our profitable growth objective year to date. We continue to feel good about the robust demand forecasted in our industry over the next several years and about WD’s opportunity to continue to prosper by providing compelling solutions to customers.  Tim will now provide a Q3 financial report and our outlook for Q4. Tim.
Tim Leyden: Thank you, John. Our March results reflect strong execution by the WD team. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our operational flexibility and financial management discipline to carefully match supply with demand. This resulted in outstanding revenue growth and operational results that delivered 680 basis points of gross margin improvement over the same quarter last year and revenue and earnings that exceeded our updated guidance.  A strong January and February, coupled with a measured approach to March’s more competitive environment, led to better revenue linearity for WD year-on-year, enabling us to generate $431 million in operating cash flow and pay down $260 million in debt, while also repurchasing $44 million of common stock.  Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.1 billion. This includes $89 million from external sales of media and substrates. Hard drive revenue of $2.022 billion was up 43% from the prior year and hard drive shipments totaled 34.5 million units, up 41% from the prior year period.  Average hard drive selling price was approximately $59 per unit, down $2 from the December quarter and up $1 from the year-ago quarter. Product and channel mix changes as well as expected seasonal pricing factors contributed to the quarterly ASP decline. The percentage of our hard drive revenue generated by non-desktop PC applications was 54% in the March quarter, consistent with the December quarter, and it was 47% for the year-ago quarter. We shipped 10.2 million 2.5-inch mobile drives in the March quarter, as compared to 8.7 million in the December quarter and 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter. These increases were driven by continued strength in overall mobile storage demand coupled with increased customer preference for WD product offerings.  Sales in our desktop, enterprise and branded products businesses were in line with our expectations.  In consumer electronics, we shipped 3.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the March quarter versus 4.1 million in the December quarter and 2.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Our moderation of unit shipments in this market generated the desired outcome of improved margins. We continue to believe that this market offers us long-term profitable growth opportunities. Hard drive channel revenue was 50% OEM, 34% distribution and 16% branded products versus 48% OEM, 34% distribution and 18% branded in the December quarter; and it was 47% OEM, 34% distribution and 19% branded in the year-ago quarter. These percentages exclude external sales of media and substrates, which totaled $89 million in the March quarter, or 4% of revenue, and $120 million in the December quarter, or 5% of revenue. As a reminder, there were no media and substrate sales in the year-ago quarter as we had not yet made the media acquisition.  There was no single customer that comprised more than 10% of total revenue, reflecting a healthy diversity of customers in multiple markets. The Q3 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 28% Americas, 31% Europe and 41% Asia, as compared to 32% Americas, 32% Europe and 36% Asia in the December quarter; and it was 36% Americas, 29% Europe and 35% Asia in the year-ago quarter. These percentages also exclude external sales of media and substrates. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 22.6% versus 23.3% in the December quarter and 15.8% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin versus Q2 came from more competitive pricing, a higher OEM mix and the negative impact of our one week factory shut down, offset by increased volume and improved cost.  Operating expenses totaled $179 million, or 8.5% of revenue. Total operating expense was slightly down from the December quarter. As compared to the prior year, operating expenses are up as a result of adding media operations, higher incentive compensation associated with stronger financial performance, and increased investments in new programs to support technological advancements and our broadening product portfolio.  Operating income was $298 million, or 14% of revenue. Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $8 million. This includes about $3 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments in auction-rate securities. These investments totaled $30 million at the end of the quarter.  Our $10 million tax provision for the March quarter is approximately 3.5% of quarterly income before taxes and the year-to-date rate is approximately 4%, excluding Q1 non-recurring items. We expect that our rate for the full year will continue to be at the low end of our previously stated 4% to 6% range.  Our net income totaled $280 million, or $1.23 per share.  In March we announced a realignment of our media operations related to the planned completion of the majority of our external media and substrate supply obligations. The total estimated cost of this realignment is about $16 million. This was recorded as an adjustment to the goodwill balance as of the end of the quarter and did not impact March’s operating results.  We continued to make excellent progress on our media integration and are on track to meet our previously stated plans of full integration by the December quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $949 million as compared to $967 million at the end of December.  Cash generated from operations during the quarter totaled $431 million.  Capital expenditures for the quarter of $137 million were lower than our original expectation. Our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $111 million. For the first nine months of 2008, our capital expenditures totaled $469 million. We now expect capital expenditures to be about $625 million for fiscal 2008, about $75 million lower than our most recent guidance as we align expenditures with anticipated demand and realized efficiency gains. Fiscal 2008 depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $410 million.  We reduced debt by a total of $260 million during the March quarter. We repaid the $760 million bridge loan and replaced it with a five-year credit facility that consists of a $500 million term loan, which is currently outstanding, and a currently unutilized $250 million revolving line of credit.  We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock for $44 million. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 16.6 million shares at a total cost of $248 million, for an average price of about $15 per share. Earlier this month, we announced an increase to our stock repurchase plan of $500 million. Going forward, we will weigh opportunities to repurchase our stock against other investment opportunities and prepayments of our outstanding debt as we take our typical opportunistic approach to share repurchases. As of the end of March, we had cash and cash equivalents of $917 million and short-term investments of $32 million, which included $30 million of auction-rate securities. These auction-rate securities are currently accounted for as current assets and are held as available for sale securities. However, if the liquidity of these securities continues to be constrained by the market, we may have to reclassify them as long-term investments.  As of the end of March, we had 44 days of receivables outstanding, 25 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 64 days of payables. This resulted in a cash conversion cycle of 5 days, which is within our stated model range of 4 to 8 days. Going forward, we expect to trend towards the high end of that range as we weigh working capital investments against opportunities for growth in new markets and opportunities to reduce shipping costs.  I will now discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2008.  Revenue for the March quarter included $89 million from the sales of media and substrates to external customers. As we indicated previously, we will not in future be breaking out the amount of revenue generated from these external sales due to the planned reduction in these activities and the expected insignificant impact on our total revenue.  Historically, drive demand goes down sequentially from the March to June quarter by approximately 2% to 3%. We would normally expect natural demand reductions in this range. However, late March competitive market dynamics now lead us to forecast a reduction of 4% to 6% and competitive pricing at the high end of historical norms in the June quarter. Consequently, we are forecasting total revenues to be in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.9 billion. This represents an increase of between 34% and 39% over the prior year period.  We are modeling gross margin of approximately 20%. While this is down from the March quarter, it represents a 500 basis point increase over the 15% gross margin we reported for the June quarter of 2007.  Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $180 million as we continue to invest in expanding our product and technology portfolio.  Our net interest expense is projected to be about $5 million, assuming no further investment losses.  We anticipate our tax rate to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 4% to 6% of pretax income, and our share count to be approximately flat with the March quarter. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.77 and $0.83 for the June quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steven Fox. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: I was wondering if you could go back over a couple of things. You mentioned how you made a decision to close production in the last week of the quarter. Could you give us some more insight to how that decision was made, on what timing? And is it possible that you would consider to do the same thing and for a longer period in the June quarter, given the demand pressures or the economic concerns that are out there? And then I had a follow-up. 
John F. Coyne: We, as I mentioned, we track the progress of the market and our progress in the market on a weekly basis and we make decisions on what we are seeing in those market dynamics relative to matching our supply with the demand that we anticipate, updated by those weekly pulsing of the market. And we did that through last quarter and we made appropriate decision to reduce production in order to ensure that our ending inventories were appropriate to the forward-looking demand and didn’t overhand the market.  We will watch progress as we go through this quarter and we will align our production to the demand. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Could you also talk about the decision on the capital spending plans? What does that -- how much of that is efficiency related versus more conservative demand outlook for say the next 12 months?
John F. Coyne: I think the demand outlook, we believe that the fundamental dynamics, the demand for storage growing at about 60% on an annual year-over-year basis in terms of petabytes of storage, serve us to buy a 40% to 45% areal density growth and a 15% plus unit growth. We believe those forecasts of demand remain intact. That’s the kind of demand profile I expect as we look forward. We believe that the seasonality of the business is fundamentally tracking to historical norms. As you look at that long-term outlook, the primary influence on our deferral of capital investment was realized efficiency gains of our existing installed capacity base. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Sherri Scribner, you may ask your question and please state your company name. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: We’ve heard a lot of comments from Seagate and others about aggressive pricing in the March quarter. Can you maybe give us a little more detail in terms of where you saw aggressive pricing? I think Seagate commented that they saw it on high [cap] and desktop. There were some comments that there was aggressive pricing in notebook OEM. Can you maybe give us some more detail there?
John F. Coyne: Well, the drive business continues to be a competitive business. We did see some greater than anticipated pricing action in late March, particularly. And as I noted, we had put a lot of emphasis with our sales force and our business teams to improve the linearity of our sales efforts through the March quarter, and we achieved that to a very large degree, shipping under 10% of our total units in the final week of the quarter. Our data from the industry would suggest that the rest of the industry shipped about 16.5% of their total units in the final week of the quarter. And we believe that that puts significant pressure on pricing as the quarter closed, leading to a start point for the current quarter that is lower than we would have liked to see.  However, if you -- the guidance that Tim gave a moment ago indicates that we expect to see that end of March exit influence pricing this quarter, having it trend towards the higher end of seasonal normal pricing, and we saw a little bit of a slow start influenced by the inventory overhangs that were present starting the quarter.  But the underlying trends quarter to date meets our expectations. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: I guess I wonder, is the pricing worse than what you saw last year when we had aggressive pricing in notebook, or would you say it’s relatively similar? I mean, you said that it was a little bit worse than you would have expected. 
John F. Coyne: I think the profile is pretty much towards the high-end of the pricing activity that we see, but you have to bear in mind that the entire industry -- well, certainly WD is running 500 basis points higher on the gross margin level this year than last in terms of our guidance for the quarter. So I think the industry is in much better shape but the overall seasonality overlays an industry that is in fundamentally better shape. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s helpful. And then maybe if I could squeak in a question about your gross margin; how much did the Komag acquisition help your gross margins this quarter and how much more do you expect to get out of the Komag acquisition as we move through the calendar year?
Tim Leyden: You’ll recall we indicated that we had gotten 80 basis points in the December quarter. We added another 40 basis points approximately in this quarter, and that leaves us to pick -- up over the next three quarters, we have to pick up the remaining 180 basis points of the 300 basis point cost improvement that we indicated we were going to get by the end of December. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Mark Moskowitz, your line is open. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: A few questions, if I could, John and Tim. When you talk about the guidance as far as the ranges you gave for the industry growth and your revenue growth, how should we think about the puts and takes in terms of your unit expectations relative to that 4% to 6% decline, as well as your ASPs? Are you going to grow at or below market?
Tim Leyden: Actually, from an ASP viewpoint -- we don’t go into units but from an ASP viewpoint, from Q3 to Q4 we see historically price declines being at the upper end of the spectrum due to seasonally lower demand and lower mix upgrades due to a higher percentage of our business going into the OEM channel, which means because it’s a weaker -- it’s a weaker quarter for both retail and the distribution spot market. So consequently, we would expect the ASPs to be down similar to what they have been historically. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then how should we think about the retail performance in the quarter? You’ve enjoyed great momentum there over the past couple of years because of sound execution and a very good product reception, but I was kind of perplexed by the slowdown there sequentially. 
John F. Coyne: Well, I think the -- we are very happy with our continued position in the branded products area and the retail area. There is one WD specific issue in that we were transitioning from our older passport industrial design to our new offering, so we were moving from the any color you want as long as it’s black to our new palette of 15 different colors and finishes, as well as segmented market functionality with products targeted at individual markets.  So we constrained sell-in in order to flush the existing inventories out of the retail channel. Our sell-out was robust. However, we constrained sell-in in order to clear the existing inventories before restocking with the new product line. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, so that was deliberate then -- there was no sort of issue in terms of disruption as you tried to move to that more broad-based industrial design?
John F. Coyne: No surprises. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then how should we think about that snap-back then, relative to your broader industry comments? Could you maybe have some wiggle room there where retail maybe bounces back a little better in June?
Tim Leyden: I think that seasonally, retail in the June quarter tends to be -- it tends to be the weakest quarter of the year for retail, so I would anticipate something similar in the June quarter. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then just lastly, can you maybe just talk about what you are seeing in Europe? Particularly, your Europe business I think has been really strong on the retail side and a lot of comments from some of your peers and some of the distis out there are suggesting that Europe is starting to really exhibit signs of some deterioration as saw start in the U.S. about six months ago. 
John F. Coyne: I think if we looked at the quarter to date pattern, Europe is a little slow out of the traps from a distribution perspective. Overall, the business is tracking exactly as on a worldwide basis -- the industry is tracking as we expect. A little stronger in OEM, a little weaker in European disti. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Rich Kugele, you may ask your question and please state your company name.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Good afternoon. Two quick questions; first, on your notebook share, obviously you’ve gained a fair amount in recent quarters. Have you sensed any indications from the OEMs that they are uncomfortable with that level of share that Seagate sometimes hears their enterprise business? Or do you think that any share improvements that happen at Seagate as they get more on par on areal density can come out of other people, that that doesn’t necessarily have to come out of you?
John F. Coyne: Our current position in notebook is driven by our product portfolio, our execution relative to timely availability, and our quality and reliability demonstration, allied to our forward-looking roadmap for products in that space. So we are certainly not seeing any signs of customer resistance to that compelling value offering. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and then just lastly to follow-up on your prepared comments there on the VelociRaptor, I mean effectively, unlike the previous Raptor which had been somewhat more of a niche product accepted by the high performance community, this one really is an enterprise 2.5-inch in a 3.5-inch clothing. Can you just talk about how much of a leap it is to take this product and actually make it a 2.5-inch enterprise class SASS for example, or the next leap in technology to get it to be a pure play enterprise?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think as I mentioned, the product is a very significant demonstration of our continued momentum in technology deployment, offering as it does a leading areal density in the industry today.  You are correct; we are selling it in the 3.5-inch clothing, targeted specifically at the high performance workstation and the high energy gaming environment, where the Raptor has established a very powerful brand position for us.  However, as a 2.5-inch drive, it is also targeted at the blade server market in that SATA drives plug into SASS [back links]. So we expect to see some significant opportunity there.  As to the rest of your question, you know we never announce product until it is [shipping in bulk]. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Robert Marson, your line is open. Please state your company name. 
Robert Marson : Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congratulations on an excellent quarter and stellar execution. The recent reports have now sort of tallied up last year’s unit growth at over 500 million units and about 18% or 19% in the hard disk drive space. That’s a material acceleration from the prior three or -- two or three years, anyway. Do you see unit growth maintaining a mid-teen level for your fiscal ’09? And do you think that you guys can continue to grow market share or maintain share in the external drive business as well as the 2.5-inch business? And the reason I ask that is obviously your run-rate exiting last quarter was significantly higher than it was 12 months ago and I’m just wondering if you would have any opinion as to where it might be 12 months from now. Thank you. 
John F. Coyne: Sure. Let me separate the two parts of that question. To the overall market, we think what we are seeing is the impact of the non-PC content driven demand for storage -- that is, last year as you said, over 500 million drives shipped against a roughly 300 million PC systems in the year, so a significant greater than 1-to-1 attach rate, drives versus PCs.  We believe a lot of that is being driven by rich content through the Internet, through Flash enabled small mobile devices like cameras and audio players creating significant incremental types of demand that may be hooked to a PC or may be delivered through a completely separate device, such as a DVR.  So we are very positive about those additions to the traditional underlying demand drivers and so we do believe that the 15%, 12% to 15% forecasts that are around are more driven by historical trend analysis than they are by that opportunity analysis of content generation.  So I believe the opportunity is in the 15%-plus unit growth opportunity over the next few years.  To your question about WD, our focus is to continue to provide the WD value proposition of high quality, higher reliability, high availability and responsiveness, a very competitive offering supported by the industry’s lowest cost business model, and using our investments in technology to maintain compelling product portfolios. I think if we can keep doing that, the customers are voting that they like it. 
Robert Marson : And one final point or question -- how do you sort of feel about the entire industry’s profit margin structure and sustainability thereof? I know that in the last four quarters, Western Digital and Seagate have made money. Hitachi for the full trailing 12 months has struggled and the other Asian companies have either broken even or lost money.  When I look at -- when I try to roll up the businesses as best I can, I come to a high single, mid to high single-digit operating margin for the business. Do you feel there has been enough consolidation in addition to organic unit growth opportunities for the whole industry, so that existing pricing structures and profit margin structures can continue within the business, with Hitachi trying to become more profitable? Thank you. 
John F. Coyne: I think there is -- you know, when we look at consolidation, I don’t think there is any compelling trigger to drive further consolidation in the industry. The way we look at the industry today, you’ve got Seagate, a very large, very capable, very profitable company generating significant cash. You’ve got Western Digital, a not so big, well-managed, low cost, high profit, high cash generation business. You’ve got Hitachi, who seem to be finally focusing on the fundamentals of cost structure appropriate to the market opportunities available to them and driving towards a positive outcome.  And then the three -- Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Samsung -- essentially all dependent on the single merchant head supplier, TDK, for their products. And if you look at the financials of TDK, I think that’s where you see where the value is being captured. However, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Samsung, as well as Hitachi, being divisions of large Asian corporate owners, it appears to me that as long as they product marginally positive results on an ongoing basis, they will potentially keep being funded.  However, we have seen evidence over the last year-and-a-half to two years that where they deliver negative results, the parents to not have the patience to allow that to continue for extended periods. 
Robert Marson : You’ve made your intentions known to enter the enterprise businesses. Is there any -- and your chief competitor, Seagate, has sort of done its fair share in the consolidation movement. Is there any change you would try to purchase an enterprise drive business were it to become available?
John F. Coyne: We are looking at all business segments in which we currently don’t participate and assessing the business cases for all of those opportunities. Our experience tells us that organic growth has been the thing that has generated the best results for us. As we’ve watched the outcomes of other people’s horizontal acquisitions at the drive level, while we have focused on vertical acquisitions at the component level and so we don’t currently have any designs on anything other than growing into segments in which we don’t participate where we can close a business case to generate profitable growth from that activity. 
Robert Marson : Thank you very much and congratulations on an excellent quarter. You don’t have a lot of sponsorship on the street, so you won’t get a lot of congratulations on the call, so I guess I need to do two or three of them. Again, congratulations. 
Operator: Mark Miller, you may ask your question and please state your company name.
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: I would certainly like to add my sentiment to the last gentlemen and also agree with his ponderance of why you are not getting more support on the street after an exceptional quarter. I just have a couple of questions. One is the mobile -- you’ve grown very strongly in the mobile units. How are the margins doing there? Are you getting better margins with this growth? Are you maintaining margins?
Tim Leyden: We’ve been very cost competitive in our mobile product lineup and once again I can reaffirm that our margin hierarchy is still intact, which is enterprise, branded products, mobile, desktop, and DVR or CE. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: My second question is are you able to translate your technology leadership in the 3.5 space into share gain at the high end? Are you seeing any share gains at the high end, the higher capacity points?
John F. Coyne: In 3.5?
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: In 3.5.
John F. Coyne: We’ve chosen to deploy our technology first at the volume end of the 3.5-inch market, so we deployed first on our single SATA products and we are moving that technology across the broad range of our overall product line. That’s the strategy that appeared to us to generate the optimal impact on our bottom line, and that deployment across full product range is going very well. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Thank you. 
Operator: David Bailey, you may ask your question. Please state your company name. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on where you are seeing the most pricing, either by segment or product area. 
John F. Coyne: I think we’ve seen most -- I mean, most of the pricing movement has been in the high cap desktop arena. We’ve seen also some pricing activity as more folks have come into the current technology deployment in the 2.5-inch space, so as people have showed up with more cost effective 160s and with 250s and now beginning to see some 320 volumes coming into the market, that’s having an impact on the high-end pricing of the 2.5-inch space as well. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, and could you tell us where you think channel inventory is at this point?
Tim Leyden: Channel inventory is in the normal four to six week range, although as Seagate indicated, it is at the higher end of that metric. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: And where are you, do you think?
Tim Leyden: We are within our normal four to six week range. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Operator: Aaron Rakers, your line is open. Please state your company name. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Thank you for taking the question. I guess I want to dig a little bit more into the gross margin line. If we think about your positioning over the last few quarters in the high capacity notebook market and we think about the competitive landscape going forward, how much has that been a contributor to the gross margin trend? And how should we think about that going forward, as you just mentioned that pricing is starting to look a little bit more aggressive there?
Tim Leyden: Well, in the notebooks specifically, as I indicated to a prior questioner, we’ve got the very cost effective platform and we have benefited from a higher mix, as you indicate. And we have seen more competition in the March quarter at the 250-gigabyte capacity point and at the higher-end, so we do anticipate that there will be a more balanced competitive environment in that going forward.  But again, our most sustainable advantage is our cost competitiveness and we feel pretty comfortable that we would be able to deal with the competitive situation as it arises. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : And when I look at your geographical mix in this last quarter, it looks like North America was down quite a bit on a sequential basis, as well as Europe. Can you give us an idea of what you are seeing in terms of just demand from a geographical perspective?
Tim Leyden: From a geographical point of view, the primary factor in the shift from North America to Japan is primarily in the increase in our -- sorry, to Asia is the increase in our notebook shipments, because most of the OEMs and delivery points are in Asia for notebook. We are seeing North America with normal -- what we would consider normal demand, albeit a little bit softer in North America versus Latin America. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Okay, and then final question for me is when we again look at the retail business, I can understand the transition from a product line perspective, but are you starting to see competition become more effective in that market, i.e. through competitive solutions or just through the breadth of their own channels?
Tim Leyden: No. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Jeff Brickman, you may ask your question and please state your company name. 
Jeff Brickman - CVS: Just a couple quick questions; just on the R&D side of things, you guys have been absolutely pretty incredible at staying at kind of the leading edge technologically and yet you have less than half the R&D spend of some of your competition. I’m just wanting to kind of understand longer term -- do you think that you can continue to do that or maybe should we expect you to kind of go back to the model that you had more a couple of quarters ago and historically where you look to spend a little bit less and then go after markets as they mature?
John F. Coyne: I think we have guided that the long-term expectation is that we will be in the 9% to 10% range on OpEx, of which R&D is a large component. But we will continually strive to be highly efficient in the leverage we get out of that dollar spending. 
Jeff Brickman - CVS: Okay, thanks. And just on -- just one other question, just on notebooks, and I know it’s been kind of asked a couple of different ways but as you look at the market now and you clearly have a bit of a technological advantage. It sounds like a lot of customers, particularly OEMs, are looking to really get your product when and where they can. How do you kind of weigh your relative position versus the potential for price aggression? Do you think you can combat some of it by just obviously having a bit of an advantage there? Or is this going to be a scenario kind of like we saw in high cap last year where there’s basically enough parity or at the very least, people can kind of stack stuff together to be aggressive?
John F. Coyne: Well as Tim said, our focus is -- on the cost side, we have a very high focus on designing for cost and then executing for low cost. And I think that’s a differentiator in that when we addressed the 2.5-inch market five years ago and put our plans together and began to design product, we fast forwarded to the present day where we are rapidly approaching the point where the volumes of 2.5 are going to cross over the volumes of 3.5. And so it’s a -- when we sat down to go look at that business, we said it was going to be a high volume business of similar scale to desktop and therefore that the cost profiles would be similar. And we set out to design a solution to that and we’ve achieved that.  I think some of the incumbents, some of the more traditional suppliers of 2.5-inch drives are lumbered by a fundamental design approach that does not acknowledge those kind of market requirements. And consequently, they have a fundamental cost penalty in attempting to address that market. And I think our customers clearly recognize the quality and reliability has not been compromised by our approach. We are delivering the technology. We are delivering the product capacities and performance levels they want and we are doing that with a very solid credible forward roadmap and manufacturing and supply chain structure that they have confidence will deliver the values that they need over time. 
Jeff Brickman - CVS: Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: [Yun Pak], your line is open. 
Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets : I want to ask about your share repurchase program. Over the last few years, you guys have purchased about $50 million worth of shares. And with your new share authorization, I was wondering if you are going to ramp that up to about $100 million for the duration of the program, or how aggressive will you guys be?
Tim Leyden: Well, as I indicated in my remarks earlier, we will weigh the repurchase opportunities against investment opportunities in other areas, and we will look at repayment of outstanding debt. We haven’t placed any constraints on our potential behavior there, so we are taking an opportunistic approach and where we see that the stock is undervalued and that it is a very good investment, we will take advantage of that as we see the opportunities arise. 
Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets : Okay and one other question on your CapEx, the $75 million cut, can you talk about where, what parts of your business are you guys cutting in terms of capital investment?
Tim Leyden: As John indicated, it’s basically better equipment utilization in drives and components right across the business, and that’s effectively what is driving that and just managing it as we always do in a just-in-time basis, adding capacity just in time as we need it. 
Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets : Are you guys investing less in media heads or drive assembly equipment and testing?
Tim Leyden: Again, I mean, it’s right across the entire business. 
Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Christian Schwab, your line is open. Please state your company name. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: My quick question was regarding finished goods inventory. It kind of appears that the industry is in a similar situation we were in in 2004. Thankfully we only have one guy with a very bloated inventory; we don’t have Maxtor with it as well. But it appears if one wanted to be an optimist, that both you and Seagate’s management may realize that given the significant decline in earnings on a sequential basis you are predicting, Seagate down 40% and yourselves down 35%, do you believe that that ultimately you hope is a conservative rock bottom number, or are you fearful that the environment is a lot worse than that, if you can recall that a few years ago?
Tim Leyden: Rock bottom number -- I don’t know how to answer that one because I really can’t predict but from an inventory viewpoint, manufacturers inventory, we were at seven days at the end of Q2. We are at eight days at the end of Q3, and the rest of the industry was at 10 days at the end of Q2 and was at 15 days at the end of Q3.  Addressing your 40% down quarter on quarter, I think that that’s a bit -- it doesn’t take into account the actual increase that we’ve seen versus this quarter last year, which is 500 basis points. And as well as that, the seasonality, which is generally from Q3 to Q4, has been down. And last year our EPS was $0.38, so we are forecasting between $0.77 and $0.83. If you don’t think that’s a good increase, I don’t know how I can help you. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Do you guys still calculate distribution inventory on a 13-week rolling average versus Seagate at a four-week rolling average?
Tim Leyden: We never did it on a 13-week rolling average. Seagate has done it at a 13-week rolling average previously, but this quarter I think that they actually changed that metric. 
Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Scott Craig. 
Scott Craig - Banc of America : Just two quick questions here; first on the DVR side, is there more opportunity to improve the profitability there and is it necessary to walk away from business and maybe grow slower than the market in order to achieve that, or are there other ways you can achieve it? And then secondly, another question on inventory; from an inventory perspective, I guess the one thing that some people are concerned about is everyone in the industry is pointing to sort of normal channel inventory levels, normal levels in general and yet we saw a pretty sharp drop-off in demand in the last part of March. So how do you guys triangulate being “normal” inventory levels when demand seems to be falling off a bit here? One would think that the whole industry should take actions like you guys did and close shop for a week or two and really bring inventory levels down, but it doesn’t seem to be occurring widespread. So I’m just curious on your thoughts there. Thanks. 
John F. Coyne: Let me address the DVR market. I think we’ve made some pretty good progress in our, in the actions that we took last quarter to manage that market and that opportunity and those -- that’s managing product mix, customer mix, and cost. And we are working all of those things and as Tim said in his remarks, I mean, we think this is a very good opportunity area for us to generate profitable growth on a go-forward basis.  Inventory, Tim, do you want to address that, or -- 
Tim Leyden: I do think that the inventory should be managed according to the demand. And I mean, we do have the tools available with the weekly reporting, which happens. So we would be happy if others decide the same sort of discipline in that particular [inaudible] also. 
John F. Coyne: But I think to put things in perspective, you referenced the 2004 situation where the level of inventory build was 2X the current build in terms of percentage of inventory relative to industry sales. So I think we have a little overhang. I think it has reflected itself in a little slower distribution start this quarter.  We don’t actually from the data see that there was any significant reduction in demand in the back half of March. The data indicates that demand was steady. I think the fact that Western Digital's linearity sales was very good left some of our competitors with a bit of a hill to climb in the back-half of March. 
Bob Blair: Is there one more question?
Operator: Robert Marson, your line is open. 
Robert Marson : Thanks for the follow-up. Do you guys know where your products are ending up on a geographical basis? And the reason I ask that is because there is this global infrastructure boom going on in BRIC and other parts of the world -- Brazil, Russia, India, China area and the Middle East, Latin America. Is there any way to gauge the final consumption of your products and how that is going to shift with the increased global growth at the expense of U.S. growth in PC consumption? Thank you. 
John F. Coyne: We get some visibility to that in the distribution channel and retail through our point of sales data. It’s not so clear necessarily in our OEM business where those products finally end up, but what we are seeing in our direct business is a lot of strength in Latin America, in China, in the Eastern European countries, in India. So all of the BRIC economies, we are seeing significant strength there and we believe from talking with customers that that’s -- that the OEMs that we sell to are looking at a similar profile in their businesses. 
Robert Marson : Thank you. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne. 
John F. Coyne:  I would just like to recap the highlights of the call. We are very pleased with our sustained progress against our profitable growth objective year to date. We continue to feel good about the robust demand forecasted for the industry over the next several years and we feel good about WD’s opportunity to continue to prosper by providing compelling solutions to our customers.  With that, I’d like to thank you all for joining us today and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. 
Bob Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; growth opportunities and WD’s strategies to address these opportunities; the planned volume ramp of our 250-gigabit per square inch technology; beliefs regarding our future capital expenditures as a vertically integrated hard drive manufacturer; our growth and pricing expectations; expectations regarding our bridge financing facility and future longer-term financing; and our current financial outlook for the March quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2007, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today.  We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. I will now turn the call over to Western Digital President and CEO, John Coyne. 
John F. Coyne: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. After my remarks, Tim Leyden will review our December quarter performance in detail and address our outlook for the March quarter. A year ago I spoke to you for the first time as CEO and outlined my commitment to continue the pursuit of profitable growth. I am happy to report that our December quarter results complete a calendar year of tremendous achievement by the WD team, a year in which we delivered industry-leading growth and financial performance, and during which we significantly strengthened our technology position and the fundamental WD business model. In calendar 2007, we increased revenues by 38% and earnings per share by 56% compared with calendar 2006. More importantly, we have built momentum throughout the year and we exit the December quarter with revenue up 54% and earnings per share up 137% compared to the same quarter last year.  Additionally, we maintained the financial asset management discipline which is a hallmark of WD, applying our expertise to the newly acquired WD media operation cycle times, and inventories, while also continuing to improve in head and drive operations, resulting in a sequential increase in inventory turns from 12.6 to 14.8.  Hard drive finished goods inventory at the end of December was down 2% year-over-year, while we still achieved 54% revenue growth with consistent and responsive customer support.  Capital spending at $332 million year to date is also disciplined and tracking in line with the previously announced reduction to our annual capital plan. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the entire WD team, the tremendous support of our supply partners, and the increasing preference of our customers for WD’s value proposition.  Our high quality, high reliability products, our flexible and responsive service, our efficient large-scale operations, our investments in technology, capacity and capability, and our commitment to continuous improvement all contributed to these superb 2007 and December quarter results. WD’s performance reflects that of a highly-motivated team operating with passion, taking appropriate and rapid action, focused on productivity, demonstrating relentless perseverance and innovation in technology, products and process, and balancing the needs of our customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate with integrity. Opportunity is being created by a continuing surge in demand for traditional computing-related storage, further enhanced by emerging storage demand driven by rich content distributed over the Internet and personal content arising from the conversion of photography, audio and video from analog to digital technologies.  For calendar 2007, demand for hard drives grew over 15% on a unit basis and 67% in total HDD storage capacity for a total of approximately 88 billion gigabytes of HDD storage. In the December quarter alone, units grew 20% and total HDD storage capacity expanded 70% versus the year ago period. This strong growth in units and total HDD storage capacity is expected to continue for the next several years. WD is capitalizing on growth opportunities through thoughtful strategies which we have executed very effectively in recent years. I would like to briefly highlight a few of these key strategies. Five years ago, we identified that the market for 2.5-inch hard drives would become an increasingly important segment of the overall market. We invested consistently and patiently in people, technology staging, product and process development and entered the market in September 2004. Step-by-step, we began to build applications knowledge, business understanding and customer acceptance. We maintained focus on our technology and reached a point in May of 2007 where we began volume shipments of the 250-gigabyte capacity, the industry’s highest capacity two-disk 2.5-inch drive at that time. In late October, we followed up with our 320-gigabyte capacity, again leading the industry to volume with advanced technology and capacity.  This technology and product leadership is underpinned by high yielding, high quality, low cost design and manufacturing. In the last year, we have tripled our output of mobile drives, shipping 8.7 million 2.5-inch hard drives in the December quarter. Our technology and product momentum in this space, allied to our acknowledged reputation for quality, reliability, availability and responsiveness, bodes well for continued growth in this, the fastest-growing segment of the storage industry.  For many years, Branded Products was a successful but small element of our total product mix, consisting mostly of internal drive upgrade kits for desktop computers. About three years ago, demand in this category began to expand dramatically, driven by Internet content and the conversion of audio, video and photography from analog to digital, allowing consumers to process and store this content on computers and similar devices.  Again, we made timely and appropriate investments in people to understand the emerging market, to design appropriate products, to establish the right channels and partners, and to lead and inspire our teams.  Two years ago, Branded accounted for just 5% of sales. Today, Branded represents 18% of our hard drive revenues and WD is the leading storage appliance brand.  Adding to our presence in the Enterprise SATA market, we launched our Green Power line of drives mid-year and this product concept is finding significant acceptance in the enterprise customer base, addressing the need to reduce the power demands of large commercial storage farms. During 2007 we made three very important, long-term, strategic investments. The first, with the acquisition of Komag, provides the ability to design and manufacture our own media. Just like our head acquisition in 2003, WD Media is playing a key role in driving our future technologies, as well as further improving our cost model and our supply security and flexibility.  The second was an asset purchase of Senvid, a software company, to enable the further broadening and enhancement of our Branded product offerings.  The third involved the opening of a design center in Longmont, Colorado adding a significant new talent pool to the WD engineering team to fuel future growth. We enter 2008 with strong positions and momentum in all our served business segments. We are ramping production of our industry-leading 250-gigabit per square inch technology, first deployed on our 2.5-inch products last October, and now on our 3.5-inch product platforms, creating a common, highly leveraged, efficient, high-volume technology platform for our component and drive operations for the year ahead. We will also see the full impact of our internal media operations as we move through the year. We continue to explore opportunities to broaden our product portfolio in existing markets and to enter new and adjacent market segments as it makes business sense. We are making appropriate investments to stage for these opportunities. Consistent with WD tradition, we will make specific product announcements only when these products are available and shipping in volume. The future for our industry looks bright. Demand for storage capacity is forecast to continue growing at some 60% annually which, when addressed with areal density growth of 40% plus, translates into HDD unit growth in the high teens.  This demand is strong and broad based, with many new applications for our technology. With an appropriate business model, good execution, aggressive cost management, great products and a rational approach to pricing, tremendous value can be created by addressing this surging demand for high capacity storage.  While there may be concern about the impact of macro economic conditions on demand for storage, we have yet to see any effect on actual usage or order rates or on forecasts from our customers. The availability of weekly industry information on inventories, sell-in and sell-thru to all channels enables us and the other industry participants to act swiftly whenever we see an imbalance between demand and supply.  With WD’s high velocity, low inventory supply chain and manufacturing model, we have historically demonstrated an ability to react to both upside opportunities and downside challenges. With our lean, efficient OpEx model and our low cost operations, we have the lowest relative breakeven point among major players in the industry.  As an efficient, vertically integrated company, WD has been able to consistently attain high levels of profitability and return on capital, which has allowed substantial investment in future technologies, products and capacity.  We expect to continue to grow profitably and we will continue to price our products with all customers and in all market segments so as to enable continued investment and the long-term sustainability of our business.  We have the passion, the people, technology, product breadth, manufacturing scale, quality, reliability and customer relationships in place and 2008 offers an unprecedented opportunity for profitable growth in all the business segments which we address.  WD’s positioning has never been better. However, as in the past, our success depends largely on our own execution against the opportunities and challenges that emerge in an ever-changing market. Tim will now provide details of our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. Tim. 
Tim Leyden: Thanks, John. We are very pleased with the results for our December quarter. They reflect crisp and timely execution by the WD team, strong demand for hard drives, and a rational competitive pricing environment.  Our operational flexibility enabled us to quickly react to a number of attractive market and product mix opportunities throughout the quarter. These opportunities continued to arise after our revised guidance in early December, resulting in additional upside. Coupled with continued progress on the integration of our media operations and our ongoing focus on asset efficiency and cash management, these factors led to exceptionally strong revenue, earnings and cash flows in the December quarter.    Revenue for our second fiscal quarter was $2.2 billion. This includes $120 million from external sales of media and substrates. Hard drive revenue was up 46% from the prior year, and hard drive shipments totaled 34.2 million units, up 40% from the prior year.  Average hard drive selling prices were approximately $61 per unit, up $2 from the September quarter and up $3 from the year-ago quarter as a result of firmer pricing, due to the strong demand for hard drives coupled with an improved segment and product mix.  The percentage of our hard drive revenue coming from non-desktop PC applications increased to 54% in the December quarter, as compared to 53% in the September quarter and 42% for the year-ago quarter. We shipped 8.7 million 2.5-inch mobile drives in the December quarter, as compared to 5.9 million in the September quarter and 2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Demand for mobile storage continues to increase and our quality, technology leadership, product offerings, operational flexibility, and responsiveness have solidified our position as a valued partner to PC manufacturers, major distributors and retailers.  In consumer electronics, we shipped 4.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the December quarter versus 3.7 million in the September quarter and 2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This market continues to offer long-term growth opportunities and demonstrates the potential of non-PC based consumer electronics systems incorporating hard drives. However, pricing in the DVR market does not currently provide adequate returns to justify incremental capacity expansion to fully support these growth opportunities.  Desktop product shipments were better than expected. Unit shipments were up 10% from the September quarter as compared to 5% for the market as a whole. During the quarter, while we honored our pre-existing OEM commitments, we focused on satisfying upside demand from the distribution channel first, as desktop OEM margins, like DVR, are less attractive than other market areas. Sales into the enterprise market, our highest margin segment, were in line with our expectations. Continued growth in shipments of hard drives for non-desktop PC applications has led to a substantial improvement in the diversification of our revenue and customer base.  Hard drive channel revenue was 48% OEM, 34% distribution and 18% branded products versus 50% OEM, 31% distribution and 19% branded in the September quarter; and it was 46% OEM, 37% distribution and 17% branded in the year-ago quarter. These percentages exclude external sales of media and substrates, which totaled $120 million in the December quarter, or 5% of revenue, and $40 million in the September quarter, or 2% of revenue.  Revenue for each of our top five customers increased from the September quarter. However, because of the increased diversification of our revenue base, again no single customer comprised more than 10% of the total. The Q2 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 32% Americas, 32% Europe and 36% Asia, as compared to 34% Americas, 33% Europe and 33% Asia in the September quarter; and it was 38% Americas, 32% Europe and 30% Asia in the year-ago quarter. These percentages also exclude external sales of media and substrates. Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 23.3% versus 18.3% in the September quarter and 17.9% in the year-ago quarter. This increase was a function of the favorable industry conditions I referred to earlier and our ability to quickly react to the opportunities for volume increase, pricing and mix optimization presented by this stronger demand.  Our manufacturing throughput and costs also improved through operational efficiencies, higher utilization and a higher mix of products based on newer, more cost-effective technologies and the contribution of media operations.  I am pleased to report that the media acquisition was accretive to the December quarter, our first full quarter of operations. This is two quarters earlier than we originally forecast and is due to higher internal usage, higher external sales and more rapid progress in yield and utilization than originally contemplated.    Operating expenses totaled $181 million, or 8.2% of revenue. This includes a full quarter of media operating expenses, continued investments in product and technology improvements, and higher incentive compensation associated with the more favorable financial results for the quarter. Operating income was $332 million, or 15% of revenue. Net interest and other non-operating costs netted to an expense of approximately $16 million. This includes about $8 million of losses on our investments in auction-rate securities, which I will discuss later.  Income tax expense was $11 million for the December quarter, or approximately 3.5% of income before taxes. This includes the benefit of adjusting our year-to-date rate down to approximately 4.5%, excluding the Q1 non-recurring items. We now expect our rate for the full year will be in the 4% to 6% range.  Net income totaled $305 million, or $1.35 per share. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $967 million as compared to $851 million at the end of September.  Cash generated from operations during the quarter totaled $519 million.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $169 million, and non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $111 million. For the first six months of 2008, our capital expenditures totaled $332 million, approximately $100 million of which relates to our 8-inch wafer fab conversion. We still expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to be around $700 million, which is consistent with the reduced capital plan that we communicated to you during our first quarter earnings call on November 1st, despite significant increases in our volume.  As previously indicated, this includes about $200 million for conversion of our head wafer fabrication facility and $100 million to upgrade our media technology. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2008 is expected to be about $400 million, including about $100 million for media operations. During the quarter, we retired the $250 million convertible debt assumed in the Komag acquisition through cash payments of $240 million and a further draw on our bridge financing facility of $10 million. As of the end of December, we had $760 million outstanding under our bridge financing facility. We are in the process of obtaining longer-term, unsecured financing that we expect will consist of a 5-year term loan and a revolving line of credit totaling $500 million to $750 million.  As of today, we have received non-binding commitments totaling in excess of $700 million. We expect to pay off the $760 million outstanding under the bridge financing facility through a combination of these loan proceeds and existing cash balances. This refinancing transaction is being led by JPMorgan and Citibank. Our cash and cash equivalents of $917 million are invested primarily in readily accessible, AAA rated institutional money-market funds, the majority of which are backed by the U.S. government.  As of the end of December, our short-term investments of $50 million included $43 million of AAA rated auction-rate securities. During the December quarter, the market values of some of the auction-rate securities we owned as of the beginning of the quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions. We reduced our investments in auction-rate securities from $197 million at the beginning of the quarter to $43 million as of the end of the quarter. As a result of these market value changes, we realized $3 million in losses on sales and $5 million of unrealized losses to mark the remaining investments to market.  Since quarter-end, we have sold an additional $10 million at par, bringing our current net balance of auction-rate securities down to $33 million. These securities will likely be held for some period of time, until secondary markets become available. These investments are currently accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The market values of these investments are subject to fluctuation. At the end of each quarter, we will evaluate any changes in value to determine if they are temporary or permanent. Temporary changes are recorded in equity, while changes believed to be permanent are booked to the income statement. We did not repurchase any common stock during the December quarter. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 15.1 million shares at a total cost of $204 million, for an average price of $13.53 per share; $46 million remains under our existing stock repurchase authorization.  Our cash conversion cycle was a positive four days, consisting of 45 days of receivables, 25 days of inventory, or 15 turns, and 66 days of payables outstanding.  Now, I will move on to our expectations for the third quarter of 2008.  We expect total revenues of between $1.925 billion and $2 billion. This represents an increase of between 37% and 42% over the prior year period. This revenue range includes $50 million from sales of media and substrates to external customers, down from $120 million in the December quarter as we complete our obligations to supply external customers.  Historically, drive demand goes down sequentially from December to March by from 3% to 5%. However, demand for the December quarter was unusually strong for the industry. We grew volume, mix and pricing as a result of our ability to quickly react to this demand strength, our leadership position in certain markets, and significant productivity improvements achieved in the quarter. We view this combination of circumstances as extraordinary and unlikely to fully repeat in the March quarter. Accordingly, we are currently modeling a sequential decrease in the range of 6% to 10% in our hard disk drive revenue for the March quarter. As a consequence of the strength of demand and rational behavior in the second half of calendar 2007, the hard drive industry appears to have achieved an overall uplift in margins by all major participants. Our results demonstrate the profit potential for those companies with an effective cost structure who execute well, where all industry participants focus on profitability, cash generation and demand/supply management. Also, we continue to believe that our blended internal and external media supply model will deliver cost improvements at the gross margin line of up to 300 basis points by the end of calendar 2008.  The accelerated progress of our media integration, our changing segment mix, and an expectation of continued rational market behavior now enables us to reset our gross margin model from our historical 15% to 20% range up to the 18% to 23% range. Gross margin for the March quarter is anticipated to be in the middle of our revised model, at approximately 20%. While this is down from the December quarter, it is up significantly from the 15.8% gross margin we reported for the March quarter of 2007.  Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $175 million as we continue to invest in expanding our product and technology portfolio. Net interest expense is projected to be about $8 million, assuming no further investment losses. We anticipate our tax rate to be in the range of 4% to 6% of pretax income and our share count will be about 227 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.85 and $0.91 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Mark Miller. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Congratulations on a wonderful job done. It’s very impressive to me. I just wanted to talk a little more about Komag, and you say there’s still more room for margin improvement as we go through to the end of the year. What are you estimate that Komag being accretive this quarter added to your margins? Was it around 75, 100 basis points?
Tim Leyden: About 80 basis points. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Okay. Second question; was there any change -- did you do more heads internally this quarter or was that flat roughly quarter to quarter in terms of percentage of total heads you did internally versus externally?
John F. Coyne: I think roughly on a percentage basis, roughly flat from the prior quarter. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: Okay. Could you just break down the inventory for me? I know it’s up somewhat. It’s not unusual but could you break it down? And maybe you did that and I missed it in terms of finished goods and raw materials and work in progress. 
Tim Leyden: Actually, our inventory turns improved from 13 to 15 in the quarter and finished goods were up from 151 up to 157 million, but as we indicated, that’s actually down from the same period last year. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.: All right. Again, wonderful job. Thank you. 
Operator: Richard Kugele.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Thanks a lot and I guess first, since it will affect your gross margin and my model, is Komag actually able to help you on some of these newer areal densities you are announcing, at least in the desktop side? Or are you buying those parts on the outside and using Komag for more the mainstream?
John F. Coyne: Rich, we’re both in the June or May and October 2.5-inch programs and in the 3.5-inch 320-gig per platter that we just announced, we have capability on both our internal heads and media, as well as capability from our external suppliers. So we use a blend of both. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and then from a capacity standpoint, how long -- I guess a lot of the $100 million you’ve spent to date has really been just on bringing the media business up to a greater percentage perpendicular, but how long do you think it will be before you actually have to add capacity on that side?
John F. Coyne: Some time, given that we expect to -- and the 300 basis point full year contribution on the cost side is driven from an expectation of yield utilization and throughput, increased capability from focus on a much narrower set of products. And we experienced, if you’ll recall, in the 2003-2004 experience of ramping the internal head capability, that a very significant contribution on yield and throughput capability came from rationalizing the product mix. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much and well done. 
Operator: Richard Kaiser.
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: I just wanted to inquire about a couple of comments you made pertaining to high velocity and high visibility. Historically in the storage disk drive markets, there have been a lot of volatility around pricing associated in part because of the distributor channel and I wanted to get your sense for if that has changed or not. You seemed in your comments to talk about more stability, more rational behavior, all major players. I just wondered if you could provide some color on that. 
John F. Coyne: Yes, I think over the years, the reporting from the distribution channel has been significantly improved in terms of its timeliness and overall encompassing of the entire distribution set worldwide. Recognize also at the same time the number of drive companies has reduced significantly and the concentration of product through large distributors has increased.  So total visibility in the entire distribution channel has improved dramatically over the past several years. We now have visibility to sell in and point of sale data, as well as of course visibility to manufacturing inventories servicing the large OEMs on a weekly basis for the entire industry, and all industry participants have access to that data.  I think our ability to manage demand and match with supply has been dramatically improved over the last several years. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up; there was something I didn’t quite understand. It was a comment with respect to pricing, I think it was, of DVR and it did not warrant additional investment. Could you just clarify what you meant there? I’m sorry, I missed that. 
Tim Leyden: That market is a bit below the set of returns that we would like to see and what we are doing about it is where it’s a two-sided proposition. We are obviously going to work on our costs in order to make it more attractive to the customers. We are also going to work with the customers in order to make sure that they are aware and value our value proposition that we bring to the table.  So really what we are saying is that we are directing our capacity to the more profitable segments and parts of the business and that one is below what we would like to see. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Great. Just one final question, if I might, and that is now you’ve made a point about how the business model is much more diversified and this gives you more flexibility and I’m just wondering if, in the context of consumer spending, we should also see that as a greater risk here. 
John F. Coyne: I don’t believe so. I mean, if you look at the overall market data, typically most weight is given to the behavior of the IT and computing segment as it relates to potential hard drive sales. If you look at 2007 data, roughly 300 million PC systems shipped in 2007, while 500 million hard drives were shipped in 2007, so we’re getting an increase, a significant increase in the level of demand for large capacity storage devices that are not linked directly to the sales rate of PCs or industrial computing applications. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Great. Thank you. 
John F. Coyne: I think that augers very well for balance and opportunity as we look forward. 
Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thank you. 
Operator: David Bailey. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions, if I may; the first, could you comment on how much capacity you are adding this year? And do you have any idea what the expectations are for the industry versus that sort of mid- to high-teens unit growth that you are expecting?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think our observations relative to industry capital, Seagate announced last week their intention to be very disciplined and frugal in relation to capacity investment. I think we’ve just reconfirmed that our capital plan, which we reduced by $50 million from 750 to 700 in our last call, that we’re sitting on the lower end, the 700 guide for our capital for the full year. So we are taking a very measured approach to capacity.  The good thing is that the improved visibility we have into the demand and inventories in all channels gives us a much better informed base from which to make our capital decisions. We have also worked very hard in the past few years with our capital equipment suppliers, particularly as it relates to drive assembly capability and drive test capability, to shorten lead times so that we can react much closer to the visibility to true demand. And I think you’ve seen and the 2007 performance reflects all of those improvements in both visibility and execution of matching supply capacity to true demand. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: And just to follow up on that on the visibility side, is your visibility longer range or is it more just a better idea of what’s going on in the short-term?
John F. Coyne: I think it’s a combination of the two. I mean, on a long range basis, we’re looking at the fundamental underlying drivers that are generating the 67% demand profile that we’ve seen over the last couple of years for billions of gigabytes of storage.  As we come closer in to customer forecasts, customer orders, inventory levels, we have the ability to look at how we should match against that emerging short to medium term demand profile. And the other element that has helped in this regard is that as the late 2006, early 2007 returns in the industry were inadequate to fund aggressive investment looking at capacity going forward.  Our OEM customers are beginning to realize the need to be more longer term in their views, and so we’ve seen a number of our OEM customers entering into multi-quarter agreements with us now to secure that most critical of all items, which is availability, to support their business plans. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Steven Fox.
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: I was wondering, just looking at your outlook if you could talk about what you think happens to your branded sales as you go into the March quarter, since there’s not a lot of history there? What are your retail customers telling you? And then secondly, just getting back to that DVR comment, can you sort of quantify what that means in terms of your unit outlook going forward? Does it mean you hold steady at current levels or actually grow at a lower rate? I’m just trying to get a better feel for that. 
John F. Coyne: Let me deal with branded first. The first calendar quarter is typically a strong quarter for branded products, particularly January/February period where we get a gift certificate redemption kind of boost to the market after the Christmas shopping period.  What we are hearing from our retailers right now is that although they have some challenges, storage and particularly WD-branded storage is a very bright spot for them in terms of their retail sales in the stores, so we’re very encouraged by what we see so far in the quarter. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Thanks, and then on the -- 
John F. Coyne: The second part of the question was the CE space, the DVR. Again, the typical seasonality there is that it falls off significantly into the first calendar quarter, so typically volumes are down quarter to quarter.  Our comment relative to margin contribution is more a question of what kind of capacity we put in place to support the July through December period next year, in 2008. 
Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Sherri Scribner.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: I just wanted to explore a little bit more into your out-performance in the notebook side of the business. Do you feel like that’s OEMs coming to you because you have a superior areal density product or because you have a superior quality product? Can you maybe give a little detail there?
John F. Coyne: All of the above, Sherri. I think the really interesting observation is that the vast majority of the notebook marketplace is still seeking increased storage capacity. Case in point -- the latest IDC preliminary data for the December quarter indicates that SSDs shipped in notebook computers reached some quantity short of 5,000 units for the entire quarter. Hard drive of capacities of 250-gigabytes and 320-gigabytes shipped over 3.25 million units, of which WD supplied the majority. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great and then -- 
John F. Coyne: Technology is important in this marketplace -- good, high capacities are important in this marketplace and of course, you must deliver that leading edge technology with high reliability and high quality as a given. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of if I look at your share now, I mean, you’ve gained significant share Q-over-Q, probably somewhere approaching 20% share of the notebook market. There’s a lot of players in that market. Do you think that you are tapped out in terms of future share gains? How much share do you really think you can get beyond where you are right now?
John F. Coyne: Well, that will be an outcome for our customers to decide. All things being equal, you would think that with six players, there’d be one-sixth of the market for each. However, all things are never equal and our opportunity in that market is down to our ability to execute and to continue to delight customers with the right products that suit their product plans, and I believe we are very well-positioned to keep delighting our customers in that space. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, maybe just quickly, do you have any -- what do you think about these three-platter notebook drives that are coming out at 500-gigabytes capacity? Do you think there’s demand there? Do you think there’s any issues with those drives?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think the -- as we do, I think it’s a strong endorsement of the view that there is a strong appetite for high-capacity solutions, both in the notebook and in the portable branded product space for 2.5-inch drives. So that’s the really good news.  As I mentioned when I was talking about WD's future plans relative to markets, we announce products when we are shipping them in volume and we will continue to follow that practice. We will support our customers in meeting that currently insatiable appetite for large capacity drives for the notebook space. 
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Mark Moskowitz.
Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan: This is Anthony [Lescrit] for Mark Moskowitz. Going back to the branded business, can you contrast the relative strength in the European versus the U.S. markets and what have you seen through January thus far? 
John F. Coyne: I think we are doing well in both geographies and consistent with our expectations relative to the seasonal patterns we have observed over the last couple of years. 
Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan: Okay, and going forward, how much of the channel in OEM replenishment is supporting guidance for the March quarter, given the low base exiting December?
John F. Coyne: We don’t really look at our replenishment in terms of -- we’re happy with where the inventories are today. If I look at the total industry inventories, and that would be manufacturers inventory that we have in our own facilities and in the customer OEM JIT hubs and in transit, and I look at the channel inventories that our distributors hold on an industry-wide statement, on a combination of 2.5 and 3.5 SATA and PATA drives, which is the served market for WD, the days of inventory for the entire industry supply chain were down 11% year over year as of the end of December, and as of the beginning of week three of the current quarter, we are down 13% on a year-over-year basis.  So I think the industry is manufacturing at a rate that is in very good synchronization with the actual demand. I think the inventories are in a very good place and so WD is pretty happy with the environment right now from an inventory supply management perspective. 
Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan: Okay, thanks and one last question -- what was your capacity utilization exiting the quarter and expectation for March? Thanks. 
John F. Coyne: Well, pretty full last quarter. We basically ran hot all quarter long and mixed to the best opportunities we could find in the demand space. We did not satisfy all available demand. Consequently, we expect to run pretty good utilizations through the March quarter. And understand under WD's model, we feel no compulsion to run our factories flat out. We run them efficiently. We take appropriate action to match hours worked and manning to demand levels but we do not need to run at 100% utilization to make money. In fact, we can run very significantly lower levels with that, so we match our supply to the demand that we see and we get visibility of that demand on a weekly basis and we’ll take appropriate actions. 
Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Aaron Rakers.
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the clean quarter. I would like to dive a little bit deeper into the gross margin line. You had said that 80 basis points from the Komag acquisition -- it would be very helpful to understand where the remaining sequential 420 basis points came from, be it mixed shift in terms of capacities.  What I’m trying to get to is if I look at the mix of business towards mobile, are we starting to see mobile carry a better-than-average gross margin for the company? 
Tim Leyden: Yes, you are, Aaron. If you look at what we’ve already indicated, enterprise is our highest margin product. Branded products is our next highest margin product and notebook comes pretty closely after that. And then there’s a bit of a gap between desktop and consumer electronics. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : And so with that being said, as we roll into this next quarter, that 20% guidance roughly, that is factoring -- correct me if I’m wrong, you’re saying 300 basis points by the end of the year from Komag split across these next two quarters. With that being said, are you being a little bit cautious and seeing that come back due to pricing or why are you seeing that come back a little bit?
Tim Leyden: Actually, the difference between the 80 basis points and the 300 basis points is actually spread over four quarters because it’s the end of calendar --
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Okay, that’s good. Thanks for the clarification. And I guess the other thing is on the channel inventory trends, where are you at in terms of weeks of channel inventory for yourself and relative to that to the industry?
John F. Coyne: We are sitting above the midpoint of our four to six week range. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Okay. Thank you very much. 
Tim Leyden: Actually, on the four to six week range there, we will -- as we look at that, we are currently combining in that number both the bulk distribution and the branded products pipeline. So as branded products becomes a large amount of business for the industry and for ourselves, it’s likely that we will have to split that out going forward because the pipeline for branded product is in the seven to nine week range and the distribution bulk is in the four to six weeks range. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : A final question, if I can jump in real quick; given your comments earlier, are you implying that for your notebook business -- what’s your average capacity for your notebook drives right now relative -- I believe Seagate told us that it was somewhere around 135. I’m trying to understand how much you are benefiting from just the technology leadership in that space. 
Tim Leyden: We don’t publish what the average mix is but I will tell you that we did have a rich mix for the quarter and as we go into the next quarter, we don’t anticipate that that mix will be as rich because it will probably gravitate more towards the industry mix as there will be more participants in that, providing the higher capacity drives. 
Aaron Rakers - Wachovia : Okay. Thank you, guys. 
Operator: Jeff Brickman.
Jeff Brickman - UBS: I just wanted to ask a little more on the branded business. What do you see out there from the competition? And I guess more specifically, what advantages do you think you have that clearly have led to this solid growth? And do you think going forward that you can maintain a share position similar to what you see out there today?
John F. Coyne: Well, I think the advantages we have were an early start, very good industrial design, and very good ease of use software and product configuration, and very healthy relationships with our partners in the channels that take us to market. So we’ve got a very strong position, very well-recognized by the consumer and we’re going to continue to try to capitalize on those strengths as we move forward here. 
Jeff Brickman - UBS: And do you see anything from the competition, or anything new out there that makes you think that it might be more challenging to maintain what appears to be a very high level of market share going forward?
John F. Coyne: Well, I mean, competition is always tough in this business but we’re frankly more focused on the opportunities and the kinds of products and the markets and geographies and partners that we need to be choosing in order to sustain growth in that market and accelerate growth in that market than we are looking in the rear-view mirror to see who’s behind us. 
Jeff Brickman - UBS: Understood. And then, over on the competitive side in general, did you see anything in the way of increased price aggression at all towards the end of the year, or so far in this quarter, in January?
Tim Leyden: What we are seeing really in January so far is normal, typical pricing behavior. I mean, it’s always a tougher quarter than the Q2 quarter and we’re seeing exactly what we expect at this particular point. 
Jeff Brickman - UBS: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator: Keith Bachman.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Tim, to follow the last question, what are your like-for-like pricing assumptions for the March quarter?
Tim Leyden: We don’t actually give out like-for-like pricing but as I indicated, we’re expecting typical seasonal type of price decline, and that’s what we are seeing so far. 
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Seagate -- on the notebook side, Seagate has the 250-gig notebook that they are shipping now. As you guys, you wouldn’t answer the previous question on your capacity points on the 2.5-inch, but can you indicate whether off of such a high base that you anticipate maintaining share this quarter, losing a little share, gaining share on the 2.5-inch side on a sequential basis?
John F. Coyne: Well, as I indicated, we’ve been shipping the 250-gigabyte capacity since May of last year and have a substantial share in the 250. And we do expect to have, as more people join with the capability to address that capacity point, we do expect to see some pressure there. However, we now have since October the 320-gigabyte capacity, which gives us the opportunity to satisfy our customers’ needs, to continue to increase the product offering in terms of the storage capacity that they can offer in their high-end product mix.  And so we are baking into our numbers the expectation that there will be other competitors at the 250-gigabyte capacity point, but we are expecting that we will see a significant move up to 320. We’ve already begun to see that happen. 
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, so 320 is still at a competitive advantage in your eyes for Western Dig?
John F. Coyne: Absolutely. 
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Tim, one last one for me -- rich cash flow this quarter. Your debt level is at 770-something and change. I know you are refining everything but as you think about the next three quarters, how will you think about applying the cash to pay down the debt versus growing the cash balance? How should we be thinking about the debt balances as we roll forward?
Tim Leyden: Well, it’s a term loan which gives us -- we’ll have a mix of revolver and term loan, and we are obviously -- we haven’t figured out yet how much of the refinancing is going to be revolver. We are still in negotiations with the banks about that but I mean, it will be -- what we will do as always is we will figure out what the most appropriate structure is and continue to take advantage of opportunities. Maybe if the share price, we still have $46 million left in the share repurchase authorization and if the opportunity presents itself and the market continues to give the sort of opportunities -- the macroeconomic market, I’m talking about -- continues to give the opportunities there, we would be opportunistic relative to buying back shares.  
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Interesting. Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Joel Inman.
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Can you talk a little bit about opportunities for further expansion in the enterprise market, with maybe new protocols or new product offerings?
John F. Coyne: We have indicated that we have strong growth opportunities in all the currently served markets and those opportunities arise through the growth of those markets, as well as the opportunity to out-execute on quality, reliability, and customer service and products. And we’ve also indicated that there are other parts of the market -- gaming, high performance enterprise -- where we don’t currently compete and that it is our intention over time to be a full line supplier to the industry.  Outside of that, we’ll announce products as we ship them. 
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up; can you give us some idea of the Komag revenue wind-down over the course of this year?
Tim Leyden: As we indicated, it will be -- we are forecasting it to be $50 million this quarter and after that, it will be so insignificant that we won’t be breaking it out. 
Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: [Jayhin Garani].
Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor’s: Just a couple of housekeeping I think I missed -- on the channel breakout for the December quarter, could you just tell me what the disti and the OEM was, please?
Tim Leyden: OEM was 48%, distributors was 34%, and retail was 18%. 
Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor’s: Right, and then I just wanted to get your impression. You did mention SSDs and the units shipped, the IDC number. We also heard from EMC about incorporating an SSD drive, an enterprise SSD drive. What is your view on that and give me some color on what you think about that?
John F. Coyne: I think the -- I think both of the areas where SSDs have shown up so far are valid niche markets. But they are niche markets and it’s a significant endorsement to see EMC bring out a product at the very high end of the performance spectrum. But recognize of the 8 million or so drives shipped into that enterprise space, less than 2 million are addressing high performance in that category of performance, and this SSD announcement is a small slice of that small slice.  So it’s a niche application which offers some opportunity for system designers to tune performance. 
Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor’s: Okay, but longer term, what would you have to see to even consider that technology to be something that you would address?
John F. Coyne: As those niche applications grow, and I’m confident they will grow, we look at -- if you look at the characteristics, Flash is media. You have to then match that up with a controller and applications knowledge and knowledge of how to put that whole thing together in a reliable way to make it look and behave like a hard drive, which is the application.  And so who better to take media and integrate it and ship it into a market where there is deep experience and knowledge of the application than the hard drive companies. So as we see that market becoming large enough to justify the engineering investments, it’s highly likely that you will see WD and other drive manufacturers address that market segment. 
Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor’s: I guess what I was trying to determine, and maybe you did give me some hint about that, is how much of an engineering effort, if you will, does it take for you to get there versus the IP that you already have in-house? Or is it something you can go out and buy?
John F. Coyne: Be aware that in 1989, Western Digital was shipping SSDs in partnership with SunDisk, which was a precursor to the current SanDisk, so there is a significant body of knowledge relative to how to take solid state media and incorporate it in a drive product. 
Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor’s: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you and our last question comes from Richard Kugele.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Thanks for the quick follow-up here. Two quick ones; seasonality, what are your expectations for the industry in the first quarter? I know you are talking about if the December was an out-size quarter for you that perhaps your sequential will be a little bit greater. We’ll see if that plays out but in terms of the industry expectations, what are your thoughts there for the first quarter?
Tim Leyden: We’re anticipating 3% to 5% reduction in the TAM quarter-on-quarter. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and then lastly, since you brought it up about break-even being lowest in the industry, I know Seagate has made public comments that theirs is now down to 12% to 13% gross margin, that they would be able to break even. Do you have any comments on where we should be thinking yours is post Komag?
Tim Leyden: Not really, no. 
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne. 
John F. Coyne: Thank you, Operator. In closing, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I’d also like to thank again our employees, our suppliers, and our customers for an outstanding December quarter and we look forward to updating you on progress as we execute our strategies and address the vast opportunities we see ahead of us in the storage market. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to Western Digital's first quarter financialresults for fiscal year 2008. (Operator instructions) Now I will turn the callover to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.
Bob Blair: Thank you. As we begin, I would like to remind you that wewill be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response toyour questions concerning our expectations regarding supply and demandconditions in the hard drives industry; growth in the market for hard drives;and growth opportunities for WD; the effects of strong seasonality in theDecember quarter; our plans to continue investing in new technologies andproduct road maps; our beliefs regarding the benefits of a vertically integratedhard drive business; our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2008; and ourcurrent financial outlook for the December quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management'scurrent expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that couldcause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Form10-K filed with the SEC on August 28, 2007, as well as the additional riskfactors reported in this press release included as Exhibit 99.1 in the Form 10-K, we furnishedto the SEC tonight. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-lookingstatements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assumelater in the quarter, that the comments we make today are still valid. In addition, references will be made during this call tonon-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review these non-GAAPfinancial measures, as well as the reconciliation of these measures to thecomparable GAAP results on the last page of our press release, financialstatements included as Exhibit 99.1 to the form we furnished to the SEC today,a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the investorrelation's section of our website at www.westerndigital.com.  I would now like toturn the call over to Western Digital’s President and Chief Executive OfficerJohn Coyne. 
John Coyne: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me todayis Tim Leyden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After myremarks, Tim will provide the financial report on our first quarter and ouroutlook for the second quarter. Our financial results for the first quarterreflect a continuation of our profitable growth in a strong market environmentthroughout the quarter.  The September quarter was unusual in that we saw strongindustry demand emerge early in the quarter, and sustain throughout. This wastrue in all geographic regions, markets and channels that we serve.  With public reporting of quarterly financials in the harddrive industry now completed, it is clear that the improved demand combinedwith disciplined production increases allowed more stable pricing, whichresulted in an improved industry-wide financial performance.  Through October, industry conditions have been seasonallystrong. We believe that growth of 12% to 15% year over year and 4% to 5% quarterover quarter is likely in the December quarter. Distribution and manufacturers inventoriescombined are down year over year by some of 11% exiting October. Based on current demand and factory build rates,we believe that the industry would be much better positioned entering theJanuary to March quarters than in recent years. At WD, our capacity is constrained relative to currentdemand. As a result, we are working diligently to treat all customers fairly inthis constrained environment. We expect that we will see allocation on certaincapacities continue through out the quarter.  In the first quarter, our investment strategy, productportfolio and execution in all market segments enabled us to address robustdemand for mainstream and high capacity hard drives in both consumer andcommercial applications.  We posted year-over-year hard drive growth of 37% inrevenues and 29% in unit shipments. Combined with our solid performance in theMarch and June quarters, the WD business model has demonstrated our ability todeliver strong results in both good times and in the periods where we faceindustry headwinds.  Each of WD's businesses – desktop, consumer electronics,branded products, mobile and enterprise SATA -- turned in strong performancesin Q1. As a result of our multi-year diversification strategy, for the firsttime we derived more than half of our quarterly revenues in the hard drivespace from non-desktop applications, 53%, up from 35% in the year-ago quarter. This greater diversification of our revenue base is a resultof the investments made and our execution of the new product plan over the lastseveral years, during which time we have become the world’s second-largestmaker of hard drives.  The breadth of applications for hard drives is a majorbenefit for the industry and especially for those of us who have the ability tocontinue investing in future technologies and product roadmaps.  The company's unit shipments for the first quarter includedapproximately 5.9 million 2.5 inchmobile hard drives, up 175% year over year and approximately 3.7 million 3.5 inch hard drives for use indigital video recorders, an increase of 51% year over year. Branded products revenue, which increased 133%year over year, accounted for 18% of the Q1 total, continuing to demonstratethe strength of WD's global brand.  We addressed strong demand for higher capacity points ineach of our segments with hard drives based on our own PMR technology. Mostnotably, our 2.5 inch,250GB WD Scorpio hard drives and our 3.5 inch WD Green Power 1TB drives. Both of these drivefamilies are based on our industry leading 200GB per square inch PMR technologyplatforms. Earlier this week, we began shipping anotherindustry-leading product. Our current generation PMR WD Scorpio mobile drive,based on our own 250GB per square inch PMR technology in capacities of up to320GB.  Turning to our media acquisition, integration of the mediaoperation is proceeding smoothly, according to plan. We recently completed ourfirst worldwide operations review in Asia, involving themedia team along with the rest of the WD operations and engineering teams. Weare very excited about our ability to capture the synergies and advantages of avertically integrated hard drive business, thus enabling us to compete evenmore effectively on the basis of our quality, reliability, customer service,technology and execution as we address the tremendous opportunities forprofitable growth in the storage marketplace. Tim Leyden will now provide our financial report andoutlook. 
Timothy Leyden: Thanks, John. Western Digital's execution and revenuediversification strategy, coupled with strong hard drive demand and stablepricing enabled the company to deliver outstanding financial results. Revenuefor our first fiscal quarter was $1.766 billion. This includes $40 million ofrevenue from external sales of media and substrate components, shipped in theperiod between September 5 and September 28.  Total revenue was up 40% from the prior year, and hard driveshipments total 29.4 million units up 29% from the prior year. Average harddrive selling prices were approximately $59 per unit, up $3 from the year-agoquarter, and $4 from the June quarter as a result of firmer pricing andimproved product mix. We shipped 5.9 million 2.5 inch mobile drives in theSeptember quarter, as compared to 2.2 million in the year-ago quarter and 3.8million in the June quarter. Our growth in this important segment demonstratesthe continued acceptance of our leadership products by notebook PC manufacturers,together with increasing demand in the mobile storage appliance market. Turning to consumer electronics, we shipped approximately3.7 million 3.5 inchdrives for use in digital video recorder in the September quarter, versus 2.5million in the year-ago quarter and 2.7 million in the June quarter. Thismarket continues to be a long-term growth opportunity for WD and the industry. Channel revenue was 51% OEM, 31% distribution and 18%branded products versus 52% OEM, 37% distribution, and 11% branded products inthe year-ago quarter. There was 47% OEM, 36% distribution, and 17% brandedproducts in the June quarter.  The Q1 OEM revenue percentage includes $40 million, or 2%,from external sales of media and substrates. Revenue for each of our top fivecustomers increased from the June quarter. However, because of the increaseddiversification of our revenue base, no single customer comprised more than 10%of the total. The Q1 geographic split of our business was 33% Americas,32% Europe, and 35% Asia ascompared to 35% Americas,28% Europe, and 37% Asia in theyear-ago quarter. It was 40% Americas,26% Europe and 34% Asia in theJune quarter. Revenue from external sales of media and substrates is includedin the Asia percentage.  Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 18.3% versus17.3% in the year-ago quarter, and 15% in the June quarter, reflectingimprovements in pricing, mix, and costs.  Operating expenses totaled $188 million, including a $49million charge for in-process research and development related to the Komagacquisition.  Operating income was a $135 million or 7.6% of revenue. Netinterest and other income totaled approximately $3 million. Income tax expense was $69 million for theSeptember quarter, including net non-recurring charges of $60 million. Absentthese charges, our tax rate was about 6.5% for the quarter.  During the September quarter, we had $3 million favorableresolution of certain foreign tax contingencies. Also during the quarter, welicensed certain intellectual property to one of our international subsidiaries.This resulted in a tax charge of $63 million. We now expect that our futurebook tax rate will be in the 5% to 7% range. However, I would highlight thatour cash tax rate will continue to range between 2% and 3% for the foreseeablefuture.  During the quarter, we adopted FIN- 48, which prescribes themethod by which company should calculate reserves for tax contingencies. Theimpact of that adoption was not material to net income or shareholders’equity. However, it did result inbalance sheet reclassifications between deferred tax assets and liabilities. GAAP net income totaled $69 million or $0.31 per share,excluding the $60 million net tax charge, non-GAAP consolidated net income was$129 million or $0.58 per share. Excluding the net tax charge and the combinedimpacts of the acquisition, non-GAAP HDD net income was a $182 million or $0.81per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results is on the last page ofour press release, financial statements.  Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and short-terminvestments at the end of the quarter totaled $851 million as compared to $907million at end of June. The decrease is primarily the result of the net cashused for the acquisition. As of the end of the quarter, we have drawn down $750million of our $1.25 billion bridge facility. Cash generated from operations during the quarter totaled$219 million; capital expenditures for the quarter where $163 million; non-cashcharges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $78 million.  Following a recent review of demand, capacity, technologyand efficiency roadmaps, capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are now expectedto be around $700 million, at the lower end of our previously estimated range.This includes about $100 million for our media operations. Depreciation andamortization expense for fiscal 2008 is expected to be about $400 million,including about $100 million for media operations. We have completed the preliminary purchase price allocationrelated to our $1 billion acquisition of Komag. We recorded a $49 million cashfor in-process research and development. In addition, we increased the bookvalue of the media fixed assets by about $130 million and recordedapproximately $100 million in net deferred tax assets; $90 million ofamortizable intangibles; and $85 million of goodwill.  The asset valuation assessments indicated longer useful livesthan we had initially estimated. As a result, the incremental depreciation andamortization resulting from these fair value adjustments would be about $5million per quarter. This is includedthe $100 million fiscal 2008 estimates of media depreciation and amortizationreferred to above.  During the quarter, we repurchased 841,000 shares of stockat a total cost of about $16 million. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 15.1million shares at a total cost of $204 million; $46 million remains under ourexisting stock repurchase authorization. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive ten days,consisting of 51 days of receivables, 29 days of inventory or 13 turns, and 70days of payables outstanding. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, ourconversion cycle would have been a positive one day, consisting of 48 days ofreceivables, 17 days of inventory or 21 turns, and 64 days of payables outstanding. Now I will move on to our expectations for the secondquarter 2008. It is our intention to break out revenue from a media sales for theDecember and March quarters, until our external obligations are complete. Allother operating results will be reported on a WD consolidated basis.  As we indicated on our last call, we expect the mediaacquisition to become accretive in the June 2008 quarter. Longer term, from theend of calendar 2008, we expect that our blended media internal and externalsupply model will enable us to realize cost improvement at the gross marginline of up to 300 basis points. We expect demand for the December quarter to be seasonallystrong; accordingly, we estimate revenue for the December quarter to be between$1.875 billion and $1.925 billion, including approximately $100 million fromexternal sales of media and substrate. Gross margin for the December quarter is anticipated to bein the range of 18.5% to 19%. Operating expenses are projected to beapproximately $163 million, as we continue to integrate media operations andinvest in expanding our product and technology portfolio.  Net interest expense is projected to be about $11 million.We anticipate a tax rate of between 5% and 7%, and our share count will beabout 225 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.73and $0.77 for the December quarter.  Operator, we are now open for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Andrew Neff – Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff – BearStearns: I wanted to take a step back. You had a really nice quarter,things are going well. Why won’t the industrygo back to – since things are so strong – over building? You are implying thatyou think things might be better in January and March. What is different thistime? How can it be sustainable, and how can we, as investors, feel comfortableabout that?
John Coyne:  Andy, there are several positive indicators. One of those isthat as we exited the first financial quarter, the September quarter,inventories excluding enterprise -- 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch drives -- inventories were down 8% year-over-year aswe exited the September quarter, for the total industry. That is manufacturersinventory, product in transit from the plants, product in the OEM hubs, anddistribution owned inventory throughout the world. So that was, in absolutenumbers, was 8% lower exiting September this year than the prior year.  As of the end of October, it was 11% lower than it was exitingOctober last year. So I think we're seeing significant production discipline. Idon't think that's an accident. I thinkit's a reflection of the way the management teams in the large companies arelooking at their businesses. I believethat discipline maintained through the balance of this quarter will ensure thatwe enter January in the best position relative to supply and demand balance andstarting inventory that we will have seen in the last five years.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey – Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey –Goldman Sachs:  There has been a lot of comment about double ordering fromthe semi companies into the PC space. Why haven’t we seen this yet in the harddrive space, and what evidence do you have that some of the most egregiousprices won’t back off a little bit?
John Coyne:   I think my answer to the prior question is part of it. Imean, our inventory positions are low throughout the industry. Our visibility,particularly in the distribution channel, to the movement of product throughthat channel, the inventories in the channel is very much better than it wasyears ago. Our visibility into the OEM pulls and build rates is alsosignificantly better than it was some years ago; our view of the market todayis that we’re seeing true demand.
David Bailey –Goldman Sachs: A clarification, can you help us understand how much of yourCapEx is going toward capacity expansion and how much of it is for maintenanceat this point?
Timothy Leyden:  Most of our expenditure at the moment is going on componentexpansion, which is HDS and media, and it is tough to break it out betweenmaintenance and expansion, because when we do any replacements, we tend to getefficiencies also.
John Coyne: I think to elaborate on Tim’s point, as we told you I thinkin the last call some $200 million of that overall spending relates to ourconversion of ‘our wafer fab from 6 inch to 8 inch;that the investment in the initial pilot facility to demonstrate that processtechnology development. Likewise, a significant portion of the $100 millionthat we have indicated relative to the media operations is significantequipment technology upgrades that relates to the 100% transition to PMR overthe course of the coming year. So I think a substantial amount relates totechnology.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Kugele – Needham.
Rich Kugele – Needham:  In terms of the mobile, a significant increase in yourproduction there. Has there also been an improvement because of the volume onthe margins for that product line for you?
John Coyne:   Our mobile product, a combination of volumes, our technologyleadership in that space have all generated a very good mix and a continuingimprovement in margins in that space.
Rich Kugele – Needham:  Are we now north of desktop again versus being below?
John Coyne: Let me just say that we are continuing to improve.
Rich Kugele – Needham:  Obviously even with Komag, your inventory balances were impressive,but can you give us a sense on some of the other line items on the balancesheet ex Komag?
Timothy Leyden: We didn’t have any real changes in the balance sheet otherthan the addition of the Komag items. On the inventories in particular and inthe conversion cycle, we were at ten days positive on the conversion cycle. Whenwe look at that, there was actually a bit of mismatch there, because we had tocount the entire quarter of receivables and also inventory against a very smallamount of gross margin, cost of sales, and revenue.  So consequently that was about three days in that ten whichwill be eliminated when we get down to be able to compare that against theentire quarter. That will bring us down to around seven and we expect that wewill go to about five or six in the current quarter.
Rich Kugele – Needham:  On your external substrate side, obviously there is a lot oftightness there in the market. Can you talk about what you’re seeing for thatpiece of the business since you’re the only company that has 100% their needs?
John Coyne: I think on a worldwide basis, I think the supply of bothaluminum and glass substrates is reasonably well matched to demand. As we’vementioned, we’re continuing to fulfill our external obligations in both media andsubstrate relative to VPAs that are currently in place.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark Miller - Brean MurrayCarret. 
Mark Miller - Brean Murray Carret: Could you give us in terms of weeks of inventory where doyou think the industry is at and where you guys are at?
John Coyne: Ending the quarter, Mark, we were in our normal four to sixweeks range in distribution. I think inventories are very well situated, as Imentioned, ending October 11% down on the same period last year. I don’t havethat translated into weeks but it is a relatively low number, well towards thelow end of the range.
Mark Miller - Brean Murray Carret:  The second question would be, there’s been talk about componentshortages, including disk drives, facing some of the mobile PC builds. I’m justwhat effect, if any, that’s had on you in the December quarter and possibly if you’refeeling any effect for the March quarter?
John Coyne: I think it’s exhibiting slightly differently, customer tocustomer. I think most of the issues are being resolved, but not to the extentwhere there is plenty of availability in the system. I think it’s tight and alittle spotty from customer to customer. I think tightness for the wholequarter with timing being an issue from individual customer to individualcustomer.
Mark Miller - Brean Murray Carret:  Seagate indicated at their analyst meeting that they thoughtHitachi and possible Samsung had --well I’m not going to use their words -- but are behaving themselves. Is it basicallybecause we are just short now in terms of supply, or do you thing there is areal change in management from what we’re hearing, Hitachi, a real pressure tomake some money there?
John Coyne: I think if you look at the sustainedbehavior at Samsung over the course of the last year, we have seen a verysignificant shift in emphasis which we believe is driven by a desire forprofitability and a recognition of Samsung’s structural advantages anddisadvantages.  So it appears to me that they are playing to the strength oftheir supply base and becoming, or at least attempting to become, an outlet forthe technology that they are head and media suppliers can deliver to them andthey are focusing on more niche applications within the overall marketplace.  I think that is very sensible and I think it is very positivefor industry. When I look at Hitachi,we saw their results announced yesterday and I think that is also encouragingin that the management there seems to be focusing on addressing some of thecost issues and focusing on profitability and this is also very good to theindustry.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steve Fox – Merrill Lynch.
Steve Fox – MerrillLynch:  Just to be clear on the dilution impact from Komag in thatquarter just completed, it looks like volumes allowed it to be less diluted. Secondlyon that, can you just talk about how much, given the strong volume demand, whatkind of dilution are we now looking for, for Komag, in the current quarter?
John Coyne:  Well, as you have seen at the addendum to our pressannouncement, we’ve broken out what the media dilution was for the three weeksof September that we owned the business and we have indicated that we would beaccretive in the June quarter. So it will be more or less a straight linebetween those particular points. We’ve also indicated how much we are spendingin OpEx and the other component is the interest rates on the loan that we drewdown.
Steve Fox – MerrillLynch:  So off of this higher base, we can assume less dilution thanyou were probably seeing a month ago, it sounds like.  
John Coyne: Secondly, from here through the end of March as we fulfill ourexternal VPA media obligation and substrate obligations, we then have toconvert that equipment to WD and there are some inefficiencies related to thatin terms of the total utilization of the asset base and the people and somestartup costs related to that so I wouldn’t get too ahead of ourselves there.
Steve Fox – MerrillLynch:  When you talk to your PC customers, given the outlook youare talking about and it doesn’t sound like you are that concerned about doubleordering, are they taking a more conservative bent in terms of what they expectfrom sales over the next few months given what’s going on in the economy? Oryou are not seeing that from your customer?
John Coyne:  I think we are seeing good demand and I think we probablyget a lot more information and a lot more focus on the shape of the USeconomy and the issues in the USeconomy.  One of the things that we noticed in terms of a strength,which was across all geographies but particularly strong in Q1 in Europe.If you look at the movement in relative exchange rate to the US dollar relativeto the European economies, and then you factor in the fact that all IT-relatedproducts -- hard drives, PCs, all IT-related products -- are costed and soldessentially in US dollars.  European customers, European consumers have 30% more buyingpower than they had at this time last year relative to any discretionaryspending on IT. That, I believe, is one of the key drivers of the strength ofEuropean demand for PCs and for storage appliances and DVR type products.  I think to a degree that’s also true in Asia,although the Asia Pacific region growth is probably more driven just by totaleconomic growth in those areas, but again, currencies have strengthenedrelative to US dollar cost.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:  Maybe we can build off of that last question, obviously youwere talking about the currency benefits, I just wanted to get a sense in termsof the underlying trends. What in Europe or Asiais really helping hard disk drives? Is it more the PVR/DVR, the external backuppiece?
John Coyne:  I think we’ve seen strong growth across our entire productline. I think there are two elements of play here relative to WD specifically,as distinct from the strength in the industry generically. Our ability to grow revenues37% year over year relative to industry growth in the high-teens isattributable to WD’s focus on product quality, reliability, availability andflexibility. What you see is customers responding to those values andpreferring WD and that’s a worldwide phenomenon and a multi-channel phenomenon.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:  Do you feel you are outgrowing your peers in both Europeand Asia from a hard disk drive perspective?
John Coyne:  I think we are outgrowing our peers everywhere.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:  Can you maybe talk about the overall blend of the ASPimprovement, how much of it was really driven by mix or just better improvementon market share opportunities for WD?
Timothy Leyden:  I think we had a number of factors, I think we had a bettersegment mix. We had high capacity mix and we had strength in the enterprise andbranded products, which contributes to the higher segment mix.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:  I want to go back to the commentary on the industrydiscipline as far as inventories. It doesn’t really appear that channelinventories or OEM inventories with respect to hard disk drives has really beenan issue since Maxtor faded away, and clearly WD has had a sterling execution recordin terms of what you guys have done with your business model and yourinventories over the past few years.  Are you trying to send a cannonball off the bow to the restof the industry in terms of say, hey, we have a buffer here, don’t mess it upas you go into the first part of next year?
John Coyne:  I don’t think there’s any buffers. I think the point I’mtrying to make is that the industry as a whole is leaner going into January andconsequently I don’t expect the same overhang of inventory to affect thedynamics of supply and demand as severely as they have in prior years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman – Bank ofMontreal. 
Keith Bachman – Bankof Montreal:  The area of out performance was certainly in the mobileside, as I think Rich was alluding to. Could you talk a little bit more, youmentioned some spot shortages. Why was there so much share gain on the mobileside? Related, where at the spot shortages that you are seeing either at OEM orchannel? Where is the most tightness today?
John Coyne: I think where we are seeing tightness is essentially in midcap range of both mobile and desktop. Ithink our strength in mobile has been the fact that we are leading the marketin terms of volume in the 250GB capacity, where I believe in the last quarterwe shipped more 250GB into the market than any other supplier and I think morethan all other suppliers combined. This week, we announced our 320GB, again, wewill lead on time to volume at that capacity. If you look at the mobilemarketplace, there is a very high demand for high-capacity drives in the mobilespace, 320GB being the largest drive available. Having that capacity in ourportfolio makes us a preferred solution for the customer base.
Keith Bachman – Bankof Montreal:  Wouldyou expect in the December quarter in terms of your year-over-year growthrates, would be expect that to likewise be certainly the area of outperformance for December and perhaps even March?
John Coyne: We seestrength in the mobile demand. We see mobile growth rates on an industrybasis continuing to outpace other segments. So it’s reasonable to assume that mobilewould be a significant contributor to our guidance of 12 to 15 points ofyear-over-year growth.
Keith Bachman – Bankof Montreal:  What was the like-for-like ASP changes either sequentiallyyear-over-year?
Timothy Leyden: We covered that. I believe it was --.
Keith Bachman – Bankof Montreal:  I know what the absolute was, just what was thelike-for-like?
Timothy Leyden: We don’t normally on that.
John Coyne:  We don’t give out that information.
Keith Bachman – Bankof Montreal:  Then the final one from me is, you mentioned that you boughtback some stock this quarter; that surprised me a little bit. Was that pre theKomag deal or taking down the term debt? I’m assuming that the buyback is with the debton your balance sheet that you won’t go after that, but if you could justprovide some color on how you intend to treat the buyback going forward?
Timothy Leyden: Yes, it was pre us drawing down the loan, and in the future,though, we will be opportunistic. We keep our options open on that frontbecause if there are favorable conditions, we may continue to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christian Schwab – CraigHallum.
Christian Schwab –Craig Hallum:  The OEM growth of 34% excluding Komag, tremendous growththere. Is that due more to market share gains or due to the fact that you arecapacity constrained, and you ship to them before you ship to the distributionchannel?
John Coyne:  Well, our hard drive growth was 37% year-over-year inrevenues and 29% in unit volume, that was across all segments. It wasn’t an OEMstatement.
Christian Schwab –Craig Hallum:  Right, I am just looking at your OEM revenue quarter over quarter,sequentially which grew 40%, $900 million minus the $40 million that you threw intoKomag which would make it roughly 34%. The question is do you think you aregaining share at the OEM level? 
John Coyne:  Yes and the reason, the primary contributor there is if youlook at the desktop it is a roughly 50% OEM, 50% distribution business. Howeverif you look at mobile it is 80% to 90% OEM business. Therefore growth in mobile,a lot of it falls into the OEM bucket.
Christian Schwab –Craig Hallum:  Perfect. That is the same math I had, just confirming. On thegross margin side the 300 basis point of improvement, what would be a long-termgoal on gross margins should industry conditions remains like are today, stableand well-behaved?
Timothy Leyden:  Well, our current long-term range for gross margins is 15%to 20% and that reflects the mix, the maturity of the products and theseasonality. We are early in the media integration timing and that is adefinite cost opportunity for 300 basis points depending on rational competitorbehavior and pricing. We will reach that point at the end of calendar 2008. Soat that stage, we should be able to reflect that change in the margin but it isto earlier at this particular point.
Christian Schwab –Craig Hallum:  So in essence, longer term should things remain rational, wecan have 20% plus gross margins, correct?
Timothy Leyden:  Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harry Blount – LehmanBrothers.
Harry Blount – LehmanBrothers:  I wanted to come back to a couple of questions on thecontribution on both the ASP increase sequentially as well as gross marginssequentially. If you can maybe help us out in thinking about how much of that didcome from mix, how much of that was pricing? How much was other factors such asthe economy on the Komag side?
Timothy Leyden:  I would say that on a ranking you find the mix contributedthe most, cost contributed and pricing contributed.
Harry Blount – LehmanBrothers:  If we take a look at the December quarter and your abilityto blend up, are you constrained on any of the components that will prevent youfrom being able to blend up a similar amount in the December quarter?
John Coyne:  We believe we will be able to continue to execute ourmanagement style to optimize our business around any demand profile by havingthe most responsive, most flexible manufacturing and supply chain system in theindustry. So I think we will continue to attempt to best optimize the businessrelative to the sales opportunities that present themselves.
Harry Blount – LehmanBrothers:  So definitely, you don’t feel like if you had a chance or youneed to blend up your capacity, your platters per drive, you don’t see eitherplatters, heads or suspension being limiting factors at this point?
John Coyne:  No.
Harry Blount – LehmanBrothers:  You do disclose the Komag results separately, could you giveus a sense of what the intra-company eliminations are either on the revenueand/or gross profit line?
Timothy Leyden:  We haven’t got that information.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi – Caris.
Shebly Seyrafi –Caris:  I just want to make sure I heard you right, did you say thatnet interest income or expense will be $11 million in the December quarter?
Timothy Leyden:  Expense.
Shebly Seyrafi –Caris:  In terms of the ASP change you expect in the Decemberquarter, do you expect it to be flat sequentially or down a few ticks?
Timothy Leyden:  It will be flat sequentially.
Shebly Seyrafi –Caris:  You’re projecting media revenue at $100 million in December.Do you have an idea how that should proceed after the December quarter? Whendoes it go to effectively zero?
Timothy Leyden:  We will be without completed or external obligations by theend of March, but we will continue to have some immaterial amounts ofsubstrates going forward after that.
Shebly Seyrafi –Caris:  Substrates for modeling purposes in June just maybe 5 millionto 10 million or something like that?
Timothy Leyden:  Something in that region. Yes.
Shebly Seyrafi –Caris:  I was surprised you included the in-process R&D chargein your non-GAAP consolidated EPS. I would normally eliminate that and get likea $0.79 number versus your $0.58 number. Tell me why you included that?
Timothy Leyden:  Well, we actually just called that out separately to show itas a one-time charge. On an apples-to-apples basis going forward, you areright. The media operations will continue, so it would be the non-GAAP WD HDDplus the media, which would amount to about 178.
John Coyne:  We did this because in our guidance, in the refresh callthat we did at the beginning of September when we closed the Komag deal, we hadnot envisaged the IP licensing transaction which is why did the separate columnwith the $60 million. So that you could tie it back to the guidance we hadgiven you for the combined WD Komag activity.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers – Wachovia.
Aaron Rakers -Wachovia:  Building on Shebly’s question here, if you look at yourgross margin guidance for the December quarter and you look at that on astandalone basis, can you help us understand what gross margin excluding theKomag impact would be at the high-end of your long-term guidance range of 15%to 20%?
Timothy Leyden:  Well, as we indicated, we’re going to give the amounts on a consolidatedbasis going forward, so the margin indication that we’ve given includes theimpact of the media operation in that number.
Aaron Rakers -Wachovia:  Is it fair to assume that obviously given the accretiveimpact that still is going to be a negative impact on the gross margin line, isthat fair?
Timothy Leyden:  Well, I think if you look at the current situation and lookat what we provided as the addendum for those three weeks, it would be fair toassume if you look at that just maybe quarterize that as John indicated. We’regoing through the transition whereby we are providing product externally, andthen we’ll be tapering down in the January quarter and completely out at theend of March other than for the substrate.
Aaron Rakers -Wachovia:  I’m interested in the comments looking out now into Marchquarter, and one of the areas of notable strength was on the OEM side ofbusiness. Have you seen a change with regard to OEM order patterns in thenotebook market in particular, given the recent, I think one of your peers explicitlystated that they were not able to meet all of their demand. Have you seen alengthening in terms of the OEM forecast that you guys are receiving and that’swhat is giving you better visibility?
John Coyne:  I’ve been addressing this I think in the last few calls. Asthe industry has consolidated and as only a few people have been generating thenecessary revenues -- well, not revenues, generating the necessaryprofitability -- to be able to reinvest in significant technology and productbreadth and in capacity, I think customers are beginning to understand whatthat means strategically and are beginning to view hard drive availability as asignificant enabler of their businesses, and are taking appropriate actions toensure that they have that availability.  So, yes, we’re seeing a much more realistic view emergingthan perhaps in years gone by when it was an assumption that there was going tobe access available at any time.
Aaron Rakers -Wachovia:  Cash flow generation had a pretty solid quarter, but once webake in a full quarter of Komag, maybe you could help us understand how weshould think about quarterly cash flow generation?  Last question for me would be, a couple of quarters ago youhad talked about moving into adjacent market opportunities, any update withregard to that in terms of new product segments that you might go after? Thankyou.
Timothy Leyden:  On the cash flow, we anticipate that the free cash flow forthe current quarter will be around $100 million.
John Coyne:  On growth and adjacent markets, we continue to invest inbreadth of product and we continue to a value opportunity in segments in whichwe don’t participate whether they be hard drives or other solutions to storagedemand, and as we evaluate those markets and our potential to make a significantreturn and leverage our core engineering capability, then those things that passthe standards we will act on them, but as you know we only announce productsand product families when we’re shipping.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeff Brickman – UBS.
Jeff Brickman – UBS:  DVR growth was very solid in the quarter. Is this a functionof the customer preferring [inaudible] hit in the quarter and should we expectthe line to continue to be lumpy going forward?
John Coyne:  Yes I think so. The DVR business is very much a projectdriven business, the demand is very concentrated in large customers such as thecable companies and the direct satellite TV companies. So it tends to be lumpybut some very positive traction, some very good plans in the offering relativeto the transition to HD, all of which is good for storage. On the mid tolong-term basis, I see this as a very solid application for our technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joel Inman – Robert W. Baird.
Joel Inman – RobertW. Baird:  You have had a lot of success in retail driving that as ahigh percentage of your business. Can you give us a sense of where you thinkthat could go in terms of mix and the dynamics between share gain and marketgrowth?
John Coyne:  I think the branded segment continues to be a significantgrowth opportunity for the industry; we’re seeing that the driver of thatgrowth is all of the non-computing content that people now are generating,whether it is with digital cameras or a collection of audio or video content. Thisis a whole new market application. Ithink consumers are becoming educated about the value and the need for backupstorage, they are also becoming very mobile in terms of seeking the means tocarry their data memories and photos with them wherever they go; all of thesethings are very positive for that space. So I think we’ll continue to growthere. Our timing, our product design, our product feature set, ourreputation for quality and reliability, our relationships with the channel inboth retail and direct marketing seem all very positive and all of that acrossthe board has contributed to our success with the My Book and Passport brands.We would certainly hope to continue that and we have a very high focus onensuring that we do.
Joel Inman – RobertW. Baird:  But do you see it being 40% of your mix at some point?
John Coyne:  I think we’ve made the major strides, I think theopportunity for us is to, in the developed markets, to grow with the marketdemand and in some emerging markets which really don’t buy these kinds ofproducts today, the emerging market tends to be very much a do-it-yourselfmarket in the very early days. As average incomes rise then people begin to buythe complete branded finished solution. So emerging markets offer a significantopportunity in the years to come.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Neff – Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff – BearStearns:  I just want to go back to something, as you let the customersknow that you’re in allocation, how do you avoid or measure or factor in doubleordering? There has to be that going on, because they all know the shortagesand they need get what they want.  Can you talk about any pricing trend changes in the notebookarea?
John Coyne:  Let me address the orders first. We have a very high degreeof visibility on inventory levels throughout the channel. Therefore, we canjudge and base allocation on replenishment of inventory levels to what webelieve is appropriate.  In the OEM space, if you look at the large OEM companies,they run very similar models to ourselves; very tight asset turn models. Therefore,we see what’s in the hubs, we see what’s being pulled. We see reporting of whattheir shipments are. I’m not concerned on lack of visibility of true demand.  On pricing in mobile, I mean it continues to be competitive.
Andrew Neff – BearStearns:  Are you in allocation mostly in mobile as well, or is itmostly in the other areas?
John Coyne:  As I mentioned, mid-cap in both 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch, we’re seeing tightness inthe market.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne.
John Coyne:  Well thank you everyone for participating in today’s call. Ilook forward to updating you on our progress in the months and years ahead.Thank you.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to today’s Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Barker Padon. Please go ahead. 
Lori Barker Padon: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the financial teleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the second quarter of 2007. I’m Lori Barker Padon, SanDisk's senior director of investor relations. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.  The agenda for today’s teleconference is as follows: Eli will start with an update on the industry and SanDisk’s overall strategy. Sanjay will follow with operational and business updates, and Judy will end with our second quarter financial results and future guidance. We will conclude the teleconference with your questions for Eli, Sanjay, and Judy.  Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available, along with supplemental schedules on our website at SanDisk.com.  After the completion of this call, an audio replay of this conference, a copy of today’s prepared comments and quarterly metrics will be made available on SanDisk's investor relations website at SanDisk.com.  During our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances is a forward-looking statement, including those related to revenue, pricing, sales, expenses, gross margin, megabyte growth, supply, demand, inventory, production capacity, emerging markets, investments and future products and applications.  Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Certain factors that may cause actual results to differ are detailed under the caption Risk Factors and in elsewhere in documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and our Form 10-Q for Q1 2007. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof.  We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference.  Now, I would like to turn our call over to our CEO, Eli Harari. 
Eli Harari: Thank you, Lori. This quarter was the first quarter of operations under our new organization structure that integrates the legacy businesses of SanDisk and M-Systems. Managing this more global and diverse organization of business Sanjay, our cofounder, President, and COO is leading day-to-day management of the company and that allows me to focus on strategic issues facing the company and the industry.  Therefore Sanjay will be covering the operational and business update in our quarterly call. While I will address the overall strategy in our big picture outlook.  Please do not view this as a signal that I plan to retire any time soon. To the contrary these are exciting times for SanDisk and I'm energized by the many strategic opportunities and challenges ahead of us.  The second quarter started under very difficult market conditions but improved markedly as the quarter progressed. April and May were characterized by excess supply, but July is coming to balance and during the distinct possibility the demand for high capacity flash products may outstrip industry wide supply in the second half of this year. Investor plays out then the second quarter will turn out to have been the bottom of the current severe down cycle which in turn would signal the beginning of the next industry upturn. If that is the case then all our strategic investments in low cost captive capacity Fab 3 and Fab 4 will prove to be exceptionally well timed.  I believe there are two key factors that are driving the fortunes of the flash industry. First is the storage space of product innovations where flash is an enabler for mobile products. For example, the iPhone is the industry’s first product where only two models available are cutting rise by either the 4 gigabyte or an 8 gigabyte iPhone for flash storage, this is remarkable. The iPhone switch innovative feature has the potential to be an industry transforming product in the fastest growing and most competitive mobile market for multimedia handsets.  iPhone validates everything we have been saying about flash storage in multimedia handsets and it may have far greater impact on the flash market in 2008 than the launch of the iPod Nano had in 2005. Apple’s own conception of non-flash may become substantial in 2008, but also major competitors are accelerating deployment of high capacity flash in new multimedia handsets to mark a ferocious challenge to the iPhone.  We believe that in the next 12 to 18 months we will see the mobile storage requirement in multimedia phones bifurcate into an OEM business if it is driven by high capacity embedded storage such as iNAND in multichip packages or even MegaSIM on the one hand and high capacity cards sold primarily through retail on the other hand with a gradual decline in the OEM bundled low capacity costs. SanDisk is uniquely positioned to gain from this expected shift, as we have built strong sales organizations that we are separately focused on mobile OEM and mobile retail worldwide.  The second key factor is rapidly growing global markets in the new consumer economy which is fuelling or surging demand in consumer electronics and mobile markets. The years’ economy used to be the engine of growth for the rest of the world. Today, the world economies are charging ahead across many geographies, with Europe and Pac Rim countries expected to fuel global growth of consumer demand for a foreseeable future.  SanDisk will be a benefactor for these global economic trends because we are becoming a trusted global consumer brand, and because we continue to invest aggressively in global distribution of our product and in the global logistic supply chain. In the second quarter we saw a year-to-year doubling in units sold in Europe and we are expanding our field activities to tap the huge potential for us in international markets in the coming year.  NAND flash has become one of the most strategic enabling technologies for portable consumer electronics and mobile products. NAND MLC in particular has got affordable storage to the sweet spot of this market. According to Gardner, a market research firm, in 2001 NAND flash was two times more expensive to megabyte than DRAM. In 2007, DRAM is four times more expensive to megabyte than NAND MLC.  This is the result of DRAM pricing declining by 5.5 times between 2001 and 2007. While NAND MLC declined by 45. I say that again 45 times, not percent, times. While non-scaling will become more difficult with smaller geometries in the coming years, NAND may indeed pull an increasingly more disruptive threat to hard disk drives used in mobile applications.  On the IP front, the ITC case against STMicroelectronics went against us and given ST's announcement about spinning off their NOR and NAND, we decided not to appeal. Both we and STMicro agreed to dismiss our patent infringement cases in Texas, but still have the California cases pending.  We also signed a card license with Taiwan based Ritek and we plan to aggressively pursue licensing other card manufacturers.  In addition, our SD card licensing program shows continuing growth with the increasing popularity of microSDs.  Concerning what the demand/supply situation is in the second half of the year, prices are firming up and there are market signs that the pendulum may have begun to swing back in our direction. The market has now had two full quarters to absorb the industry-wide transition to MLC late last year, which caused abrupt inventory bubble that had to work its way through the channel. This was a one type of crunch that should not repeat itself at the end of this year.  With price elasticity in new products driving megabytes to new demand worldwide, we believe the industry would likely be tight in supply of high density MLC components, as we move into the seasonally strong back half of the year. We are fortunate that we control our destiny through our captive supplying of low cost NAND, MLC at Fab 3 this year and Fab 4 in 2008. I am optimistic that our long term strategy for market leadership should translate into improving financial in the second half of 2007 and in 2008. I will now pass it on to Sanjay. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Eli. SanDisk had a solid second quarter. Even though the overall industry climate remained challenging, we achieved positive results in driving demand and market share for our products. Managing the product supply chain, growing international sales, increasing average product capacities, diversifying product mix, reducing unit costs, and controlling expenses. First, I will highlight the key development in some of our main markets.  The digital imaging market experienced surprisingly strong sequential revenue growth, which was particularly enhanced by growth in our international geographies and by sales of our high performance cards, such as Ultra and Extreme. As of May 2007, total unit shipments of digital cell cameras worldwide grew about 25% year-over-year according to the Camera and Imaging Products Association. The strong DSC market, helped drive more than 2.5-folds year-over-year increase in our best sold through the digital imaging market in the second quarter. You may have seen the announcement yesterday of our worldwide marketing campaign with Ducati. We are making a strong branding push emphasizing speed and performance as we step up customers to higher margin products.  In the mobile market, we saw strong growth in retail revenue, but results were light in the OEM channel due to aggressive pricing and reduced market demand for certain handset models at one of our customers.  Our mDOC revenue was also light in the quarter, with the industry beginning to shift toward more advanced multi-chip packages, MCPs that combined NAND with mobile DRAM. We believe MCPs will represent a growing segment of the embedded mobile storage market, with revenues starting in the first half of 2008.  For iNAND we are also engaged in strong designing activity at tier-one mobile OEM accounts for our second generation at densities of 4GB, 8GB and 16GB. In the retail channel, sales were strong with both units and revenue increasing more than 50% sequentially. Further, average retail mobile card capacity grew about 20% sequentially reflecting continued adoption of high capacity cards for mobile applications. The unit demand for high capacity mobile cards was exceptionally strong and we launched the industry’s first high capacity 4-GBMemory Stick Micro M2 cards and the industry’s first 6-GB and 8-GB microSD cards.  For the computing market, we launched our 64GB solid state drive for notebook PCs to meet the projected growth in demand for high capacity SSDs. Furthermore, we announced that our SATA 5000 2.5-inch SSD will be used by IBM for data storage within the Blade Center HS21 XM. This is the industry’s first Blade server to feature a solid state storage solution and we are proud to be part of that achievement.  While the SSD market is still in its infancy and we don’t expect significant revenues this year, the continued adoption of our SSD products going forward by PC, server and other system solution providers positions us well to be a key player in that market segment. We have made substantial progress toward pursuing our strategy of increasing our market shares outside of our traditionally strong U.S. market.  According to GSK, a market research firm, SanDisk’s overall revenue market shares in Europe across all product categories increased by almost 4 percentage points during May compared to March of 2007. Also unit sales of our products doubled year-over-year in both Europe and Asia. I believe that the new dedicated international sales teams we are putting in place will give us greater ability to drive our business in specific regions, and I am optimistic about continued gains in international sales of our products.  Solid execution remained the hallmark of our manufacturing operations. Fab 3 continued to ramp with 56 nanometer process technology reaching cost parity with the 70 nanometer technology, early in the second quarter. Given the healthy ramp of the 56 nanometer technology and the excellent yields, we have been able to achieve in Fab 3, we are now more confident that we can meet our demand even in the seasonally strong fourth quarter with minimal reliance on non-captive supply. Fab 4 is on schedule with initial production planned for the end of the year and ramping up during 2008.  In summary, the new organizational structure and the market expansion initiative that we discussed at last February’s analysts meeting are already bearing fruit, giving us what we believe to be strong momentum for continued growth.  The innovation engine at SanDisk is strong and we are excited about the work we are doing to bring differentiated products to market. We are seeing good progress on unit cost and our strong execution on the 56 nanometer production should manifest itself favorably in our financial results in the second half of 2007.  Let me now turn the call over to Judy. 
Judy Bruner: Thank you Sanjay and Eli and good afternoon everyone. Our year-over-year increase in product revenue of 13% reflected an increase in megabyte sold of 217%, and a decline in ASP per megabyte sold of 65%, as well as an increase in non-memory product revenue.  On a sequential basis, our megabyte sold were up 50% and our ASP per megabyte was down 26%, adjusting for the fact that we are no longer consolidating the TwinSys joint venture, which added 53 million to Q1 and our total product revenue increased sequentially by 13%. Looking at our revenue by channel, we return to our more traditional mix with retail comprising 67% of our revenue.  Our retail sales exhibited very strong seasonal recovery with retail revenue up 41% sequentially. Megabyte sold of 74% and ASP per megabyte down 18%. The 18% retail decline in ASP per megabyte compares very favorably to 35% in the first quarter, and the 74% retail megabyte growth compares to 45% in Q2 of last year.  We believe the favorable Q2 retail megabyte growth reflects three factors; one, the elasticity benefit of price reductions over the last several quarters, two, the exaggerated seasonal softness in Q1, and three, the growing retail mobile market. We saw very strong sequential retail sales growth in our imaging mobile handset and MP3 products.  On a year-over-year basis, our retail revenue grew 9% reflecting robust growth in megabyte sold of 236%, and a steep 68% decline in ASP per megabyte. We saw the strongest year-over-year retail growth in our mobile business followed by growth in MP3 and USB sales.  Looking at OEM sales on a sequential basis and removing the effect of TwinSys in Q1, OEM revenue was down 22% with megabyte sold approximately flat to last quarter and ASP per megabyte down 27%. As Sanjay discussed, our mobile OEM revenue was down sequentially due to aggressive price declines coupled with the reduction in unit demand from one of our handset OEM customers, and a decline in mobile embedded sales.  On a year-over-year basis, our OEM sales were up 23% with megabyte sold up 166% and ASP per megabyte down 57%. The year-over-year OEM revenue growth primarily reflects the addition of product lines from the M-Systems acquisition such as mobile embedded and industrial embedded products, and non memory products such as SIM cards sold in the mobile network operator channel.  While OEM sales were weak this quarter, retail sales were particularly strong and our overall product revenue performance demonstrates the benefit we derive from the diversity of our product lines and customers.  License and royalty revenue for the second quarter of $107 million increased 30% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, and reflects the addition of our license agreement with Hynix increased card based royalties and higher than forecasted component based royalties. The component royalty increase is primarily the result of higher royalty rates on one of our licensees Q1 sales resulting from certain sales thresholds. These higher royalty rates will not be repeated in the remaining quarters of the year resulting in annual royalty rates by product lines that are consistent with the past.  Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin of 19%, improved slightly from 18.5% in Q1, primarily because our costs decreased slightly more than our prices on a per megabyte basis. The amount of inventory related charges in Q2, was similar to Q1 as a percentage of sales and did not contribute to the gross margin improvement. The Q2 inventory charges primarily relate to certain products where our sales forecasts are less than originally anticipated.  Our Q2 shipments were made with approximately 95% captive memory consistent with the Q1 captive shipment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $169 million; $8 million less than in Q1 and significantly below the forecast I had provided of $190 million to $200 million. About half of this difference is due to a shift in certain Fab 4 startup costs from Q2 to Q3. This does not reflect any delay in Fab 4, just the timing of when the expenses will be incurred.  The other reasons for lower spending in Q2, included a shift in certain sales and marketing expenses from Q2 to Q3, and better than anticipated savings from our cost containment actions. Other income of $38.5 million included a $4.1 million one-time gain related to the sale of certain equity investments.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments decreased $267 million to $3.2 billion. We utilized $90 million of cash in operations, primarily due to an increase in product and royalty receivables. Days sales outstanding are at a favorable level of 39 days. Inventory, net of reserves, increased slightly to $601 million remaining above 90 days of inventory. We are comfortable that this inventory will service well to meet the expected demand in the second half of the year, when non-captive supply may be more costly. We provided $123 million in cash to flash partners for Fab 3 equipment in the form of a note receivable, and we received $13 million from Flash Vision in final payback of the Flash Vision note receivable.  We also invested $54 million in SanDisk capital equipment, which included assembly and test equipment for our captive factory in China, as well as some captive Fab equipment that we now own at a foundry for our 3G products and processes. The last key use of cash was $55 million for repurchase of our shares.  I will now turn to our outlook.  Traditionally, megabyte growth in Q3 is less than in Q2 due to slower summer seasonality. And we expect a similar pattern this year. Over the last three years, our Q3 megabyte growth has ranged between 20% and 40% sequentially and we believe this is a reasonable range to expect for this Q3. At the same time the pricing environment is expected to be significantly more favorable for us, than in the first half of the year.  We have few planned price reductions in retail for the summer months. However, our ASP per megabyte will still decline due to price reductions implemented in June, which will impact all of Q3. With our OEM customers, some of the expected Q3 business is locked in at prices quoted during Q2, which reflect a sequential quarterly reduction.  Our expectations for megabyte growth and pricing, lead us to forecast Q3 product revenue in the range of $750 million to $825 million.  Looking at the year, we now expect bid growth for 2007 of 180% to 200% up from our previous forecast of 170% plus. We expect Q3 license and royalty revenue between $105 and $115 million based upon the forecast of sales of our license fees.  For 2007, we are raising our forecast of license and royalty revenue from our previous forecast of $400 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million.  Turning to gross margins, we expect cost decline to exceed price decline leading to forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin of 20% to 24% in Q3. And we currently anticipate a continued gradual increase in gross margin for Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of 56 nanometer sales. We expect Q3 GAAP product gross margin to be lower than non-GAAP by approximately 3 percentage points due to the inclusion of stock compensation and acquisition related purchase accounting charges.  We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million, reflecting a sequential increase of approximately $20 to $25 million in Fab 4 R&D start-up costs and increased investment in future technologies as well as in sales and marketing programs related to the demand generation and expanding our international footprint. We currently expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase again in Q4 due to seasonal sales and marketing expenses. Well, Fab 4 start-up costs are forecasted to be at approximately the same level in Q4 as in Q3.  Q3 GAAP operating expenses are expected to be higher than non-GAAP by approximately $34 million to $38 million due to stock compensation and acquisition related intangible assets.  Other income for Q3 is expected to be about 10 million lower than in Q2 due to the one time investment gains in Q2, anticipated lower cash balances as a result of the fab investment and a shift in our investment portfolio towards more tax exempt securities which yield us a better after tax return.  On the balance sheet, we forecast that Q3 inventory levels will likely increase in preparation for Q4, and we expect to make cash investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of approximately $350 million about half of which we had originally expected to fund in Q2.  In summary, we are optimistic that the improved supply-demand balance in the NAND market will continue leading to a return to a more normal price declines and a gradual improvement in our margins in the second half for this year.  We will now open up the call for your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Hey congratulations on a great quarter and great guidance. 
Eli Harari: Thanks Daniel. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: First of all I was wondering if you could give us some color about the Ritek deal and do you think this is going to be a model for additional deals in Asia with regards to many of the ODMs and OEMs or smaller ones out there? 
Eli Harari: Yes, we do. We have put together a -- frankly a new license contracts for a third party card reserves, a card including USB flash drive, MP3 players and so on. And well, I think is the first one that in fact have find out for that license in hand. We expect it to be -- we will certainly offer it to a wide range of other potential licensees and hopefully they will sign up. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Okay, and then just turning to SSD. Obviously with the pricing going up for a component, I guess not for you guys, but for everyone else in the world, I was wondering where do you think we should see the inflection point for SSD coming? Is it going to be function of how NAND compares in price to magnetic? Is there some trigger point that you think we will see a tipping of -- or a ramp of SSD? 
Eli Harari: Well, we set the asset several times that SSD really needs to shift to multilevel sale MLC flash even -- it did basically at any technology node. In order for the SSD to become attractive at 32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte for the consumer space, it certainly needs to go to the 56 nanometer or 50 nanometer or so, a generation of MLC and this is what we are focused on. In the enterprise space, the service space, the pricing is substantially higher, the requirements are different, although the market there is relatively small -- I mean smaller than the notebook market, it's still a very substantial market and as you know that this type of people make all of their margins -- the majority of their margin enhance price space. So, with the announcement about IBM server design win, we're basically signaling that we are going to be addressing both the consumer SSD market and the server market. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations. 
Eli Harari: I would say -- really as Sanjay said, we expect this to be really marketed to be very design win intensive over the next 12 months and really start generating material revenues in 2008. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kapur with Piper Jaffray. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Great, thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could provide your views what kind of -- what types of densities you expect within the mobile handset applications over the next say 12 to 24 months? Most of the phones that we see out there seemed to be capped off with 2 gigabyte memory card support. Do you see any new applications or potential iPhone impact on other OEMs breaking through that barrier soon? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We certainly see the average capacities in mobile handsets continuing to increase. If you look at last year to this year, average capacities for retail have doubled in the mobile handset business. We certainly continue to see the same trend forward. By end of the year in retail we would expect the average capacities to be about 2 gigabyte. On the embedded side as well with our iNAND we are seeing strong design wins and these are iNAND design wins of high capacity 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte. And on the card side for mobile handsets, the support for high capacity cards is certainly coming through and then in near future we will see, we will begin to ship 8 gigabyte cards as well later on in the years. And we will have the handset support for high capacity microSD and other high capacity cards as well. So all in all, we continue to see strong trend both on the embedded as well as usage of cards for high capacity, in the handset market. 
Eli Harari: I would add that in the retail market, on the high capacity, that is 4 and 8 gigabytes, the key issue that is being resolved as we speak has been designing the new handsets to accommodate the high capacity, the SDHC standard and that is helping right now. So moving forward, I think certainly in this quarterly sale season and certainly next year, the aftermarket will move very much to 4 and 8 gigabytes to basically meet the iPhone phone 8 gigabyte capacity points. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great. Maybe one quick follow-up. Mobile TV seems to be gaining support with some of the wireless carriers out there. But the ability to store content seems kind a limited. What are some of the barriers do you see in mobile video storage and when do you expect those to be resolved? 
Eli Harari: The issue there is very much infrastructure to deliver content, both mobile TV as well as movies in reasonable time because of bandwidth allocation. The wireless bandwidth allocations are still very severe. So this is slightly [changing]. But then there is also the protection DRAM schemes for protecting valuable video content, movies and so on. We think that the industry on the TV side is, they need to move very much away from selling you TV episodes for $1.99 or so to add supported three downloads of TV programs. We think that that's a great move for the industry and of course for us, because, this would definitely simplify the whole infrastructure for delivery of this TV program. In terms of downloads, we believe that TV programming will far, far exceed downloading of movies at least for the next 12 months or so. This is a very exciting situation right now, and definitely the entire content providers are looking now very eagerly at how to move in a big way to download content, not just to standalone players, PMP players, video players, and music players, but also to handsets. Handsets is eventually going to be the biggest application for video and in fact iPhone has demonstrated or will be demonstrating, what a great platform, the handset, the multimedia handset could be for video programs. So we are very early, but this is going to be a very-very large market. 
Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray: Great, thanks a lot guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Eli you seem quite positive about the outlook for the beginning of next year. This time around we are not going to get that one-time effects of the MLC RAM, but is there anything in the new products that also gives you confidence that you will see kind of overflow of demand, and I'm thinking here will the SSD, which is presumably not a seasonal sale have any impact in the first half of next year, or for that matter the aftermarket sale of cards in these new multimedia handsets? 
Eli Harari: Yeah I don't think that SSD can absorb, can make a big difference frankly in Q1, Q2 next year in terms of the demand supply balance, but I do think that the two key factors that will influence the demand supply balance in Q1 will be Vista on the one side which is really been directed through the DRAM market. If Vista finally really drives demand for DRAM that will definitely impact the supply of NAND through non-conversion of DRAM capacity to NAND.  And the second one is what we said the market’s reaction to the iPhone that brought in the first quarter next year should start kicking in our first quarter next year, the 3GSM Conference and everybody is seriously working on products that will be very attractive, significantly less expensive than $600 and we’ll definitely use a lot of flash. And this is where we see the biggest possibility for creating a demand supply balance or in fact an imbalance in favor of demand. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: And the second question, Judy the Fab 4 ramp at what point do the start-up cost get rolled into gross margins? And how should we be thinking about the gross margin impact from the event when it happens, timing its etcetera and magnitude? 
Judy Bruner: Sure. We currently expect the impact of the Fab 4 start-up cost to begin rolling into cost of sales in the fourth quarter. We expect they will continue to be start-up costs in R&D in the fourth quarter at approximately a similar level to that of the third quarter, but then additional start-up costs beginning to hit cost of sales in the fourth quarter. So that would have some muting affect on their gross margins in the fourth quarter. But as I said we're optimistic in terms of the pricing environment for the second half and the effect that by the fourth quarter of this year we’ll begin to have much more contribution from 56-nanometer in our sales. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you we're going next to Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Hi, good afternoon. So Eli at this point are you in a position to talk about cell phone revenues for the year now that it seems you have locked in lot of OEM as well as you’ll see some retail sales. What is the prediction by the end of the year, cell phone would be for SanDisk? 
Eli Harari: What do you mean? 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: The cell phone revenue as percentage of your total product sales from cell phones.? 
Eli Harari: We are not providing this kind of prediction. I could tell you that in terms of unit revenues for Q2, we saw approximately 30 million units combined and we certainly expect the unit count and megabytes’ count to increase in the second half of the year.  And as we've indicated this consists of a decline in bundled cost and then increase in retail cost as well as a decline in low capacity units and increase in high capacity units. So it's moving in the right direction flow. But I would expect that this year mobile will be our biggest revenue generated for the year with one for (inaudible) is that as we've said for this second quarter the digital still camera market was significantly strong in retail and if that trend continues and that too will be a very strong market for the rest of the year. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay, Eli, one other question on the licensing side. In terms of STMicro, you've gone with STMicro even though you said you are dropping it right now in terms of appeal, you have lost the case two times and contrast that with Samsung back in 1997. What’s the message I think will be, we are struggling here, why did you loose the STK's at ITC and basically in future, how airtight is your intellectual property? 
Eli Harari: We think we have very, very strong intellectual property. We lost the case, frankly the same partner has contested three times at the ITC with three different judges. The outcome in the three cases was in the first case we won on infringement and validity. In the second case, we won on validity but not on infringement. I guess we lost on validity and non-infringement. In the third, we won on infringement and non-validity. So this is the part of the frustration that you have when you are dealing with a patent case. I would say if there was one error that we made, a strategic error is that we tried to go for a very quick resolution and therefore relied on a single patent which we thought was definitely a very strong, a pretty fundamental patent that we create. And if I had to do it all over again I would definitely bring significantly more patents to play in here.  When you bring the same patent, what happens is that the other side learns all the arguments and all the counter arguments and that was the mistake that we made. We will learn from that mistake. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay, thank you. 
Eli Harari: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Thanks. Just a couple of question from my end. Now Eli, you talked about the potential of demand exceeding supply in second half of this year. Now, it looks like both Samsung and Hynix are having some yield issues with their current process transition, and it will be resolved at some point in time. How does that influence your supply projections and your potential forecast? 
Eli Harari: We are not counting on them to fail. We are counting on them to succeed and they have been very good in the past at delivering whatever the market needs within limits. More importantly is how much big capacity do they allocate between NAND and DRAM in nothing that’s more important than yield issues. I think that they will -- my assumption is that they will all become those yield issues. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Okay, thanks. Secondly, can you update us on when you plan to go into volume production on three bits per cell x4, and also any progress on the Matrix side? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, on the three bits per cell as we said before, we will have initial product shipments of three bit based technology early in 2008. On the four bits per cell technology, we will have samples in second half of 2008, and the three bit technology we are working on -- and the 3D technology, we are working on transitioning that to the next generation technology note and we are continuing to make good progress there. On the OTP side as well as working on developing the read-write version of that technology which Eli had mentioned is the R&D efforts that will take two to three years to really fully materialize. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: So, on the four bits per cell line, you are talking about samples in the second half of the year or for next year? 
Eli Harari: Excuse me. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: So on the XFER you said you are having samples in the second half of next year? 
Eli Harari: Yes. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: So that would be a slight delay from your previous statement? 
Eli Harari: I feel last time that we had decide to apply XFER on a more advanced, the leading edge foundry node rather on an existing or trailing edge node and that basically means that we scrapped products on the 70 nanometers foundry, which we actually have and are focusing on a more advanced, on really the leading edge foundry in that time frame. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with Citi. 
Craig Ellis - Citi: Thanks for taking the question. Just first a question for Eli. Eli, you have talked about the number of supply/demand factors into early next year. How much of your competence in an upturn in NAND is predicated on the challenge that industry will pace as it moves up at 200 millimeter capacity in the first half of next year and the dampening effect that will happen over other group? 
Eli Harari: I think as I have said and I think now lot of people are saying, in fact, I think I believe the Koreans are saying the same thing now, that they plan to not drive advanced technology transitions in NAND under 200 millimeters. So that will have an impact on reduced supply under one hand, on the 200 millimeter. On the other hand, they are investing aggressively in 300 millimeter. So I think that, I am looking more frankly at this point to the surging demand we talked about, this global increase in demand that we -- it's a real phenomenon, and the fact that we have such a relatively small market share in many of these geographic markets is their stuffed optimism, that once they are put in place, the kind of resources that we have, we build in the United States that we can do significantly better and that will drive at least for us, we believe continued growth and demand and account for a 100% of assets from our captive supply. 
Craig Ellis - Citi: Okay. Thanks for that Eli. And then Judy, just a couple of quick ones. First on royalties. For a couple of quarters we are in the low teens as a percent of revenue. The long-term model is really high single digits at 10%. Is there anything unusual other than the one-time item you mentioned in the second quarter royalty that's going to impact how we think about the longer term model? 
Judy Bruner: I'd always say really the only other factor is that we are seeing success in terms of growing our card based royalties. But at this point, I would not change our long-term model. 
Craig Ellis - Citi: Okay. And then secondly, I wasn't there on the gross margin commentary in the outlook. It sounded like there was a similar degree of inventory write-down pressure in the second quarter, as you saw in the first quarter. What is assumed in the third quarter guidance with regards to inventory write-down? 
Judy Bruner: Well of course it's difficult to predict what inventory write-downs might be in any future quarter. But, we are optimistic that inventory write-downs in the second half will not be at the level they were in the first half. And that could be a factor and in gross margin improvement. But the primary factor that we are looking at is the pricing environment, and then as we get further into the second half, the higher contribution of 565 nanometer product. 
Craig Ellis - Citi: Okay. Thanks to everybody and congratulations on the quarter. 
Eli Harari: Thank you. 
Operator: Next we'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Hi guys, good afternoon thanks so much for taking my question. Couple of quick things some of what you alluded a little bit too on the remarks up until now. But I guess first you have the advantage now where you have the capital supply as your competitors your card competitors costs are going higher, how do you strategically think about the decision of increasing market share versus increasing margin? 
Eli Harari: I think we should try to maximize our margin of course but keep our output at a 100% utilization. And at this stage it's a little bit academic, it's very difficult to frankly – the list is like this, non-captive supply today is very, very expensive and were definitely at this stage a bit difficult to justify to bring additional captive capacity overall to gain market share at the crest or close to zero or may be even negative margin, it's not what we would want to do this time. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: And I mean I guess another way to ask it would be with your captive supply that you have, how do you just make the decision between being price aggressive to try to go out to gain share with your captive supply versus just trying to have higher margins because, your supply is cheaper than your competitor's supply? 
Eli Harari: Well, first and foremost, we make sure that we address our strategic customers and don't behave opportunistically. On the other hand we as well as the industry, the supply side have really suffered through this price decline and we do think I have said many times that the kind of profit we've seen in the last two years are really unsustainable and that to justify future investments you really needed to get to significantly better gross margins than what we have experienced in the last two quarters. So you can improve your gross margins primarily by holding costs, by bringing cost down faster than your pricing comes down. And in some cases you want to bring your prices up because they were forced upon you to be way too low because of crazy competitive situation. We will definitely try to regain some pricing whatever we can, but not opportunistically not point of abandoning or offsetting low trend on strategic customers. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay that’s helpful and that kind of leads into my second question which is, we are now in a very good position in the industry but in large part because supply got cut so much, our new supply growth got cut so much because of the move to from NAND to DRAM and because of the decrease in NAND orders from some of your competitors to the equipment suppliers. How do we get comfortable with now that pricing is looking better, that everything is not just going to come flying back on line, that your competitors aren’t going to just turn on this, pick it again and that you guys along with Toshiba aren’t just going to increase the CapEx again because that could be what brings all this to a faster halt than we would have hope for? How are you thinking about it and how can you help us to get comfortable with the continued discipline on the supply side? 
Eli Harari: It’s a good point, good question and definitely it seems to go south in the future and there will definitely be periods where we have these kind of situations, where industry as you know go through these cycles. But what's working for us is price elasticity, and demand elasticity is very strong right now. It finally caught up with the pricing and its much -- I mean we are talking about 220% increase in megabyte trickling our megabyte shipments year after year, so we have the large number of -- the theory of large number is actually now in our favor and that it's becoming more and more difficult to double the megabytes output because the basic numbers are now becoming very large. It's very difficult for new players to come in and make a dent. So, I think that the industry -- and everybody had suffered frankly through this experience of the last two quarters, but frankly we've had six quarters lost pretty severe quarter-to-quarter ASP declines, and I would say the sixth quarter is the longest down cycle the demand industry has had. And I think that the industry -- all the supplies would like to see this trend kind of turn around and much more moderate first declines, but of course the key to that is to get the demand [throughout our 50], through new products, through existing markets and new markets investment we are working on. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful, thanks. And then my final question and then I’ll go away. In terms about the royalty stream, you've referenced earlier like at the analyst meeting that Samsung, you would continue to negotiate with them as they contract, that’s called the current contract, it gets closer to expiring at the end of 2009 and you had said that that would be a difficult negotiation but you thought it would ultimately be successful. And then -- so, any update there, and then on Micron, Micron seems pretty automate that they're never going to have to pay you guys a license -- a royalty fee and I'm curious as to your opinion about that? Thank you. 
Eli Harari: Yes, I repeat what I said, I have no need to repeat this basically what I said about Samsung. We still believe that that would have been the best expense of Samsung and send it to a -- come to an agreement before the expiration of the current agreement. With regards to Micron, nothing has changed as far as our thinking which is of course not the same as their thinking and we will continue to work on that one. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much. Congratulations. 
Eli Harari: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Thanks a lot. A couple of questions here. First, what's the percent of production where you have a 56 nanometer by year end? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we have said before, by end of the year we will have majority of our bit production in terms of output from the fabs in 56 nanometer. And that the 56 nanometer ramp is going extremely well, we feel pretty confident in our ability to meet that previous guidance. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Okay. And then the question -- a bit about your OEM mobile business as it relates I guess to the mDOC's/the iNAND. Can you a bit think about how does this compare with your previous expectations, I guess before the M-Systems acquisition? And is there a following against the iPhone trend here? I mean is there a change I guess in the mindset which direction it's going here in terms of embedded NAND in handsets. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, embedded NAND on the handset as we said in the prepared statement, really the trend is in two directions. One primary trend is toward multi-chip packages and with our partnership with Qimonda, in the joint venture with Qimonda, we plan to have multi-chip packaged solutions in the first half of next year. Also on the embedded side, we are seeing the trend is moving toward the iNAND type of solution. A high capacity iNAND design wins, and with that we will see increase in our revenues later on in the year because iNAND embedded solutions design wins in terms of production take somewhat longer. By end of the year we will be seeing increases in embedded revenue coming in from the iNAND. So, the mDOC part is really shifting towards multi-chip packages, as well as, toward iNAND design wins. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: And where does the MegaSIM kind of fit into the strategy here? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: The MegaSIM also is an attractive semi-removable solution and that is also something that we are offering to the customers and we are seeing increasing design wins in that area as well. 
Eli Harari: On the MegaSIM, of course, the target customers for MegaSIM are not the handset manufacturers, but the mobile network operators, because they sell the SIM today. They own that and in their endeavor to increase their ARPUs, they are moving to more services than they could handle. The services could be much richer, if they were able to store a lot of content on the MegaSIM. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Eli Harari: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Alex Guana with UBS. 
Steven Chin - UBS: Thanks. This is Steven Chin calling behalf of Alex. I just had a couple of more questions related to the iNAND and mDOC product lines. So as far as relative positioning going forward, it sounds like iNAND and other MCP type products will have more preference or usage in embedded cell phone application. Just given that, does that mean mDOC sales would begin to decline at a certain point and then you would have a crossover between iNAND sales and mDOC sales? And secondly, for iNAND MCP type products, would you guys typically be a single source for those sockets, or would it be dual source or and more because of the standardized footprints for some of these products? 
Eli Harari: So, really you have the point on the second point which is the standardization. So, what that means, in the mobile space for embedded is that there is rule among the main suppliers towards [JDC 64] which in itself is not just one product, but assembly of products that migrates towards eventually a bootable NAND working with a mobile DRAM and that is a direction that we are moving with iNAND and Samsung is moving with moviNAND, Toshiba has the GB NAND and its trying to satisfy the handset manufacturers that perhaps are tired of dealing with very large number of proprietary solutions that are not really the way to go for very high volumes. 
Lori Barker Padon: There is time for one more caller please. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our last question from Bennett Notman with Davenport. 
Bennett Notman - Davenport: Thank you for getting me in at the buzzer here. It seems like since you've locked up the bulk of the NAND manufacturing marketplace in terms of the licensing opportunity, you are now diversifying and going into sort of ancillary and related opportunities. And could you just talk a little bit about the potential for licensing outside of the manufacturers and into the other NAND market areas and how you look at that opportunity versus the magnitude of the opportunity you've got with the manufacturers? 
Eli Harari: We've said that we think we have most of the NAND manufacturers and NAND, NOC manufacturers covered and we of course have by virtue of SD, many of the microSD being a very large part of the card business. We have that covered through the SD association. We don't have the other card manufacturers and USB flash drive covered in this. This is a target area that we are pursuing through this licensing program. It will be significantly smaller, than the component business, but let's say in the next one to two years; however we've said that eventually we think that most flash memory will be sold as a card or as a system solution as opposed to a component and at that point, we'd like to capture both aspects of the product. 
Bennett Notman - Davenport: And do you have incremental opportunities in controller -- in the area of controllers or just other portions of in the enabling technology within the system or would it be just be sort of one license for the end card make? 
Eli Harari: You would rather license the card makers than the controller makers. The controller maker's patent law, it says that we cannot license to controller and also separately double it if you will. If you license the controller manufacturer, and license to flash manufacturer, you basically have licensed -- you've licensed the card. We'd rather go after the card and separately from the memory, and not license the controller manufacturer. 
Bennett Notman - Davenport: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you again. And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the program back over to today’s presenters for any additional or closing comments. 
Eli Harari: Okay. So, I would like to thank everyone here for listening today and we are looking forward to seeing a number of you during our upcoming conferences. Thank you very much. Goodbye. 
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your line at any time.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Good afternoon everyone. As most of you may know, I am co-hosting the call today, as Eli is away on a well deserved vacation. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for SanDisk. Total revenue of $1.2 billion marked the first ever billion dollar quarter for SanDisk, thanks to strong demand globally for our products, market share gains and our solid execution across all fronts. In addition, our fourth quarter non-GAAP standalone gross margin increased sequentially despite an aggressive pricing environment.  Total revenue for 2006 reached approximately $3.3 billion, also a record for SanDisk. We scaled the business at a rapid pace of 2005 and this required tremendous efforts from our employees, our manufacturing and supply base and our distribution channels. I am proud of the entire SanDisk team and the results we achieved.  In 2006, the OEM business contributed more than half of our annual revenue increase due to the strength in our mobile business. I would also like to point out that the regions outside of North America grew more than 70% of the increase in 2006 product revenue on a standalone SanDisk basis. We believe our strategy of building and promoting SanDisk's global brand and increasing our focus on the Asian and European markets is working well.  We increased our revenue market share in the US from 46% to 48% and we increased our global footprint in every major region we serve. In particular, our overall market share in Europe and Asia increased by approximately two percentage points to about 20% and 24% respectively. Even with these share gains our market share outside the US still represents relatively low penetration and hence we believe that there is a significant growth opportunity ahead that we plan to adjust with greater focus in 2007.  Demand elasticity remained strong in all of our key markets. While pricing moved more aggressively than original expectations, fourth quarter average retail capacity as well as our total unit sales doubled from the previous year resulting in rapid growth of our business.  2006 was a year when our mobile business began to meaningfully ramp, achieving 25% of our total consolidated revenue for the year. The mobile business benefited from the continued adoption of the microSD card slot in mobile phones, and this drove unit shipments of our microSD cards to increase more than three fold on a year-over-year basis making it our top selling product in terms of units sold. We added nearly 37,000 mobile retail store fronts during 2006 bringing the total to about 67,000 and that has enabled our mobile retail revenue to nearly triple from the previous year.  Our MP3 business performed extremely well in the fourth quarter, the revenue growing 74% and unit sales doubling, both on a year-over-year basis. We maintained a clear number two shared market share in the US while growing both our 2006 unit and revenue market share by a couple of percentage points from 2005 according to NPD.  Moving on to technology and operations, SanDisk along with Toshiba executed exceptionally well and we exceeded our plant production ramp plans in Fab 3. The total capacity increasing to 90,000 wafers per month at the end of Q4, for approximately the same investment as previously forecasted. We now expect Fab 3 output to increase to approximately 135,000 wafer outs per month by the end of 2007. We are beginning the transition to 56-nanometer technology on 300-millimeter wafers with production shipments scheduled to begin later in this quarter.  In addition, we plan to launch our Monolithic 16-Gigabit MLC NAND chip into production on 56-nanometer technology by the end of Q2. The 56-nanometer conversion coupled with increased Fab 3 wafer output is expected to give us the ability to scale our business and to continue to aggressively reduce our product costs during 2007.  The construction schedule of Fab 4 remains on track and we expect first production output near the end of 2007.  Our captive backend test and assembly facility under construction in Shanghai, remains on track for production output in the fourth quarter of 2007, and that should provide us additional flexibility in accommodating new product and technology transitions and seasonal demand fluctuations. While also further, loading our captive manufacturing product costs.  I am pleased with the progress we are making in creating and driving new demand through innovation. At the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show, we introduced our first 32 Gigabyte solid state drive, three new media players and three new USB products, which we believe will fuel new demand later this year. These announcements along with several others we have in the pipeline reflect a greater diversification of our product portfolio and we expect this trend to continue to propel us on a path towards becoming a consumer electronics powerhouse.  On the Sansa line of products, the Express, the Connect and the View, broaden our product offerings in the audio/video segment. At the low-end, the Express at $59 has a USB connection eliminating the need for cable connection to the PC. The Connect, allows consumers to download, recommend and share music wirelessly. According to Gartner Dataquest, flash based portable video player unit (inaudible) is expected to increase more than five-folds between 2006 and 2010. We believe that the Sansa View, our first portable video player, which is a sleek 8 gigabyte, pocket-sized, portable media device, with remarkably rich video capabilities, is well positioned for this market.  USBTV is another exciting concept we announced at CES, targeted to drive demand for high capacity flash storage. This affordable device will allow consumers to take their selected video content from the PC and play it on their TV. We believe our products are positioned well to benefit from the ongoing shift from an era of user generated content to user acquired and shared content.  SanDisk also announced at CES, that we are a premier partner of Microsoft's worldwide Vista launch, with a specific focus on a new feature called ReadyBoost. Our ReadyBoost compliant high capacity USB drives and flashcards target to improve performance of the Vista based computers and we believe that these products are well positioned to benefit from the imminent trend of the Vista operating system.  We announced our first 32-Gigabyte 1.8 inch solid state drive, SSD, with shipments expected to begin in the first half of this year.  msystems we have acquired customer relationships and leading products to develop the SSD segment, which we believe will be a highly price elastic, high growth business for SanDisk. According to market research, SSDs will be integrated in over $31 million notebook PCs by 2010, representing a penetration rate of about 20%. We believe that the implementation of MLC NAND in SSDs, will only accelerate the adoption rate of SSDs, due to the associated cost benefits, and we believe our MLC and controller system product leadership, puts us in the driver seat to deliver high performance, cost effective and reliable SSDs for PCs.  These two new products announcements, the 32 Gigabyte solid state drive, and USBTV concept were enabled by msystems. Speaking of msystems Limited or msystems, the integration process is going well. We are excited about the new products, markets, customers, channels, innovation and the people that the acquisition brings to our combined company. We are seeing a higher level of customer interest in our product offerings, as a direct result of the expanded nature of our product portfolio, following the acquisition of msystems. We plan to also leverage the msystems team to accelerate our international growth by creating differentiated strategies in different geographies.  Looking at 2007 and beyond the projected demand drivers for NAND Flash continues to look very strong, and we remain bullish about our future. We have always operated in a price elastic environment and we believe that demand for our products will only accelerate as NAND becomes even more affordable. In mobile phones for example, we're beginning to see better screens and more powerful processors supporting the advent of video as illustrated by recent announcements of the Samsung Ultra Music phone and Nokia's N95 phone, with the Nokia phone offering 30 frames per second video capture capability. Apple with the announcement of iPhone has raised the bar for multimedia handsets to require four and eight gigabytes of flash memory.  All of these trends moving to steep increases in average capacity for both flash cards and embedded solutions in the mobile phone space. We believe multiple mega-markets such as music and video phones, Vista enabled PCs, SSDs, and video imaging and content applications will further accelerate the growth in the average capacity and product demand supported by attractive price points, lead by aggressive NAND technology and manufacturing roadmap.  On the supply side, there has been some build up of NAND component supply beginning in December, resulting in steep declines in market pricing in the last few weeks. The industry has been adding MLC NAND capacity faster than demand growth in the seasonally slower first quarter. While we're encouraged by the marks made by some of our competitors that they plan to reallocate NAND capacity to DRAM indicating that the self-corrective nature of this industry is already acclaimed, and we expect this will lead to better demand/supply balance for the NAND industry in 2007, the pricing environment remains difficult to predict.  Despite the challenging industry environment, our vertically integrated model and strong OEM and retail relationships put us in an advantageous position to sell all of our memory output in the consumer products that we design and sell.  Given all the demand drivers that I just described, we are bullish on the industry demand bit growth in 2007 and we expect our growth rate will likely exceed that of the market growth rate estimates made by third party industry analysts.  Following a record setting fourth quarter in 2006, we expect the first quarter of 2007 to show typical seasonality in the retail channel with a pronounced seasonal slowdown for MP3 players. In addition, given the current pricing environment, we have decided to deemphasize the former msystems private label business for now in order to focus our sales efforts on the more profitable SanDisk branded products. Let me add that the former msystems mobile business remains solid, and in fact, it is poised to leverage our captive supply base to serve the growing needs of existing and new customers.  To summarize, the fourth quarter and the full year 2006 were record periods. SanDisk is a unique company in the highly innovative consumer electronic space and our key strengths are in creating and growing new markets, designing leading edge technology and innovative products, a highly flexible cost supply chain, valuable IP and strong balance sheet. We continue to invest in driving our growth and we believe that we are well positioned to face the opportunities and challenges as we drive to make SanDisk a global consumer electronics powerhouse.  I will now turn the call to Judy. 
Judy Bruner: Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon everyone. We had a very strong Q4 and 2006, and to provide you with better clarity on our results, I will organize my comments in three major buckets. First, I will discuss our SanDisk's standalone non-GAAP results for the quarter and the year. Second, I will describe the non-GAAP results for the former msystems business from our acquisition day of November 19th through the end of 2006. And finally, I will describe the GAAP adjustments for stock compensation and acquisition accounting.  In order to make it easier for you to follow my comments, we have posted to our SanDisk's website at SanDisk.com in the IR section two charts that show you these components of our GAAP results. The first chart is for Q4 and the second chart is for the full year 2006.  So let's start with SanDisk's standalone results. SanDisk's standalone fourth quarter product revenue of $964 million was up 43% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Our SanDisk's standalone megabyte sold increased sequentially 73% compared to our previous forecast of 50% to 60%. And our ASP per megabyte fell 17% within our forecasted range of 15% to 20%. Our strongest sequential growth in both units and megabytes was in our Sansa MP3 products, which comprise 14% of our product revenue in the fourth quarter.  Looking at our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis for Q4, our strongest growth in revenue dollars was from the mobile market followed by the MP3 market. For the full year of 2006, our SanDisk's standalone product revenue grew 36% over 2005, an accelerated growth rate from the 29% we enjoyed in 2005. This demonstrates the power of elasticity in our markets resulting from a 58% price decline in ASP per megabyte for average 2006, compared to 2005.  Our standalone royalty revenue for the fourth quarter was $84 million, slightly below our previous forecast, due primarily to licensee pricing. For the full year, our royalty revenue was $330 million, grew by 38% over 2005.  Looking at the breakdown of our SanDisk standalone revenue for the full year, the most significant changes were that the mix of mobile handset related revenue, doubled from 13% to 26%, MP3 related revenue grew from 6% to 9%, and digital imaging related revenue went from 52% to 39%, again, of our standalone revenue. Its worth noting that our revenue from the relatively more mature digital imaging market still grew to 2% year-over-year during a year of steep price decline.  Our standalone non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 was 34.7%. Towards the upper end of the range we had forecasted, and up 200 basis points from Q3, benefiting from strong 70-nanometer memory cost reduction in the 300-millimeter fab. Shipments made with non-captive memory were less than 5%, and consistent with our plan.  For the full year 2006, our standalone non-GAAP product gross margin was 32.6%, within the 32% to 35% range we forecasted at the start of the year.  SanDisk Q4 standalone non-GAAP operating expense grew $29 million sequentially with the highest growth due to holiday related sales and marketing expenses. Our non-GAAP standalone operating margin was 23.7% for Q4 and 21.8% for the year, in the middle of the 20% to 24% operating model we have previously provided.  The msystems business acquired on November 19th added $115 million of revenue to Q4, at a product gross margin of 13%. The six weeks of former msystems sales consisted of approximately 50% private label USB sales, approximately 25% embedded mobile and industrial applications; and approximately 25% from the consolidation of the Toshiba-msystems joint venture called [TWIMSYS].  During the six-week period, the former msystems business utilized almost entirely non-captive memory supply and generated a slight non-GAAP loss. With the addition of the legacy msystems from November 19, our total consolidated revenue was $1.16 billion for Q4 and $3.26 billion for the year. Our total non-GAAP product gross margin was 32.3% for Q4 and 31.8% for the full-year and total non-GAAP operating margin was 21.3% for Q4 and 21% for the year.  Our non-GAAP annual tax rate was reduced from 35% to 33.5% based on a favorable evolution in the distribution of processes around the world and the reinstatement of the US R&D tax credit.  Our fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted shares of approximately 220 million reflect the addition of approximately 16 million shares on a six-week weighted basis for the shares issued and stock incentives assumed for the msystems acquisition. Resulting non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87 for the fourth quarter, up 28% from Q4 of last year and $2.51 for 2006 up 25% over 2005.  Now I will comment on the GAAP adjustments to our results. Stock compensation expense was 31 million for Q4, and 101 million for 2006. Purchase accounting adjustments included three different components: First, the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. Second, the additional cost of sales created from the write-up of finished goods inventory to net realizable value. And third, the write-off of in-process technology, which is not benefited in the tax rate. You can see each of these GAAP adjustments for Q4 and for the year on our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, including these adjustments and the related tax effects, our fourth quarter GAAP results, or a net loss of $35 million.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3.3 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments, up $295 million from the third quarter, with approximately $143 million coming from the former msystems business as of the end of the year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was 184 million, up from 79 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Accounts receivable for the SanDisk standalone business remained at a fairly consistent level of 42 days sales outstanding and the msystems acquisition added 168 million to accounts receivable as of December 31. Inventory ended the year at $496 million, up $100 million from Q3, primarily due to the addition of the msystems' related inventory. Fab 3 equipment investments were funded by an operating lease drawdown of approximately $195 million in the fourth quarter and our total net operating lease guarantee now stands at approximately $654 million.  I will now turn to our future outlook. I will limit my specific guidance to the first quarter of 2007, although I will provide you some color on the year. Given the changing characteristics of our business, I will provide you with a specific revenue range for the first quarter and be less specific about the change in megabytes and the decline in blended ASP per megabyte.  Our product portfolio is becoming increasingly diverse with significant differences by a product in ASP per megabyte and average capacity. We are seeing this with the increase in mix of MP3 products and with the acquisition of msystems embedded products, and we will see this even more with the introduction and anticipated growth of some of our recently announced consumer products, such as USB TV, Sansa View and Solid State Drives to name a few. And we are now consolidating the results of the [TWIMSYS] joint venture with Toshiba, which we acquired with msystems. As a result, the blended average ASP per megabyte is becoming less meaningful and more difficult to predict, especially in Q1, which is apples-to-oranges with our reported Q4.  There are four key factors that we expect will influence our first quarter revenue. First, we expect retail unit demand to exhibit typical Q1 seasonality, which would be down from Q4 and becoming more pronounced as MP3s have become a larger portion of our product mix. Second, we expect our mobile OEM business to remain strong and grow in units from Q4 to Q1. The third factor is that while we will have a full quarter of msystems in Q1, we are expecting the former msystems' private label USB business to decline very significantly from Q4 to Q1, as typical seasonality is exacerbated by current aggressive industry pricing and our decision in this environment to focus on building our more profitable branded business relevant sale at lower margins to third party brands.  Finally, the fourth factor is pricing and megabytes sold. It has been evident in the first month of Q1 that the flash industry is experiencing oversupply and prices have been coming down rapidly. We expect Q1 to be a period of steep price decline with the ASP per megabyte for most of our products falling more than it did during Q4 and we expect total megabytes sold to decline from Q4 to Q1 given retail seasonality coupled with our shift away from the private label business.  The four factors I have just outlined lead us to forecast Q1 product revenue of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a sequential decline of approximately 25% to 35% from our consolidated Q4. Based on recent comments by our key licensees, we are forecasting our royalty revenue to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for Q1. This reflects our estimate of a decline in our licensees Q4 licensable revenue, but with a shift in mix toward higher royalty bearing MLC memory.  Turning to gross margin, our pricing expectations lead us to forecast a Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin of 24% to 28% compared to our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 32.3% in Q4 '06. This forecast reflects a mix of approximately 10% non-captive memory in our Q1 revenue. We expect Q1 GAAP product gross margin to be lower by approximately four points, due primarily to the inclusion of stock compensation and acquisition related purchase accounting charges.  We forecast Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $195 to $200 million reflecting the inclusion of a full quarter of the former msystems business with some offset from the seasonal decline of certain sales and marketing expenses. We forecast Q1 GAAP operating expenses to be higher by approximately $40 million due to stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets.  Other forecasts for Q1 include other income between $30 and $32 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. In addition, our net income will reflect a reduction for the after-tax minority interest in the [TWIMSYS] joint venture, which we forecasted approximately $5 million for the first quarter. We forecast Q1 diluted shares to be approximately $238 million, including a full quarter of the shares issued and stock incentive assumed for the msystems acquisition and our plan to begin repurchasing shares under our previously announced repurchased program.  Turning to the balance sheet, we expect inventory to increase in Q1 based on the seasonality of sales. Our strong sell-through in Q4 2006 benefited from the availability of inventory, early in the fourth quarter, and I am optimistic about achieving the same benefit in Q2 of 2007.  We do not expect to make any significant Fab venture investments or loans in Q1, but we do expect to execute a $215 million drawdown against the SanDisk portion of the Fab 3 operating lease facilities. Non-Fab capital expenditures are forecasted as approximately 70 million in Q1, including equipment and building expenditures for our captive backend factory. I will provide a more comprehensive update of Fab and other capital investments on our February Analysts' Day.  Now I will provide a few comments on 2007. As Sanjay described earlier, we see strong demand drivers in 2007, resulting from continued price decline. As we project the pricing environment for 2007, we believe that given the steep price decline in Q1, ASP per megabyte is likely to decline at least 50% in 2007. If the current level of supply-demand imbalance in the market persists, the price decline for 2007 will be more.  If prices decline approximately 50% for the year, we expect strong megabyte growth and an improvement in the gross margins we have guided to for Q1. If prices decline in the range of recent quarters, which has been 60% plus on a year-over-year basis then we would expect even stronger megabyte growth, but with continued margin pressure and potentially little growth in royalty revenue.  We do not believe that this industry will exhibit a prolonged period of 60% plus price decline, because its leaders, ourselves included, cannot consistently reduce costs at that rate. We believe the market will self correct and that we are already seeing signs of that self correction.  On the supply side, certain component suppliers are shifting capacity to DRAM and on the demand side the new lower price points are opening up very large new markets, which we are pursuing aggressively, such as solid state drives for example.  Our industry is characterized by short periods of supply-demand imbalance, which can result in challenging margins as we are expecting during Q1. However, we are managing SanDisk for the long-term, which we believe has significant growth opportunity. So while we are working to limit expense growth, we will continue to invest in innovation and in scaling the company. Our primary investments and focus over the next several months include introduction of recently announced products, integration of the former msystems business, execution of the 56-nanometer transition and completion of Fab 4. We expect to incur Fab 4 startup costs in 2007, similar in magnitude to the startup costs we incurred in 2005 for Fab 3. The Fab 4 startup costs in Q1 are at a fairly low level and have been included in the guidance I provided for expenses and gross margins. For Q2 through Q4, we forecast approximately $50 million of Fab 4 startup costs. We expect approximately $40 million to be recorded as R&D, spread over Q2 through Q4 and approximately $10 million to be recorded as cost of sales in the fourth quarter as the Fab goes into production.  In summary we are very pleased with our strong Q4 and 2006 performance and we firmly believe that we are uniquely positioned to build on our leading market share with continued investments and technology, and innovative consumer products. We will now open the call for your questions. 
Lori Barker Padon: Thank you. Could you limit your questions please to one or two questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We go first to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good evening. Thanks so much. First question is on the self-correcting aspect of the capacity situation or excess capacity situation that you talked about. We all know about Samsung may be doing something and Hynix may be doing a little something in terms of NAND to DRAM. How about yourselves? Are you going to be part of that self-correcting mechanism? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So in terms of our own capacity RAM, we believe we are able to sell all of the capacity that we can manufacture. And in fact, we are targeting to sell our output, as I said in my script, in global regions as well and we see strong growth drivers coming on. The growth drivers I talked about, increased average capacity in mobile phones, video, portable video players, etcetera. That we believe will allow us to continue to use our output and basically sell it. In fact in the second half of the year, we see ourselves purchasing some non-captive supply itself. So I don't think for our business it makes sense reduce our capacity production. Of course, we always have the flexibility of non-captive supply, just like over last couple of quarters we turned down the non-captive supply to significantly less than 10%. We have that option going forward as well and we plan to dial it back up in the second half of the year. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So, if I could ask a follow-up on that, in my view, it's not really a question of if you can sell it. I think we all agree that you could sell it. It's a question at what price you could sell it? And if you as the industry leader isn't going to cut back on the capacity ramp then what makes you feel comfortable that everybody else is going to. This is a game of chicken in some senses where if my competitor isn't going to back down then neither am I. So, how can you be supremely confident that your competitors are going to be as aggressive as they need to be on the capacity roll back if you're not going to be? 
Judy Bruner: Jim, this is Judy. Let me add that our bit growth in 2007 will naturally be quiet a bit less than it was in 2006, given the aggressive ramp we had in our Fab 3 in 2006. Fab 3 in 2007 will be reaching full capacity by the end of the year and the ramp is not nearly as steep in 2007 as it was in 2006. And of course Fab 4 will not really result in salable output until 2008. So, we have no plans to slowdown our fab capacity ramp for Fab 3 or for Fab 4, but by its very nature, the growth in that bit output will be quiet a bit less in 2007 then in 2006. And that's why Sanjay said in fact to meet the demand that we would expect in 2007. We anticipate e that we would be dialing up non-captive in the second half of the year. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: And also we have to look at this thing in the long-term picture. And in the long-term, we see the demand for flash continuing to grow. Industry projections as shown here are moving from 650 petabytes last year to something like 13,000 petabytes in 2010, and with that kind of a scenario we have to with our leadership with us being in the driver seat, we have to continue to grow the demand, create the markets, and fulfill that with the supply. So, we really cannot just have one quarter or two quarter excess that may be going on till December timeframe determine our decisions regarding capacity cutbacks. We really are looking at the long-term demand pictures and positioning ourselves to be in the driver seat in that market. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Final question from me, Fab 5 there has been some speculation that may be Fab 5 -- even though that was only in the planning stages that that could be the Fab that -- maybe you take a little bit more of a cautious view around or your joint venture partner takes cautious view around given the pricing environment, is that consistent with your thoughts on Fab 5? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as you know, that in NAND Flash Toshiba and SanDisk invested jointly. But I must tell you that there have not been any discussions of Fab 5. These are just somehow market rumors and both Toshiba and SanDisk do not have plans for Fab 5. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So there is no plan for a Fab 5 in the first place is what you are saying? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: There is on plan for Fab 5 at this time, yes, in the first place. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Citigroup. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thanks Judy. With the royalty commentary, I know you are not providing specific for your guidance there, but can you tell us if there is any meaningful prospect that you would have an additional source of royalty revenue this year? 
Judy Bruner: Craig, we really can't comment on the potential outcome of litigation or other discussions. So, I really cannot provide a full year royalty revenue estimate at this point. Not so much because of whether or not we would get new licensees, but more that the pricing environment is uncertain for the remainder of the year. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay. And then switching gears, you mentioned a couple of times that new products that were announced at CES, how should we think about the gross margin percentage of those new products relative to the current portfolio, and how can we think about the growth parameters or the volume parameters of those products this year relative to the existing portfolio? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, the new products that we announced, for example, USB flash drives, Vista ReadyBoost flash drives, the gross margins for those products will be similar to our USB line of products. The other products that announced USB TV and the Sansa products, on the low-end, of Sansa Express and the Sansa Connect products those will continue to carry in margins that are similar to our audio/video line of products. As you know, that we are very much focused on scaling our business in the audio video space and as we scale up that business, basically we expect improved gross margins going forward with our focus on intense cost reductions for that product line as well. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: So to clarify, you expect improved gross margins on those products, but those products are noticeably below the corporate average, aren't they Sanjay? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: The audio/video products tend to be below the corporate average, yes. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: And again, because they do not yet have the benefit of the scale, and as you see that in Q4 we were driving that and we will continue to drive those products in global regions. That continues to drive the unit demand as well as broaden the product portfolio and that we believe will give us cost benefits, cost synergies and possibilities of improvements in gross margin. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: And you think you get there in 2007 or is there really something you are going to do in 2008? Or you meaningfully improve the gross margin structure in those businesses? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, we will continue to work on in it in 2007. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in this audio/video space. If you look at just Europe, we made very good progress in Q4 in penetrating Europe and in 2007 for audio/video, we want to basically go global and I would absolutely expect [then] our focus to continue to gain share and improve solidly our business in audio/video in 2007. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thanks Judy. Thanks Sanjay. 
Operator: We go next to Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Yeah hi guys. Starting with you, Sanjay, on cell phone, in terms of cell phone demand with iPhone getting into 4 and 8 gigabyte embedded. From your point of view, your customers or carriers, are they asking for 4 and 8 gigabyte microSD, and if so basically what do you see for the cell phone business in 2007? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Actually we are seeing the demand definitely in high capacity microSD, but in embedded solutions as well, and as you know, through msystems, we have further strengthened our product portfolio on the embedded side. So we are seeing demand for 4 gigabyte, 8 gigabyte capacities for embedded, as well as cards. And for sure, later this year, we'll have 4 gigabyte microSD product, and we have complete lineup of embedded solutions as well. So basically we're expecting that with the iPhone announcement, with what the handset manufacturers and the carriers are indicating to us in terms of their interest in pushing the phones to the video capabilities to the high quality music, as well as to high-end camera applications. We actually expect in the mobile space for the average capacity to perhaps move even faster than what it has done in the past, with all these applications coming in. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay. So can you clarify what average capacities it would reach by the end of '07 for the mobile phone segment? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: I would expect -- I can't nail it down, but I would expect the average capacity is really over next four to six quarters to start approaching 4 gigabyte plus on an average basis. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay. Moving on -- one question for Judy. Judy can you -- given the guidance of $700 million to $800 million. I just wanted some clarification here in terms of the discontinuation of msystems, private label, USB drives. How much of that basically is falling off on an apples-to-apples basis. And the second question I just wanted make sure for the year, in terms of gross margins with all this NAND, non-NAND related, whether it's Wi-Fi based or a flash video iPod products. Where can we expect gross margins for the year to go below 30% margins, compared to historical 33% to 35%? Can you shed some light please? 
Judy Bruner: Okay. So, let me comment on your two questions. First of all on the private label business, the private label business within msystems has generally been about half of their product revenue and as I said for the six-weeks that it was included in our consolidated Q4 results, it was also about half of the revenue. So we are not going to break it out in terms of the $700 million to $800 million, but you can get an idea of the size of it in the past, and it is coming down significantly based on our decision to focus on the more profitable SanDisk branded business.  In terms of gross margins, and you are asking non-NAND components and perhaps that putting pressure on margins -- let me address that and also comment back on Craig Ellis' question in this area, and that is that while going forward, some of these audio/video related products will typically have a gross margin, that is somewhat below the corporate average. The embedded products that we have just acquired from the msystems acquisition, both in the mobile space as well as other embedded applications, tend to have a higher than corporate average gross margin. So there is a mix of new product lines coming in to our gross margin and we really can not predict at this point in time, how that will sort out. But I think -- there is both lower and higher than average. In terms of gross margin for the year, we are not going to put a stake in the ground at this point in terms of a gross margin for 2007 for all of the reasons that I described. We have given the range for Q1. And beyond Q1, I have given some color on the pricing parameters, but at this point, we are uncertain as to pricing beyond Q1. 
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay. Thank you, Judy. 
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Hi, can you hear me? 
Judy Bruner: Yes. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: I have three quick questions. First of all, Judy, you mentioned that the licensing revenues came in slightly short of expectations and you attributed it to pricing. What did you mean by that? 
Judy Bruner: What I mean by that is our royalty revenue is based on a rate that is applied against the licensees' licensable revenue. So, if they have steep price declines in a given period, then that is going to depress the licensable revenue. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: And that's, therefore is factored in thinking about licensing through the remainder of the year? 
Judy Bruner: Correct. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Second question, I know it's less meaningful and it used to be, but the total bit shipments including msystems and the total ASP per megabyte decline for the fourth quarter, are you in a position to share those numbers? 
Judy Bruner: In the ASP, really it's not a sensible number because it is only included for the six-week period, and it's not necessarily comparable to what we will see in Q1. If you think about it in Q4, the msystems business was heavier towards the USB private label business in Q1, and in Q1, we would expect it to be heavier towards the embedded business. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then, my last question, Sanjay, as you think about your cost curve and therefore probably the industry's price curve to some extent, how does it change? Does the price -- the cost decline accelerate round about the time of the 55-nanometer, 300-millimeter activation or is there some other event that we should be thinking about in the sort of '07-'08 timeframe that will take the cost curve down in the sort of step function fashion? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, in terms of cost, we have said that in general, on an average, year-in-year-out, cost come down by about 40% to 50% per year basis. So, this year in 2007, the decline in the cost will primarily be determined by our ramp of 56-nanometer technology. As we said, 56-nanometer we are just starting that in Q1 timeframe. But in terms of the effect of this -- the full effect of the 56-nanometer, we have said before, we will really start experiencing the benefit of that in the Q3 timeframe, mainly because of, again, its application to the retail products and the amount of time it takes for retail products to sell through the channel.  So, the 56-nanometer, as it ramps up into production, we will basically linearly essentially drive the cost reductions and our ability to transition the wafers to 56-nanometer during the course of the year as well as continue to improve use of 56-nanometer is what will determine the ongoing cost improvement that we will realize on a per megabyte basis during the course of the year. So, in terms of step transitions with 56-nanometer, it's not a step transition because it is determined by wafer ramp and yield improvement. The step transitions really come about when you go to a new technology such as potentially the volume production of x4 or 3 bit-per-cell etcetera. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: And when will we see x4? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: x4 we're actually making some good progress in terms of the engineering development and applying that technology to system level, applying our systems level expertise to their technology. But really, we'll not have any meaningful shipments of that product in 2007. It's more -- you'll see some impact of it in 2008 timeframe. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, got it. Thank you. 
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot guys. Few questions, the first one for you Sanjay. When will we see the crossover in 56-nanometer here this year on a wafer start basis? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Do you mean crossover in terms of bit cost of 56-nanometer and 70-nanometer? 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Yeah, I was just thinking not cost but just total wafers 56-nanometer starts crossing over 70? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We plan to ramp it up aggressively. At this point, we're really not disclosing the plan ramp for 56-nanometer. It is just at the very beginning at this point, Mark. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay. So it sounds like best case is really somewhere in the second-half of the year anyways? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Okay. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Question was on msystems then for you Judy, when you look at their absolute revenues for Q1, given the fact that you had ownership for just six weeks in the fourth quarter. Do you expect those revenues to be flat or actually decline in absolute dollars quarter-to-quarter? 
Judy Bruner: So again I am not going to break out this specific amount of msystems revenue in Q1. But I think -- you can get approximately there based on the comment that we had six-weeks in Q4 and about half of that business was USB private label, which we are significantly deemphasizing, alright. So, one can sort of assume that if you go from six-weeks to 13 weeks, and then takeaway what was about half of -- most what was about half the revenue you can get there. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's what I was trying to clear figure out. It's flattish -- 
Judy Bruner: Yeah. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Still declines in total dollars. And then if I heard you correctly, I think you said that the product gross margins for the company on a non-GAAP basis will be 24 to 28% in the quarter, if you did not have the msystems business, what would the non-GAAP product gross margins for SanDisk be in the first quarter? 
Judy Bruner: I would tell you that we do not expect the msystems business to materially depress our gross margin, because of two reasons, one is that most of the business that will remain is the higher margin embedded business, and second we are moving pretty aggressively to utilization of captive supply for the msystems business. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Fair enough, thanks for that and then just two very brief ones. One, you gave the year-over-year growth rate in MP3 for Q4, what was it sequentially in both revenues and units, if you can share that? 
Judy Bruner: The MP3 unit and revenue growth from Q3 to Q4 was approximately 150%. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Congratulations on that. Then just lastly, where are inventories in the channel now in terms of days or weeks? 
Judy Bruner: So when we talk about channel inventory, we always give it on a backward looking basis to be consistent, and on a backward looking basis, channel inventory ended at about six-weeks at the end of Q4, and that compares to about seven-weeks at the end of Q4 of last year. 
Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for the questions. I appreciate it. 
Operator: We will go next to Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Yeah, hi. I guess you can't provide the ASP guidance for the combined company, but can you provide, I guess on an apples-to-apples comparison, if you were to look at just ASPs for SanDisk on a standalone basis in Q1? 
Judy Bruner: No, we are not going to break that out. But as I said, we expect the ASP per megabyte for most of our products, will fall more in Q1 than it did in Q4. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Right. Is that a bottom-end to that range? 
Judy Bruner: We are not going to project the range at this point. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: I guess my second question is, can you update us on the progress on 3 bits-per-cell sell in terms of when we might be able to see something on that end? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think with respect to 3 bit-per-cell, probably in terms of any production, early part of next year. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: And if you have production on 3 bits-per-cell in the early part of next year and how do you think that could affect your negotiating stance on people you want to get royalty from or renegotiate royalty agreements from? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We do believe that those that manufacture NAND Flash as well as (inaudible) that are involved in system level products, do need license to our IP. But the impact of 3D or MLC or some of our other system level or device level patents. I mean this is really all, part of overall IP licensing policy, I would not really provide any comment or detail on the specific impact of one particular innovation or one particular IP aspect on the overall impact -- overall IP license. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Operator: We will go next to Eric Gomberg with Thomas Weisel Partners 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi thanks very much. I was wondering, if you could expand on mobile. I think in the opening remarks, you said that you expect dividends to be up strongly in Q1 or continue to be up in Q1, could you talk about the type of ASP pressure you may be seeing in mobile and also you gave a lot of color on revenue and mobile year-over-year in '06, could you talk that may be the unit volumes '07 versus '06 from the design activity that you already have booked? 
Judy Bruner: So, Eric, you're asking -- I did say that we expect unit growth to occur from Q4 to Q1 in the mobile business. And as I said, we really expect to see price decline in Q1 in all of our product lines including mobile, but we're not giving a specific range. The pricing environment is challenging really for all product lines today, retail and OEM, although retail is probably a bit more challenging. Your second question was with regard to 2007 growth? 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yeah, just trying to get a sense of your -- when you look at say bundling activity, from where you see today what the unit volumes may grow year-over-year? It would seem that grew well over 100% last year? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We would definitely see a strong growth in bundling as well in 2007. If you look at last year, about 250 million card slotted phones shipped. And 2007 projection is -- there are multiple numbers out there, but anywhere 400 million plus for 2007. So clearly, the increase in units we believe will still continue to result in increase in bundling. There are a more and more phones that are getting designed in with card slots. Actually the last count is about 700 phones that have -- 700 different models that have card slots and more than half of them are microSD card slots. And so, we fully expect that bundling trend in 2007 will continue in the mobile space. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Could you talk about 3D memory and where you stand in terms of bringing that up to leading edge geometries and chip capacities, and your thoughts right now -- or your thoughts on opportunity in preloaded content? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, the 3D business in terms of the preloaded content is basically going well, going per our expectations. And we have said before, that we will have the 3D products convert from under 30-nanometer to 80-nanometer technology in the second half of this year and that is still proceeding per plan. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. And I guess just one last question, I've realized you don't have great pricing visibility beyond Q1 or even necessarily in Q1, wondering other than seeing some NAND capacity go back DRAM, are there any catalyst other than typical Mothers Day, Father Day, graduations in Q2 that you see coming in Q2 that should kind of suit the industry pain and stop the price declines? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: You are right. Usually Q2 is strong. We call it like second Christmas, as the second strongest quarter of the year and it tends to drive lot of demand for our products. So, therefore, it will definitely be happening for our sales. We have several new products that we will be starting to ship in Q2. The Sansa -- I mean actually we will start shipping in late Q1 ready for volume production, volume shipments in Q2. These are the Sansa Connect as well as the Sansa Express. And in addition, the new handset models that keep coming out and the mobile growth will continue to drive I believe strong demand in second quarter as well. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: We'll go next to Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Hey guys. Few questions, first of all, just a follow-up on Eric's question with metrics. I know that Eli has talked about in the past about making a breakthrough with regard to 3D read-write, any new visibility on that front? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We are working on that, but really too soon to say anything, and no breakthrough to report yet. Generally, we tend to make announcements once we really ready with the technology, and I think Eli have said that this is something that will take considerable amount of R&D, considerable amount of investments, and we are continuing to do that. It will take two to three years, before this technology really becomes a viable production worthy possibility. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Along the floating gate breakthrough lines, Intel and IBM recently made announcement about using hafnium alloys, which helps their ability to extend Moore's Law, does that have any application to you guys? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: That is done for military transistors. Of course, that has been in the literatures and at various conferences, high-k dielectric has been explored for application to flash memory as well, and there are actually at this point multiple technology approaches that are being looked at to work on scaling of flash. So, I really cannot comment anymore beyond that on this at this point. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: And as far as you stand right now, where do you guys or where does Toshiba believe that they can scale beyond 56-nanometer, [I assume] 45 and 32 are in the mix at this point still? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, we are definitely working on those generations of technologies and we believe the 4X -- we call it 4X, means, 40 something technology node would be the one that will get introduced in 2008 timeframe. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: And finally just on the supply side, I have spoken to lot of a suppliers, who've indicated that supply growth this year on a bit basis will be in the 140% range. Is that something that you find to be consistent and I imagine that's well below the typical average over the last few years? Do you think if that is so, we could see some sort of back half firming of the supply-demand balance? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, the industry estimates are about 140%to 150% in terms of the base growth. We believe that there are enough applications that could be driving the demand to higher requirements than that. We have already said, that for our own needs, we probably will be using non-captive supply in the second half. 
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Thank you very much. Good luck. 
Operator: We will go next to Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes can you comment on the premium that you addressed for SanDisk branded cards and drives in the retail and OEM channel embedded. Can you (inaudible) versus some of your generic competitors? 
Judy Bruner: I am not sure I completely heard the question, but if the question was about the premium that we see between our branded products and other non-branded products in the marketplace. Yes, we continue to be able to sustain a premium for our cards and USB products in that marketplace. And in fact that's part of the reason why it makes sense for us in this environment to focus on our branded products. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And that has held up despite the challenging environment towards the end of Q4, has that brand premium held up or is it narrowing? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Brand premium has certainly held up and it's not like there is a fix formula for brand premium, it is different in different regions based on our strategies for our growth in those regions. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And my second question is given the challenging environment in Q1, can you talk a little bit about your inventory reserves and how you account for any actions that you've to take in terms of either protecting your margin or what's your choice in terms of reserves for the channels? 
Judy Bruner: Sure, good question. Clearly, we took a careful look at our inventory reserves as we always do. And we did factor into our analysis, the pricing that we anticipate, will occur over the next several months as we sell the inventory that we had on hand at the end of the year. And we did in fact take some increased inventory reserves that are reflected in our fourth quarter results, in order to be prudent about the pricing environment. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Great. And Sanjay, can you -- it sounds like you folks, longer-term want to become a more consumer systems company, as well as accelerating those efforts and it seems like you want to become a more branded consumer company versus drifting it out from the flash card and private label market. Can you comment strategically on where you are heading longer-term? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Definitely longer-term, we want to become global consumer powerhouse, and we want to achieve that by bringing new products, new ideas that leverage our technology manufacturing and the vertical integration business model including our worldwide retail sales footprint. So you are absolutely right, that we should not be looked at as a component supplier, because we are really end-to-end solutions provider and continually trying to bring products that are just more than simple storage, basically products that also give user experience. Things such as your Sansa Connect or USBTV etcetera. So yes we are definitely moving in that direction. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Would that mean that you would perhaps lower your capital spending plans going forward and depend more on foundry outsourcing for greater portion of your needs -- beyond this year? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: No, because -- the very factor that gives us the ability to succeed this vertical integration model, is our very cost effective supply. That's what gives us a real differentiator in terms of cost and really ability to penetrate the various value added products into the marketplace. So no, we will absolutely continue to invest and build our asset base in terms of the flash capacity going forward, because that is a very fundamental part of our business model and that's what makes us unique, that we have that flash capacity supply together we have the ability to innovate products and create new markets and really become a consumer powerhouse. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Great. Thank you. 
Judy Bruner: Thanks. We have time for one more caller. 
Operator: We'll take our final call from Pranay Laharia with Deutsche Bank. 
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Hi guys. How big were Sony Ericsson and Samsung in the quarter? 
Judy Bruner: Well, we don't normally break them out right on a quarterly basis. We had mentioned, I believe, it was in the third quarter that Sony Ericsson was at 10% customer for the quarter. This quarter, as you can imagine, retail was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. So I would say that we did not have a 10% OEM customer during the quarter, even though OEM was very strong and we had several OEM customers in the top ten customers. But in the fourth quarter, the sequential growth was more in the retail space. 
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay, fair enough. And just last question, can you give an update on the legal front, important base etcetera, to keep in mind particularly against ST Micro [that you lost] in the second half? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of ST Micro, we completed the ITC trial in December and the initial determination will be made in June. The judge had some health problems recently, therefore it has been pushed out, and the final determination would be, I believe the date is for October timeframe. But anyway the initial judgment is in June timeframe, and with respect to the other cases related to ST Micro, they are basically proceeding on their own schedule and nothing specific to report there. 
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much. Again I must congratulate the team on a year of excellent revenue growth, innovation and expansion into new markets. On behalf of Eli and our Executive team, I look forward to speaking to you on our upcoming Analyst Day on February 26. Thank you very much.

Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Eli Harari.
Eli Harari – Chairman, CEO: Thank you, Lori. In SanDisk's third quarter we continued to see the positive trends of our mobile comps that began several quarters ago. In Q3 the number of enhanced handsets that have a slot for a mobile card jumped to 648 models from 494 models in the prior quarter. Fully 49% of these models now support the microSD format including numerous new models from Nokia. Last week we announced our 2 gigabyte microSD cards in Japan in support of our launch of NTT DoCoMo where they release their older model such as new generation 3G phone that support microSD for the first time. Additionally, Sony Erickson in the third quarter was a 10% customer, and three out of our top 10 customers in third quarter were mobile card -- mobile phone manufacturers. In 2007 we expect high capacity mobile cards demand to accelerate particularly from the adoption of MP3 music, camera phones, with 3 to 7 megapixel resolution and the emergence of video in handsets as seen with the YouTube phenomenon. With the sheer number of handsets sold annually approaching the billion dollar mark we view the handset market opportunity for our cards and embedded solutions as the most important engine of Flash storage demand creation over the next few years. In the gaming segment we saw excellent sales growth of one-time programmable preloaded 3D cards. This is a 3D one-time programmable cards, and we are optimistic about the future prospect for 3D one-time programmable memory technology as an attractive content distribution medium for portable consoles and media players. In Flash MP3 players our U.S. retail unit share increased to 18% in August according to MPD and we continue to receive excellent reviews and customer interest for our Sansa e200 high-end players. Two weeks ago Best Buy and RealNetworks launched the Best Buy digital music store, it will be based on the new Sansa e200R which is especially optimized to work with real exciting new Rhapsody DNA. We believe that our strategy for penetrating this important market is working for us and that growing number of consumers are responding favorably to our value proposition and to the freedom of choice and access to protected content through an open platform. We believe that the corporation with Best Buy is indicative of the desire of major retailers to develop a compelling alternative to Apple’s iPod. The personal media player PMP market is just around the corner. We have begun supplying Disney with preloaded movie cards on SD cards that are protected by our trusted Flash content protection security. These exciting new Disney PMP's which are shipping for the holidays in U.S. stores are targeted at kids 9 to 12 years old. The Disney PMP player sells for $99, and they are offering 6 full featured kid movies on these protected SD cards at 19.95 each, basically the same price as that of a DVD. We are very excited about this development, and we believe this market for preprogrammed premier content will grow nicely in the years ahead, both in standalone PMP players and more importantly in future handsets. In USB Flash drives, U3 recently announced the signing of the 10,000 application developer. U3 addresses the effect that standard USB Flash drives are basically an over performer as a floppy replacement but an under performer as a smart drive. Further more in the corporate world USB Flash drives are today viewed as a security risk by most IT departments. U3 applications are currently being developed by numerous corporations and third party developers and as the platform for smart personal storage space that is highly secured as well as corporate IT friendly. We believe the new U3 devices will dramatically transform the way mobile professionals work. The launch of Microsoft's Vista will further encourage Vista users to employ ready boost and ready drive Flash based devices to improve system performance. Speaking of personal computers, there is a growing interest in the growing NAND Flash memory in both desktop and notebook PC's. This trend goes handy with the view that proliferation of broadband will foster so called network service in the cloud to store a vast amount of personal data and communicate with personal computing platforms. This proliferation would create an opportunity for 10 to 20 gigabytes of on board non-Flash storage at the expense of resident hard drives. For this to happen, we believe the cost of Flash needs to come down by factors 2 to 4 times which we believe is well within the industry's ability in the next two years. Turning to the business side, aggressive pricing in the third quarter resulted in a 25% reduction in our ASP per megabytes sold. We were able to maintain product gross margins at the same level as in the prior quarter through excellent Flash yields on our captive 70 nanometer NAND MLC. We also completed the transition of Fab 3 from 90 nanometer to 70 nanometer and leveraged a strong growth in captive megabytes to reduce our third quarter reliance on the more costly non-captive sources. We believe that our vertical integration business model executed at the leading edge of non-MLC is allowing us to do well even under the challenging market conditions that have existed over the past few quarters. Looking forward to the fourth quarter we believe that Flash demand and supply are in reasonably good balance. Seasonally, strong Flash demand in consumer electronics in the fourth quarter is expected to absorb the existing and new supply coming onto the market. We're pleased to see some DRAM/NAND suppliers scrambling to increase their DRAM output by either diverting non-starts to DRAM or building new DRAM capacity ahead of NAND. This is due not only to the higher DRAM content required in Vista compliant computers but also due to the 60% or so traffic line of NAND in the past year that has made NAND substantially less profitable than DRAM except for those players that are at the leading edge NAND MLC. Just a few words on the M-System acquisition until the closing of the deal which is subject to M-Systems shareholders approval and Israeli court approval we continue to operate as two separate companies. We’re engaged with M-Systems on planning net divisional organization in combining our respected businesses postpone. In summary, these are exciting times for SanDisk in our industry and we're very pleased with the numerous growth possibilities that we see in our target markets in the fourth quarter and 2007 and beyond. Judy.
Judy Bruner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Thank you Eli and good afternoon everyone. Our total revenue for Q3 was a record $751 million just above the previous record revenue achieved in the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2005. License and royalty revenue of $78 million grew 31% year-over-year and product revenue of $673 million was up 27% year-over-year. Our ASP per megabyte declined 25% sequentially more than we had forecasted due primarily to heavier promotions implemented in response to the competitive pricing environment during the quarter. Megabytes sold increased 40% sequentially more than the 20% to 25% sequential growth we had originally forecasted and compared to 23% sequential growth in the Q3 of last year. Retail revenue was 66% of product revenue in Q3, average capacity for retail products increased 16% sequentially to 882 megabytes and total retail megabytes sold increased 33% sequentially. Within the retail business, the highest sequential growth in megabytes sold and in revenue came from our USB and MP3 products. Looking at the retail business on a year-over-year basis, the strongest growth in megabytes sold and revenue came from our microSD cards for the mobile phone market and our MP3 players. Within the OEM channel, average capacity increased 27% sequentially and megabytes sold increased 59% sequentially. The highest sequential revenue growth came from our iNAND products for the mobile phone market and our 3D memory products for the gaming market. On a year-over-year basis revenue growth was strongest for microSD and Memory Stick PRO Duo cards both for the mobile phone market. On a geographic basis our product revenue mix in Q3 was 46% Americas, 36% Europe, and 18% Asia and Japan, a mix similar to the previous quarter. Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin excluding stock compensation was 32.7% compared to 32.8% in Q2. On a GAAP basis, the Q3 product gross margin was 32.4%, the same as in Q2. Product gross margin was slightly below the range we had forecasted in July due to the higher than expected decline in ASP per megabyte while our strong cost reduction enabled us to maintain a consistent gross margin quarter-to-quarter. Non-captive memory represented less than 10% of our shipments in line with our previous forecasts. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluding stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets were $141 million, up $8 million from Q2 with the largest increase in R&D. GAAP operating expenses were $168 million, up $7 million from Q2. Excluding stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, non-GAAP operating income was $158 million or 21% of revenue within our target financial model of 20% to 24%. Non-GAAP operating income for Q3 was approximately flat to last year's level due to the very benign pricing environment that existed in Q3 of last year while on a year-to-date basis our non-GAAP operating income is up 16% over prior year. We are pleased that our results are within our target financial model range even in a year of aggressive price decline. Other income increased to $32 million due primarily to higher cash balances and higher interest rates. Our tax rate in Q3 remained consistent with Q2 on a non-GAAP basis at 35% while on a GAAP basis our tax rate decreased slightly from 36.5% in Q2 to 35.7% in Q3. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.97 billion in cash short-term and long-term investments, up $286 million from Q2. Q3 cash flow from operations was $291 million, up from $209 million in the comparable quarter last year. We had anticipated a loan or lease guarantee to Flash partners in Q3. However, the need for this cash fell into October. During question we received an 8.5 million repayment of note receivable from FlashVision as the investment in the 200 millimeter fabs is now complete and the FlashVision business venture is now generating cash. We also made an initial investment of $4.3 million in Flash alliance which is the business venture for fab 4. Our fab related outstanding operating lease guarantees for Flash Partners and FlashVision stood at just under $500 million at the end of Q3. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding ended the quarter at 41 days down from 45 days at the end of Q3 reflecting good collections activity. Inventory increased by 18 million sequentially to 396 million in line with business requirements for the fourth quarter and channel inventory ended Q3 at about nine weeks similar to the level at the end of the Q2. I will now turn to our outlook for Q4. Let me remind you that the forward-looking comments I am about to make are subject to risks and uncertainties as described at the beginning of this call and in our periodic SEC filings, and we do not intend to update these comments or forecasts prior to our next quarterly conference call. It is our expectation that the M-Systems acquisition will close before the end of the year. However, since the actual close date is not yet determined at this time, and since purchase accounting is difficult to predict in advance, I will provide our outlook on a SanDisk standalone basis. I will, however, provide some input on how the acquisition may impact results post close. We expect the Q4 sequential decline in ASP per megabyte to be between 15% and 20% due primarily to traditional holiday sales promotions which would bring the annual ASP per megabyte decline for the full-year 2006 compared to 2005 to between 55% and 60%. We are forecasting Q4 sequential growth in megabytes sold to be 50% to 60%. Our Q4 forecast would bring the full-year to an increase in megabytes sold of approximately 200%. This is higher than we expected at the beginning of the year due in large measure to demand elasticity and strong growth in our mobile phone card business. We expect Q4 license and royalty revenue to be in the range of 85 to 90 million based upon estimates derived from recent reports of our licensees. We expect Q4 gross margins to benefit from a higher proportion of product built with our low cost 300 millimeter, 70 nanometer MLC memory, and we expect non-captive supply mix to remain at a level similar to Q3 due primarily to the higher yields and increasing output from Fab 3. Combining this with our forecasted price movement, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 excluding stock compensation to be in the range of 33% to 35%. We expect GAAP product gross margin to be up to one half point lower than the non-GAAP product gross margins. We expect Q4 operating expenses to increase sequentially by approximately 30 to 35 million with the primary drivers being sales and marketing expenses related to holiday sales, 56 nanometer development costs, and legal costs for an ITC hearing in Q4. On the balance sheet, we expect a low level of fab investment in Q4 with Fab 3 expansion being funded primarily through operating leases. We expect approximately 200 million of additional Fab 3 operating leases in Q4 which will be covered by our guarantees. I will now turn to the impact of the M-Systems acquisition. We will record the results of M-Systems operations within SanDisk from the closing date forward. In addition to combining operating results, the purchase accounting for the transaction will impact revenue gross margin and expenses. On the revenue and margin side, any M-Systems deferred revenue existing at closing date does not get recognized. As a result there will be some one-time loss of revenue. Also purchase accounting requires recording of assets at fair market value. This means that we will write up M-Systems finished goods inventory at the time of the close to the expected sales price less selling costs which will reduce the gross margin when those finished goods are actually sold. Depending on when the transaction closes and the amount of deferred revenue and finished goods inventory at that time, these accounting requirements will impact the closed quarter and possibly the subsequent quarter. On the expense side there are several factors to keep in mind. In the quarter in which the deal closes, there will be a one-time charge for the value of in-process R&D, and there will be ongoing charges to the P&L for the amortization of intangible assets identified and valued in the purchased accounting. We also expect some limited restructuring charges originating from both companies as we determine how best to merge the businesses and infrastructures. The restructuring charges on the M-Systems side will become part of the purchased accounting and as a result are not expected to impact the P&L. The restructuring charges on the SanDisk side are not part of purchased accounting and instead will be recorded as expense in the quarter or quarters in which firm plans are established. Assuming the transaction closes in Q4, I will provide detail on these items in our January earnings call which given the complexities of the transaction is likely to be around the end of January, a few days later than in the past. In terms of the operating income, the operating impact of the M-Systems acquisition, excluding the impact of one-time charges and purchased accounting, we expect the transaction to be slightly dilutive in the early quarters but to be accretive on a cash or a non-GAAP basis by the end of year one as we are able to utilize some of our expanding captive supply to meet M-Systems demand and as we are able to derive revenue synergies particularly in the handset market. In summary, we are very focused on delivering a successful Q4 and on carefully planning and managing the expected SanDisk M-Systems close and subsequent integration. We'll now open the call for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Congratulations on a very solid quarter. With respect to pro forma operating or guess non-GAAP operating expenses, wanted to do a little housekeeping. It looks like you had about 22 million change that was pro forma out. I was wondering how you split that between R&D and SG&A?
Judy Bruner: Sure, Daniel. There was actually about 25 million of stock compensation expense in the P&L, and let me give you a breakdown of that. There is 2.6 million in cost of sales. There is 10.3 million in R&D, 4.6 million in sales and marketing, and 7.7 million in G&A. And then the other GAAP to non-GAAP item is a line item that you see for amortization of intangible assets.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Okay. Thank you on that. And then with regard you made mention of two to four X declines in NAND pricing to get the laptop market or to get the PC markets going with NAND. I was wondering, is there a dollar amount per gigabyte that you would say is a specific point to get there, obviously 2 to 4X is a very wide range.
Eli Harari: Daniel, I think that we've fully expect that solid state disk in other hybrid Flash devices following Flash will start showing up in the market in 2007, certainly with early adoptions, but at the current price of, like – about $0.02 per megabyte, 32 gigabyte drive even at the OEM level is still way too expensive except for early adopters. So, however, this market, it is not just a one- -- a kind of a step function. We continuously expect to see technology allowing us to bring the costs down, and that will allow this market to become the Flash solution to become more attractive. I would expect that by 2008 if you look at just historic cost and price reductions that we've seen over the last five years, extrapolate that on the next two years, 2008 this will become a more significant market and by 2009, 2010, I think it will become a very, very large market, at least that's what some marketing organizations are projecting, and I personally agree with them, but it won't happen except through -- I mean Flash really has got to come down in price.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon guys thanks so much. Just a couple of questions on the supply demand. I guess first, do you have any thoughts about some of the third parties that have come out and suggest that there could be some pretty significant excess capacity next year? I think the numbers that maybe an I-supply or someone like that saying maybe 160% demand bit growth, 200% supply bit growth. What are your thoughts on that as it stands today?
Eli Harari: You know, this market is proving to be quite adaptive in fact to the demand side, and we've seen Samsung just announced two days ago in the quarterly results that they're going to -- they're projecting a 120% megabyte increase for them next year, and that is -- and 140% increase in supply industry wide. We think that the demand next year from the new markets and existing markets will be higher than that and frankly, 120% is for additional supplies from Samsung appears relatively low, I think it would be surprised that low. The adaptive part of the market is as you know, NAND with the 60% price decline over the last year or so has become less profitable substantially so than DRAM. DRAM pricing has been going up, and it is no question that DRAM wafer today generates substantially more growth margin dollars to the DRAM manufacturers that also in NAND Flash particularly if they are behind the technology curve in NAND Flash or have not yet adopted MLC to be profitable in NAND you really have to be in 200 millimeters today and you have to be on leading edge technology with MLC and high volume production. So, I think that the sub corrective nature of this business is if the prices will drop too fast, people will not add new capacity, and that will reduce the price decline. In general, and I have said that many times in the past, pricing for NAND in the annual 40% to 45%, maybe 50% price decline very healthy for the creation of new markets and I would say certainly in the 40% range sustainable from the point of view of technology migrations. 60% is not sustainable long-term. You cannot have 60% price reductions every year. Let's say we've had 52% last year, I think this year is more like between 55% and 60%. I think that next year I would not be surprised if the demand supply is better because of reduced supply and increased demand. I am actually modestly optimistic about next year.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Can I ask -- just one quick follow-up on the reduced supply relative to this year. I mean isn’t Samsung's CapEx plans, that's going to impact the latter part of 2007, but we head into 2007 with some pretty significant excess or at least not anywhere near as tight as we were last year, and I guess the question is what do you make of the fact that this time last year with the new products for the seasonal period we were in a significantly tighter supply demand situation and that kind of carried through the first part of this year that we are right now, and thanks very much.
Eli Harari: Yeah. It’s a very complex multi-faceted situation, for example, the adoption rate of MLC by everyone of supply has a lot of bearing on the eventual total supply. You know, some of the new players that were supposed to be, pretty significant attributive to capacity in 2006 and certainly in 2007 are having a lot more difficult time competing this market. You just so, what, last week Saifun announced that Qimonda is backing out of this NROM, and that's because of both the pricing situation that makes it less attracted active for them to enter and the technology difficulties that they would be having very similar to what AGN had two years ago for in essence. So, it’s very, very difficult. I have characterized NAND and particularly NAND MLC as a bullet train, and if you're not operating at the leading edge, if you're not sitting in the -- you know, driving the train up front, you're going to be -- you may make decisions to not invest -- you would think a lot harder before you invest in major new NAND capacity.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Judy, this is a question for you in terms of royalty. Can you walk us through how there seems to be some upside, where is this upside coming from, is this mainly from MLC or is this more of a quad royalty uptick that you're having?
Judy Bruner: The increase -- I presume you're referring to the increase in royalty revenue from Q3 to our Q4 forecast. Does that right?
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: No, from Q3 to Q4 and also Q4 to Q3, please. Basically you guided, what, 67, right, and you did $78 million in Q3, and so there is some upside. So I am just trying to understand where the upside is coming from?
Judy Bruner: So actually we had guided back in July, I believe, to a decrease in royalty revenue of 10 to $12 million from the first quarter which I believe would have worked out to something like 70 to $72 million in royalties, and we achieved $78 million.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Right.
Judy Bruner: So there was something like 6 to $8 million of upside, and you know, let me remind that you when we give this guidance we do not have any precise reporting from our licensees on these numbers, so these are estimates that we're putting together based upon various forecasts data and various public statements that we've heard these licensees say, so I am not going to take you through the specific details, but as you know, the royalty revenue -- the royalty rate is applied to revenue of our licensees, so if our licensees either sell more bits or price differently than we were forecasting, or have a different mix as you referred to of SLC versus MLC, all those factor into the number.
Eli Harari: I would like to say, make another point on the royalties which actually is today relatively small factor, but nonetheless, I think is one that is perhaps you guys are not really maybe focused on, and that is that as SD particularly miniSD and microSD – microSD particularly, as that market grows in volume, you know, SD has -- microSD essentially has not become the (indiscernible) for handsets, and we fully expect volume in microSD cards to take off very, very significantly over the next several years, and we do expect that our co-ownership of the SD, miniSD and microSD card standards through 3C, Toshiba and SanDisk to begin to reflect some increased contribution from royalties that we expect to be collecting from those cards. As I said today it’s still relatively small number, but when you're looking at the kind of projections for handsets that have card slots, that overtime could grow and become a nice contributor.
Judy Bruner: Actually I will add on one point to that to the question you asked, Satya. There was a bit of upside in the Q2 royalty revenue on the card side but it primarily came from royalties on chips.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: On chips. Okay. On the royalty subject, sounds like Samsung is increasing dramatically from 40% to 75% in Q4. What are your thoughts, and it’s all that royalty will start coming into Q1. Is that right, Judy? The MLC contribution from Samsung?
Judy Bruner: As we've said in the past, there is a higher royalty rate that we derive on sales of MLC, NAND versus SLC NAND, and so, yes, that bodes well for 2007, but keep in mind that we've seen a fair amount of variation in the past between the projected MLC mix from our licensees and the actual MLC mix that has occurred.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay. Great. One question for Eli. Eli, on the cell phone which is in 2007 with the number of models you're talking about and so on, what are the metrics that make you a little more optimistic the retail versus OEM last two quarters you talked about retail uptick being 15% of the entire mix. Any other metrics you can talk about how are they shaking out at this point for Q3 and Q4?
Eli Harari: Yes. Let me give you, Satya, one metric that I saw today that really is really very encouraging, and that is the number -- this is a market that I will get the number. The name of the marketing -- they're projecting the number of cell phones sold in the fourth quarter, this quarter, that music enabled will be 90 million actual handsets that are music enabled, and let me remind you they're enabled through Flash memory. Because if you don't have 5 megabyte minimum, you don't really have music, and the number from next year that they're projecting is that fully 51% of all handsets, that is 550 million handsets will be music enabled, enabled either through embedded Flash which something like the iNAND or the mDOC from M-Systems or through mobile cards, so even this quarter 90 million units compared to, -- 8.7 million iPods sold in the third quarter. This is a 10 X large number, and this is why we're so excited about that. And as far as your question about retail and OEM, it’s still early for retail, but it is growing, and I expect it will become a substantial portion eventually I would say within the next eighteen months or so could well become the dominant part of the sales. It sure feels like I could tell you like the heady days of the digital camera market when that really started moving from just a bundle to very strong retail after-market sales, and I would say that for the fourth quarter we are scrambling -- we're really scrambling to meet the demand particularly for microSD, mostly for backend assembly and test capacity, mostly assembly capacity.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay, Great.
Eli Harari: So the signs are very positive for -- in that regard for Q4 and for next year.
Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. 
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Yeah, good afternoon. I have a couple of quick questions. Eli, as you look at the downward sloping cost curve for the NAND industry in aggregate, how smooth is it now and if there are going to be any sort of step function reductions, when will they takes place and for what reasons?
Eli Harari: Good question, Paul. The industry -- these price reductions that we saw over this past several quarters clearly have been faster than anybody would expect including myself, ourselves, and are beginning to -- I believe are not sustainable as I said before until frankly the next major cost reduction has got to come with the next generation technology, and that technology applied at MLC which we've said is around middle of next year, so to the extent that there is aggressive price reductions in the first half of the year, they will -- it become more difficult to bring the cost down until the next generation comes in. We've said that we are -- we expect to start production of the 56 nanometer in the first quarter next year, but the full positive impact will start showing up until the significantly lower cost hopefully that is we don't know the yield of costs in the third quarter of next year. We think that our cost structure is as good as anybody out there. Samsung has said that they planned to introduce the 51 nanometer technology I think in the second quarter next year. So unless you are operating at that node it’s going to be very difficult for other competitors to drive pricing down from where they are today, but as we know, sometimes prices are not driven by cost but rather by other considerations.
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, my second question really relates to the channel fill that's happening at the moment. Sounds like you're going from approximately 200,000 outlets to considerably more over the next year or so. As that channel fills out, what kind of product is going into it?
Eli Harari: Maybe Sanjay can comment. Sanjay just came back from India. We have a major effort in new geographies -- go ahead.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Basically our retail sales organization is very much focused on increasing the store fronts globally and yes we are around 200,000 now and over longer term over the next three to four years time frame we expect to increase that dramatically toward our goal of about 400,000 stores or so, and basically through the detailed handheld and through all those stores we plan to sell our full lineup of products, the mobile cards, the imaging cards as well as USB flashlight and the complete line of products.
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Can you say anything about the margin of that product lineup? Is it going to align with the corporate average or will it be lower?
Sanjay Mehrotra: You know, we certainly expect the margin to align with corporate targets that we have for the gross margins even as we expand in other regions. We are very much focused on cost reductions and cost reductions achieved through technology transitions as well as manufacturing efficiencies, so we would expect the overall gross margin alignment to remain similar to what we have experienced in the past.
Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht.
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Thanks a lot and congratulations on a good quarter.
Eli Harari: Thank you. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: A couple questions. First of all, can you comment a bit on two things related to handset, first the number of units shipped? You made your comment on past couple of quarters of microSD units, and second can you maybe give your best estimate kind of what the attach rate right now between a phone and a card and where it’s going into in '07?
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of the number of cards shipped into the mobile, about 16 million units cards shipped into the mobile space, and in terms of the attached rate, at this point especially it include both the OEM and the retail, the attach rate I believe is somewhere in the range of about 20%, but you would look at having this attach rate go higher.
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: This is both bundled and unbundled? 
Eli Harari: Yes, bundled and unbundled. The majority is still bundled, and the first question was what format, the majority now is microSD, the second largest format is the Memory Stick Pro Duo for the Sony Erickson, we point out that Sony Erickson is 10% -- our 10% customer in the third quarter.
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Okay. Thanks. One other question, can you give a litigation update? You commented that you have some expense related to the ITC hearings, where is that standing, what's kind of the time schedule there?
Judy Bruner: We have a scheduled court date in the month of December of this year at the ITC, and this is with regard to the suits that we've brought against STMicro.
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: And the expense? 
Judy Bruner: You know, we haven't given the specific amount of expense. But it will cost some increase in G&A in the fourth quarter, and it’s included within the 30 to 35. I actually talked about the expense increase in order of size, so the biggest increase in expenses in the fourth quarter will come from sales and marketing expenses related to the holiday selling season, next biggest increase will come from 56 nanometer development, and then there will be some increase in expense in G&A primarily related to legal.
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns.
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: My first question on cost reductions, what is the sweet spot for your current cost reduction in terms of 12 inch RAM and the 70 nanometer transition? Is it Q4 or do you think you will see significant cost reduction from Q4 into Q1 also?
Eli Harari: You know, we are continue to go ramp Fab 3 at the more or less the linear pace. We expect to reach by the middle of next year I think we said 110,000 wafers a month, and the yields have reached very high level. We're very pleased with the yield, so there is not a lot of upside on the yield side. There is some upside on volume. The volume will increase -- will continue to increase substantially absorbing the fixed costs of those fab.
Judy Bruner: Let me just add to that, Gurinder. Keep in mind that we just completed the transition to 70 nanometer in Q3 from a production perspective, and so from a revenue perspective it takes one to two quarters before that production is actually built into products, shipped, and recognized as revenue, so there will be clearly some benefit of the 70 nanometer transition that will be impacting Q4 revenue, and we've taken that into account in the guidance that we gave for the 33% to 35% gross margin.
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: And my second question in terms of seasonality, is your seasonality changing a bit given that the OEM business now is such a big portion of your revenues, I mean normal seasonality obviously strongest in Q4, second strongest in Q2. Is seasonality changing between how you use Q1, Q2 and Q3 given the OEM proportion of your revenues?
Judy Bruner: I would say perhaps it moderates it a little bit. But if you think about, the sale of mobile phones and cards for mobile phones are actually do very well in the holiday selling season as well, so and in fact the handset manufacturers, you know, are very focused on taking delivery of the cards on a bundled basis on adjust-in-time basis as well, so there is definitely for example strong demand that we're seeing now in the fourth quarter for cards for mobile phones.
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: But the OEM business and the handset business, do you think that could make the seasonality in Q1 less pronounced given the linear effect?
Judy Bruner: I think you'll still see very traditional seasonality from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our business.
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Thanks.
Judy Bruner: Thank you. If I could ask the next caller to limit their questions to one or two, please.
Eli Harari: Let me just -- the source for that number of cellphones, 19 million in Q4, and 550 million next year is strategy related and that is their latest report.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Gauna with UBS.
Steven Chen – UBS: This is Steven Chen calling behalf of Alex. My question is in regards to handsets form factor cards. Just would you give us more color on the competition that you're seeing in that space for OEM bundled products from other branded cards and also what kind much ESP pressures do you see in that space given that you're probably dealing more directly with wireless service providers rather than a retail source? 
Eli Harari: As I said before, the dominant phone factor has now become microSD both in terms of handset models that supported but also it is almost a wholesale adoption now of microSD. There is motorola ofcourse started that with the thin phones that were enabled by the microSD, but now, you know, Nokia has basically endorsed it wholeheartedly. There is not a single handset guide that is not -- just about any handset guide that has plans for a mobile card slot either goes to microSD or to Sony Erickson equivalent which is M2, MMC -- Memory Stick Duo micro which we're developing together with Sony. The clear, if your SD is basically falling out, MMC is falling out, MMC micro is falling out, compared to 49% for microSD, MMC micro is 1% of the new handsets. It is just -- now, as far as the new players, you know, we've standardized microSD through the SD association, and we do see other suppliers coming into the market. We expect to see competition that's the name of the game, but frankly at this stage, with the very rapid growth I believe everybody is scrambling to go on if you will the back end assembly capacity that's out there. We saw it coming a lot earlier and we are in better shape I think that most other people, but we, too, are scrambling. 
Eli Harari: The second piece of your question relative to pricing, the price movement within our OEM channel was very similar to the price movement within the retail channel in this quarter. And typically over time that's going to be the case. You're not going to have big divergence of price movement between those two channels over time. 
 Steven Chen – UBS: Okay. And lastly, when would you expect to see some royalty revenues that is derived from your microSD from TransFlash?
Eli Harari: We're seeing that as I said, but the numbers are still relatively small, and of course these are royalty says that are shared between ourselves and Matsushita and Toshiba.
 Steven Chen – UBS: And last question I have this for Judy, Judy could you provide us your CapEx spending for Q3 and if you could also an estimate for Q4? 
Judy Bruner: Okay, so you can actually see the CapEx spending for Q3 on the cash flow statement that's attached to our press release, and you can see it was about $34 million of non-fab related CapEx spending for the third quarter. Are you asking about fab or non-fab? 
 Steven Chen – UBS: For everything.
Judy Bruner: Okay. For the third quarter is about 34 million for non-fab and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we made very little in the way of fab cash investment in the third quarter. We invested 4 million in Flash alliance for fab 4. Dialing forward to the fourth quarter, on the fab side we expect about $200 million of investment in fab 3, but we expected to come primarily from guarantee of operating leases as I have said a couple of times in the past, as long as we can get attractive operating leases at very low rates, we are prioritizing that type of funding for the fab. And then in terms of non-fab related CapEx I would expect at the beginning of the year I gave a forecast of about 200 million for the year, and I would say we're at about 125 million so far year-to-date and I think Q4 we'll see higher CapEx spending than we did in Q3. I think we will begin to -- we may not reach the 200 million, but we'll get a good way towards that number in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christian Garo (ph) with Robert Baird. 
Christian Garo - Robert Baird: Your long-term model for captive, non-captive mix is 70/30%. Given that your guidance for the non-captive mix to be less than 10% of -- less than 10% in Q4 which is seasonally the strongest quarter, what could we expect in the first half of next year and specifically could we run of risk of you getting to a 100% captive model and then potentially some other capacity, and I guess the leading question to that is how long are the supply contracts and system has to abide to? 
 Eli Harari : M-System.
Judy Bruner: You know, let me start. First, let me say we still believe over the long-term the right strategic model for our business is a 70/30 mix, 70% captive, 30% non-captive, and it is too early at this point for us to give any specific guidance for 2007 or the first half of 2007, but as you described, we will have the M-systems business combining with our business fairly soon now, so I think that significantly decreases the type of risk you were suggesting from over supply. Of course M-systems has some clearly has some commitments to current suppliers, and that will put some limitation on our ability to utilize our growing non-captive supply in that business, but we fully intend to work to be able to utilize some of our captive supply within the M-systems business as fast as we can. That's one of the key synergies that we expect to gain out of this transaction over the coming quarters. That's part of what we expect will lead to the deal being accretive by the end of year one as well as revenue synergies that we expect to gain. 
Christian Garo - Robert Baird: Great. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Citigroup. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thank you. Just starting with a clarification. You mentioned competitive pricing. Could you just provide some context around when in the quarter you started to see things being more competitive than you thought they would be when you gave your initial guidance and was that in a particular product line or particular geography? 
Eli Harari: I think my saying was fairly competitive throughout the course of the quarter. So these promotion that we implemented to really match and maintain our position was pretty much throughout the course of the quarter. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay.
Judy Bruner : When you ask that, as we saw the quarter unfold, demand was in line with our expectations if not somewhat stronger than our expectations in the summer months. It really was -- there was a bigger gap than we like to see between our pricing and the competitive pricing and so that's what caused us to make a move to implement higher pricing actions primarily in the form of promotions than we had anticipated when we gave guidance in July. 
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: That was across all products, all retail products, Judy. 
Judy Bruner: For the most part, yes.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Okay. And then prospectively, you recently had the announcement with Best Buy and Circuit City, how should we think about MP3 market share as we look towards the fourth quarter into next year and how we think about the potential for other similar such agreements that broaden out your partnership profile on the MP3 side of the business? 
Eli Harari: I will say New York when we launched supported Best Buy and launching that program. They're very, very serious about the digital music store. We've been working roughly to optimize the something 200 to be seamless. The fourth quarter we're going to have a number of models that span entire price range and we are launching pretty aggressively MP3 players in Europe and the Pac Rim. So fourth quarter we're looking as you know the MP3 market is very, very much centered on the fourth quarter and we are pretty optimistic. We expect to do well, certainly looks very good. 
Operator: And due to time constraints, we have time for one final question. It comes from Eric Gomberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on technology developments where you stand in the migration to smaller geometries and higher capacities in the one-time programmable as well as where things might be in 3 bit per cell or X 4 or making 3D rewritable. 
Eli Harari: Okay on 3D we are -- we plan to move by about a middle of next year I would say third quarter next year in production to the next technology node which is still lagging going from .13 micron to 80-nanometer, but it is a very important step to get their costs down. 3 bit and 4 bit per cell, 4 bit is of course X 4 and emphasis has been working on for the last four years or so will have to see how we can do, what comes support we can throw in to accelerate that, but both the 3 bit and 4 bit although quite challenging, we think overall that we have a good shot at commercializing but it probably will not make substantial impact on our cost structure or output until late 2007 at the earliest.
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay.
Eli Harari: So I think we really have to close here although we are really having enjoying ourselves, so in closing first of all I would like to congratulate us all for Wall Street hitting the 12,000 mark today. It is really great. I wish and you your family a happy holiday season. Also, I want to say that I will be planning a vacation in January, so I won't be here. I will be in the Southern Hampshire and Sanjay will join Jude to discuss Q4 results. But these are good exciting times for all of us and thank you very much.

Listeners are cautioned not to place undo reliance on those forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Eli Harari. 
Eli Harari : Thank you Laurie. I will direct my remarks first to our second quarter results and then focus mostly on our outlook for the second half. The second quarter was the best ever for OEM sales and the second best for retail, with record units and megabytes sold. The star of the quarter continued to be our growing mobile card business in handsets where we saw not only strong bundling activity with all the major handset OEMs but also continuing traction in the mobile retail after market. So we now sell our cards through approximately 64,000 storefronts. In the U.S., as well as in Europe, we have developed excellent partnerships with most of the large mobile network operators who sell our cards with their music and camera enable handsets. A number of handset models with card slots continues to grow steadily and reached 494 in the second quarter. We believe that this market is still in its early stages and are excited by its future growth potential for us in the coming years. According to NPD, Independent Market Data, our mobile cards commanded 96% of market share in U.S. retail in June.  Retail sales were also aided by solid sales of cards for digital cameras where out SanDisk Ultra and SanDisk Extreme product lines are gaining wide popularity with consumers and professional photographers. Last week we introduced our Extreme IV Cards, which add up to 40 megabytes per second y trade are by far are the world's fastest flash card. This announcement was made together with several of the leading professional digital camera makers including Hasselblad, Nikon and Life, which challenged us engineers to meet heretofore unheard of redirect performance flash storage. This is an important milestone for flash because at these performance levels flash begins to compete favorably on performance with competing disk drives.  Sales of our Sansa line of MP3 players grew nicely in the quarter coming from early from U.S. retail where our unit share for U.S. retail flash players grew to 15% in June according NPD data. We are very encouraged by the level of interest and support we are receiving from the major retailers in the U.S. and Canada who appreciate the exciting design of the Sansa E200 and the strong value proposition that our expending Sansa line up offers to consumers.  Microsoft's recent announcement of their intent to enter the audio player market is another indication of the growing importance of this consumer appliance. Based on what they have publicly said we believe that Microsoft will mimic Apple's proprietary closed system solution, which will provide us the opportunity to continue to clearly differentiate our Sansa platform as the open system alternative and deliver the best value proposition, particularly at the $50 to $150 segment of the audio player market.  The partnerships that we're developing with the various music services will become more visible in the coming quarters and will further enhance the Sansa user experience.  In the second half we expect to significantly expand our presence in audio players in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.  On the operations side this was a very good quarter for continuing to run Prop3 with the stars who are currently executing the 300-mm. transitions to 70 mm. 8 gigabyte MLC. We expect the transition to 70-mm. on 300 mm. wafers to be essentially completed by the end of this quarter, which means that we will be out of the 90 meter on both 200 mm. and 300 mm. wafers. These developments should provide us with accompanying output that carries an attractive co-structure for the substantial Prop3 capacity coming out stream in the second half. This wrapping of captive capacity will likely reduce, at least temporarily, our reliance on non-captive supply although we expect our future sourcing to continue to have a non-captive portion within the flexible supply model that we have relied upon in the past. Turning now to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect the demand and supply should come into balance during the current quarter as we head into the fall. Our third quarter is typically back end loaded with back-to-school sales. In the fourth quarter we expect a traditionally strong holiday sales to drive demand, particularly from the two major growth engines, handset and Flash Audio Players. Flash is becoming ever more pervasive in new markets and even to more mature markets such as digital cameras. I expect it to show a robust demand during the holiday season.  Price elasticity following the dramatically lower pricing this year is expected to drive consumer preference to gigabyte capacities in the second half.  The Flash audio player market by itself is projected to consume perhaps as much as 25% of the total industry output of non-flash in the last four months of this calendar year. This represents a very large increase in Flash demand compared to the first half of the year and it is likely to have a strong positive impact on the demand side of the equation.  Demand for Flash in handsets, be it the flash side in cards will likewise continue to consume significant portions of the available Flash supply.  Industry wide supply will continue to ramp in the second half, including our own ramp. However, the cumulative steep price reductions for NAND over the first half are making allocation of whoever starts to NAND less attractive for the manufacturers. To be profitable in NAND you need to be in high volume production right at the leading edge. To date the new players in NAND have not caught up with the 70-mm. MLC technology note of the market leaders. Judy will provide guidance on our third quarter pricing. Our objective with these price moves is to continue to stimulate new demand, expand the total pie, and create new markets through continuously delivering greater value to our customers.  In summary, we are bullish about our business prospects and we'll continue to focus on innovation and growth in the years ahead. Thank you for continuing your support. Judy.
Judy Bruner : Thank you Eli and good afternoon everyone. Before discussing our results I'd like to point out that we have changed the presentation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results in our press release financial statements to provide only GAAP results on the income statement followed by a separate page of reconciliations to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful in accessing our performance, allocating resources, and planning for the future, as well as in providing consistency with prior financial reporting and comparing our results to those of other companies.  Our second quarter product revenue was up 40% year-over-year and up 18% sequentially. Megabytes sold increased 46% sequentially, slightly above the 35-45% range we predicted in April. An ASP per megabyte declined 19% in line with our previous guidance. We were pleased with retail sell through, particularly in the month of June. Retail revenue was 70% of product revenue for Q2 increasing 20% sequentially. Average capacity for retail products increased 15% sequentially to 758 megabytes with the fastest growing retail capacity coming in Micro SD Mobile Cards and Blue Label SD Camera Cards. Our OEM revenue increased a solid 15% sequentially to a record level of $191 million. OEM sales growth was dominated by micro SD cards for the mobile handset market followed by strong sales of the memory stick Pro Duro card, also for the mobile market. Average capacity of OEM cards increased 24% sequentially driven by increased capacity of bundled micro SD mobile cards. Our license and royalty revenue of $82.5 million was slightly above the range we had predicted in April.  On a geographic basis our product revenue mix in Q2 was 45% Americas, 34% Europe and 21% Asia and Japan. The sequential shift of two points towards the Americas was primarily due to strong Americas' retail business.  GAAP product gross margin in Q2 of 32.4% was higher than we had expected for several reasons. First, with retail sell through at the high-end of our expectations we recognized more low cost fab 3 production in cost of sales than we had forecasted. Second, in addition, strong fab 3 output led to Q2 non-captive purchases of less than 10% and products produced with non-captive memory represented less than 15% of our megabyte shipments during Q2 compared to 32% in Q1. And third, the cost of the plant shut down of fab 3 for a power upgrade in April was more than offset by strong yields and reduced cost per bit.  Non-GAAP product gross margin, excluding stock compensation, was 32.8% for Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding stock compensation and acquisition related charges were $133 million, up $14 million from Q1 with the largest increase coming from investment in R and D. Excluding stock compensation and acquisition related charges our non-GAAP income of $159 million, or 22% of revenue, was up 50% in dollars on a year-over-year basis. Other income increased to $22 million due primarily to our higher cash balances and rising interest rates.  Our tax rate in Q2 remained consistent with Q1 on a non-GAAP basis at 35% while on a GAAP basis our tax rates decreased from 54% in Q1 to 36.5% in Q2 due to the nondeductible in process R and D charge in Q1 and variations caused by the impact of stock compensation expense.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. You will note that $406 million of our cash investments have been reclassified to long-term based upon their purchase to maturity date.  Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $59 million. Cash flow from employee stock programs and related tax benefits was $42 million and net proceeds from our convertible offerings was $1.05 billion. Investing activities including a Flash Partners lull of $95 million and a Flash Partners investment of $84 million for a total Q2 cash contribution to Flash Partners of $180 million. We also guaranteed an incremental $140 million of operating leases for Flash Partners bringing our total stab related operating lease guarantees for Flash Partners and Flash Vision to approximately $540 million. Accounts Receivable increased $66 million reflecting higher Q2 shipments and DSO stands at 45 days, a typical level for Q2. Inventory decreased $35 million to $378 million or 80 days of inventory down from 98 days at the end of last quarter. Channel inventory at the end of Q2 was approximately nine weeks down from approximately 10.5 weeks at the end of Q1. We believe both balance sheet inventory and channel inventory are at comfortable levels for our business model.  I'll now turn to our outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year. Let me remind you that the forward-looking comments I am about to make are subject to risk and uncertainties as described at the beginning of this call and in our periodic SEC filings; and we do not intend to update these comments or forecast prior to our next quarterly conference call.  We have locked in lower pricing for our OEM customers for Q3 and we have already implemented certain retail price reductions in all regions in July. We will implement back-to-school promotions later in the quarter and selective additional retail price reductions are possible. Overall, we expect the Q3 sequential decline in ASP per megabyte to be similar to the decline in Q2. For the year, we now expect the 2006 average ASP per megabyte to decline approximately 55% from the average price per megabyte in 2005. Still in the range we gave at the start of the year but at the higher end. In Q3 we expect average capacities to continue to grow nicely based on the cumulative price reductions of this year while we expect unit growth to follow a seasonal pattern of slower growth in the third quarter than in the second quarter.  These two factors lead us to expect Q3 megabytes sold to increase sequentially by approximately 20 to 25%. For the full year of 2006 we continue to expect megabytes sold to increase between 180 and 190% over 2005. We expect Q3 license and royalty revenue to be in the range of $68 to $72 million based upon estimates that we have derived from recent Q2 reports of our licensees. We now expect total license and royalty revenue for 2006 to be closer to approximately $325 million rather than the $350 million we estimated at the beginning of the year.  In terms of gross margins for Q3 we expect cost reduction to be greater than we experienced in Q2 as we will have a higher proportion of our supply mix coming from 70-nanometer 300-mm wafers; and we expect our non-captive supply mix to remain at a level similar to, or lower than, Q2. Combining this with our forecasted price movement we expect non-GAAP product gross margin for Q3, excluding stock compensation, to be in the range of 33 to 35%, up from the comparable 32.8% in Q2. On a GAAP basis we expect product gross margin to be approximately one half point lower than on a non-GAAP basis.  We expect Q3 operating expenses to increase by approximately $10 million from Q2 based primarily on increased sales and marketing as well as R and D expenses; and we expect our tax rate to remain consistent.  Inventory levels are expected to increase during Q3 in preparation for the seasonally strong Q4. For Fab 3 expansion we expect to provide approximately $200 million either in the form of a cash loan to Flash Partners or in the form of an operating lease guarantee, or some combination of the two.  In summary, we are very pleased with Q2's year-over-year revenue growth of 40% as well as the GAAP operating margin of 18% and the non-GAAP operating margin of 22% and we are optimistic about results in the second half of the year. We will now open the call for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll pause for a moment to assemble our queue. We'll take our first question from Paul Coster with JP Morgan.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Yeah, I have a couple of quick questions. The first one is licensing, slightly short of your prior expectations and we're wondering where the weakness is coming. Is it by any chance in MLC at the sort of higher end of the food chain? The second question is are there any consequences to you reducing the non-captive consumption, particularly from Samsung?
Judy Bruner : Paul, I'll take that. You know, the primary reason for reducing our expectations for the year on license and royalty revenue was based on the results we heard from one of our key licensees for their second quarter, which translates into our third quarter and in that case the licensee experienced quite aggressive price decline in the second quarter without enough offsetting bit growth to offset and to the point you mentioned the percent of the MLC mix was down slightly from their Q1 to their Q2. We do expect the MLC mix to continue to grow but we've dialed back our estimates for Q3 based on what we heard about Q2 and then Q4 flowing from that.
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Okay. Then on the…
Eli Harari : As far as the consequences Paul, no, there are no consequences for reducing, for the time being, our non-captive purchases model. That's precisely what the model is about. It gives us flexibility that we need to have and I don't see any consequences. 
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Okay. One final question Eli. You said that the Flash audio players would be a greater percentage of sales in the second half. Can you approximate what they may have been in the first half of this year? 
Eli Harari : The first half -- I've heard a number that retail sales of audio players in the fourth quarter account for about 60% of the total annual unit and probably megabyte sales. So I'm basing it on -- really on that basic assumption. We certainly have seen in the last fourth quarter, you know, a huge spike and I would expect that. So I would not be surprised -- I don't have the actual numbers but I would not be surprised if the second half of the year represents, you know, at least 60% of the total output, compared to 40%; maybe 65/35. One third, two-thirds would be a reasonable number. 
Paul Coster – JP Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Eli Harari : I'm talking about -- this is for the industry as a whole. I'm not talking about ourselves.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll move to Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht.
Daniel Amir – WR Hambrecht : Thanks a lot and congratulations on a good quarter. I have a couple of questions. First can you comment a bit about your USB business as it goes to U-3 as well? It seems like in your press release or in your prepared comments you haven't commented much on that. Kind of how good was that segment in Q2 and kind of what are you looking at and for the second half of the year what can we expect?
Eli Harari : The USB market was relatively flat for us in the second quarter, a little bit down; and I would say we lost a little bit of market share. The USB in general has been very, very price competitive but we do expect that with introduction of more U3 platforms that this will reverse itself and also by the way USB Flashback, I believe, had the highest average capacity per unit, which is very good. So it's true that we, you know, we can do better in USB, particularly outside the United States and we will do better. This is -- we are certainly setting our sites on improving the market share and particularly outside of the United States.
Daniel Amir – WRI Hambrecht : As it relates to that, I mean continued having all this additional capacity from Fab 3. I mean are you just focused more on other markets? I mean is that the strategy specifically in the handset business or…
Eli Harari : No. No, absolutely not. USB and U3 in particular represents a very attractive market because we do believe that the capacity, capacity demands, from that application are somewhat open-ended, I mean insatiable drive to more and more capacity and eventually making significant in roads into the computing environment. So we remain very committed to this market and we are certainly not going to shy away from using -- applying our capacity as it comes on stream to gain market share and improve our sales. 
Daniel Amir – WRI Hambrecht : Okay, and one final question. On your handset business, I mean last quarter you commented what percent of revenues it was. Can you tell us what it was here in Q2? 
Eli Harari : I think we said about 30% of our revenues, product revenues…
Judy Bruner : Of our product revenues, yes. 
Eli Harari : Last quarter I think it was slightly above that and you know the market has grown as a whole. So we think we're moving the right direction. 
Daniel Amir – WRI Hambrecht : Okay, thank you.
Eli Harari : Not we think. We're pretty confident we are moving in the right direction.
Daniel Amir – WRI Hambrecht : Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners.
 Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners :  Hi, guys, nice quarter.
Judy Bruner:  Thanks, Eric.
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: I was hoping that you could give an update on what's going on in terms of your technology development and what you see competitively, specifically talking about, your -- the Matrix acquisition and the opportunities with that technology as well as what you see externally, including M systems, X4 technology.
Eli Harari:  Yes. So technology is moving really along I would say three fronts. First of all, we are now solidly in 300 millimeter, 70 nanometer MLC 2 bit for sale. So we've crossed that bridge and I'm very pleased that we are where we are; very well positioned for the second half in terms of costs and capacity.  So the next major cost reduction hurdle, if you will, or challenge for us is to obsolete the 70 nanometer as quickly as we can with what we call a 56 nanometer and we expect that to start in the first quarter next year and we expect to be probably where we are today with 70 nanometer, in 56 nanometer by the same time next year. So it will start hopefully early in next year. In the second half next year that should become our next major production workhorse. Matrix is doing very well with the integration and moving on to the next technology node, which is now under development. What we have done with Matrix is we've asked them to recruit additional engineering bandwidth as quickly as they can. And that's what they have been doing. The key is to move to a parallel development approach where they do not just focus on one generation at a time, we are moving to two of the next generation nodes.  So you will see the next generation technology coming into production in the second half of next year and then hopefully in 2008, the generation after that. By that time, they should be caught up with the technology lithography nodes and they will have all the benefits of the four levels.  This is still one-time programmable and we are definitely aggressively pursuing finding a way to drive to rewritable, but nothing new to report there. On X4 I have said that we are developing X3, if you will -- what we call D3, three bits per cell -- and we are now getting more confident that this can be brought to bear in NAND MLC without sacrificing performance. Then X4 is an additional, kind of the last ratchet and we have been studying what M System has been saying on the X4 and we are taking this very seriously.  The biggest barrier in MLC was going from one bits to two bits, there's a lesser barrier going from two bits to three bits and lesser barrier going from three bits to four bits and each one of these significantly increases the complexity.  So certainly our engineers never a dull moment and it's actually very exciting. What you have seen is going from one bit to two bits per cell which is the easiest part; has been not at all easy for the rest of the industry. You should expect that going beyond two bits per cell will not be easy and I think it's definitely a system solution where we excel.
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Just a quick question for Judy. Just to coordinate my math to get the down 55% year-over-year suggests that pricing is a bit more stable in 4Q than in 3Q. Does that sound right?
Judy Bruner:  I think you could get to 55% if pricing in the fourth quarter was in the mid-teens to slightly high teens; not that dissimilar from Q2 or Q3.
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners:  Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator:  We'll take our next question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Amanda Hindlian - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, this is Amanda Hindlian in for Jim Covello. My first question is can you update us on any progress you've made toward adding new licensees?
Eli Harari: Yes. We are in discussions with a number of companies that are interested in licensing our technology, but I can't comment at this stage.
Amanda Hindlian - Goldman Sachs: Any updates on the litigation front?
Eli Harari:  Nothing more than what you know already. The ITC action against SD Micro is proceeding I think the trial is scheduled now for October.
Amanda Hindlian - Goldman Sachs: Then can you help me understand if the supply and demand dynamics are coming into balance in Q3, why the pricing is coming down so much?
Eli Harari: The pricing is not coming down any more really than what we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. I would say, in fact, our pricing has come down in a pretty systematic way rather than in leaps and starts so this is not -- last year we had a 52% price reduction for the year. This year we are saying it's going to be around 55%.  I think the key is to get this price elasticity; we are at about 750 or so megabytes per card in retail and we really need to move the market to about a gigabyte average capacity per card by the end of this year.  I think that the pricing that we are implementing achieves a predictable environment out there, we believe, and also I think are good for the market in terms of stimulating that transition to gigabyte capacity.
Amanda Hindlian - Goldman Sachs:  Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Eli Harari:  Thank you, Amanda.
Operator:  We'll move to Satya Chillara with American Technology. 
Satya Chillara - American Technology: With regard to Samsung, you talked about 55% to 59% pricing, based on that you guided right now to 55%. Do you think there is more pricing that you need to take if the demand is not that good going into Q4, or is that pretty much what you have in mind?
Eli Harari: I think with the pricing for the third quarter as well as the cumulative effect of the first two quarters, we think things are doing fine. My expectations and hope, if you will, is that by the end of this summer we will be in balance and that the cumulative effect will allow the market to move to higher densities and soak up additional demand.  I can't speak for Samsung, you really have to talk to them. But remember that Samsung sells components and we sell cards. We also sell MP3 players and we sell a lot of stuff that really is up the food chain and gives us the ability to maintain margins and not have to drive the pricing the way perhaps they've indicated for themselves.
Satya Chillara - American Technology: The reason I ask that question is I'm looking at the demand in Q4. It sounds like with all the macro climate and everything, the demand is not out there and that's why I think it's reducing the prices. You seem to be pretty confident going into Q4. The other question I have is Q4 looks like Q4 of 2004 with respect to the bit growth and so on. Is that what you have in mind at this point?
Eli Harari: Q4 of 2004 was very demanding. I think we reported 110% in megabyte shift. I doubt it. I think we've had very good growth this quarter. Judy has guided you to about 20%, 25% in megabytes in the third quarter. We are still confident about 180% to 190%, but I think 110% or so in the fourth quarter would blow away. 
Judy Bruner:  Yes. Let me just add, I'm not going to step you through the math here, but if you go do the math of various potential bit growths for Q4, clearly we would expect bit growth in Q4 to be quite a bit higher than in Q3, but not at the level of 2004, not at 110%. It doesn't need to be near that level to get you to 180% to 190% for the year.
Satya Chillara - American Technology:  No, understood. One last question. Judy, this is for you. The non-captive mix for second half, can you walk us through what you're thinking, please? What it would be for Q3 and Q4?
Judy Bruner:  As I said on the call, we expect in Q3 that the non-captive mix of our shipments will be similar or perhaps less than the non-captive mix in Q2. But we've not yet provided guidance for Q4. Clearly that's a decision we haven't made yet as to what the mix is we'll need in Q4.
Eli Harari:  The real method Satya is that by withholding our guidance for the total of the unit shipments and reducing our requirements for non-captive, this is basically reflective of the progress we are making with captive output increasing quite substantially relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year, both year to yield and accelerated production ramp.  So there is nothing wrong with the non-captive supply. What it is is the captive supply is doing exceptionally well in these quarters and we are taking advantage of the flexibility of our model.
Satya Chillara - American Technology:  Right. Okay. Good. Thank you very much.
Eli Harari:  Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Gurinder Kalra with CIBC.
Gurinder Kalra - CIBC: Thanks. I have two questions. The first question is to what do you attribute the recent price weakness? Is it just slow demand from handsets? Do you think a competitor failed to build out certain products in time? Conversely, why do you think we will see a supply/demand balance later in the third quarter?
Eli Harari: I think the price weakness may have something to do with the pricing late in the second quarter, which has carried over into the beginning of the third quarter. Basically with the exception of very good June sell through, we are now into the July, August months. Really there's no catalyst for a huge increase. We do believe that you are going to start seeing some substantial ordering towards the holidays; Black Friday and so on in the September/October timeframe.  So there's nothing surprising here. This is quite seasonal and quite normal. I think basically demand is going to catch up with supply even as supply is ramping up.
Gurinder Kalra - CIBC:  All right. Thanks. The second question is you give a non-captive mix in shipments in the third quarter, how about in terms of costs?
Judy Bruner: We've never provided guidance as to the exact percentage of non-captive that is in the cost of sales. That's a little more difficult to arrive at based upon our retail sell-through revenue recognition. Clearly the amount of non-captive that is recognized in our cost of sales is lagged a bit from the percentage that is in the shipments.
Gurinder Kalra - CIBC:  Okay. Thanks.
Eli Harari:  In other words, the inventory that we have that is selling through represents the costs in the last two quarters, not in the current quarter.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC:  Congratulations on a great quarter. A few questions. Number one, with regard to microSD, can you talk to the mix of bundled versus aftermarket? Obviously that seems to have grown, but what would you say the percentages are right now?
Judy Bruner: Well, for the current quarter, clearly the majority of the growth is still coming in the OEM bundled sales of microSD. The retail sales did grow as well from Q1 to Q2. I believe last quarter we indicated that there were about 2 million units of microSD that had sold through retail. We've not provided a specific number this quarter, but we did see some growth there and we believe we are continuing to see traction in the sale of microSD in retail.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC:  And as far as average densities in that segment of the market?
Judy Bruner:  Yes. Actually, I mentioned in my comments that the growth in average capacity of microSD was the fastest growing capacity in our retail sales.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: What would you say is the most popular density right now? Do you see that growing at a very nice clip towards the end of the year?
Eli Harari: I think in retail microSD is at 512 megabyte and a great deal of 1 gigabyte now. In bundled, I have said we process by model. You've got 512 megabytes for music applications, and the lower capacity for basically just basic bundle.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: Just switching gears a second. With regard to U3, I've heard already that there are a number of competing controller manufacturers who have indicated to me at least that they are looking to support U3. What is the licensing front looking like to you?
Eli Harari: We have set up U3 LLC, a licensing entity that is chartered to license to all comers the U3 technology and the logo, and so on. I believe they are doing their job. Seeing a great deal of interest in controller manufacturers and other USB Flash manufacturers to get into this market. This is precisely what M Systems and SanDisk set out to do.
Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC: The last question would be with regard to the void of Lexar being out of the market, what would you characterize what's happened in the market with regard to being rid of the crazy ede in the market? Is there a big void that you're filling, or are you seeing more stability in the market right now with Lexar gone?
Eli Harari:  No. Lexar first of all is not gone. They are still there. Secondly, if anything, they probably will be reinvigorated through the support of Micron. But Lexar has been, as you know, waning in the last two years, getting weaker over the last six to eight quarters. So their going away, the way you describe it, is really a non-event. We don't see a big difference.
Operator: Craig Ellis with Citigroup has our next question.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple clarifications to begin. First, Judy, on the gross margin line, can you just identify the relative contribution of the three factors that contributed to the sequentially higher gross margin? Were there any negative offsets to those factors you identified?
Judy Bruner: Sure. Really in terms of relative contribution, I described them in that order. So the most important factor in the gross margin being better than we had forecasted was that our retail sell through was higher than we had expected and that enabled us to recognize sooner low-cost produced supply, primarily through fab 3.  The second largest impact was the less than 15% non-captive mix within the shipments and how that translates through to cost of sales. You may recall that last quarter I said that 19% of our purchases in Q1 were non-captive. We had estimated a higher percentage of the shipments and cost of sales being non-captive in Q2 than what it actually turned out to be so that reduction was significant.  I mentioned the power upgrade being sort of a non-factor because it was more than offset by cost reductions. That really was the third on the list.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: So related to that, how should we think about the pace of cost reduction in the second half of the year versus what you achieved in the first half?
Judy Bruner: As I indicated in the guidance, we expect cost reduction to be greater in the third quarter than in the second quarter primarily because of the ramp in our 70 nanometer 300 millimeter output. What we're expecting is that price decline remains about the same, but that cost reduction accelerates.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Then you mentioned inventories up in the third quarter; can you quantify how much they would be up or where they would be, relative to the first quarter levels?
Judy Bruner:  We're not going to give a specific amount of inventory, but we believe inventory will rise. We need it to rise in order to get a jump start on Q4 in terms of shipments for the holiday season. Also, we are making good progress on expanding output of Fab 3.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Lastly, and a broader question relative to two product areas. On MP3s, can you just update us on how well you think you're progressing with your US and your worldwide expansion there? Any year-end market share targets would be helpful.  Given that you're already shipping with ten handset OEMs on the handset card side, what are the growth opportunities there other than more slots in cards?
Eli Harari:  Yes. In the MP3 market we think our storefront exposure today is still relatively small, mostly Best Buy and Circuit City. Up to this point I think you're going to see that expand a great deal in the U.S. in the second half. Also, we barely touched Europe and Asia up to this point and we plan to certainly increase our sales through these geographies in the next six months.  I can't tell you about market share. Microsoft is supposed to introduce their platform in November. It sounds a little bit late. Apple, I expect will introduce their next generation nano in September, maybe announce it in August. So it's very fluid. We are pretty comfortable with our positioning. We think that in the low price range where both of these guys are not really very strong, we are going to see very substantial opportunities. In the area of handsets, we think if you look at 15 million cards sold in the quarter, where there could be, my guess would be over 100 million units shipped in the quarter that could have a card, you see that the attach rate is very small. I think in retail the attach rate for our cards in handsets is still something like 11%, 12%; still very, very low.  So the challenge for us is to work with the mobile network operators to increase their attach rate to the level that digital cameras have, which is 100% attach rate. That just takes time and training and support point of sale material. But it's happening every quarter, I expect we will see an improved attach rate.
Craig Ellis - Citigroup: Thanks, Eli. Lastly, and just going back to an earlier question. We've had significant pricing activity quarter to date, more is planned in the third quarter. You've got density shift working to your advantages, the MP3 business grows and yet as we look at bit growth implied in the fourth quarter, it is at the low end of what we would get if we just looked at the range between the fourth quarter of '05 and the fourth quarter of '04. So it would seem that the full year bit growth outlook is pretty conservative from here, unless there's something I am missing with that. Any color on that comment?
Eli Harari: 180% to 190% is a tripling of the output. Throughout this, maintaining or improving gross margins in a very, very tough pricing environment really says a lot about our business model. I will be very pleased if it just continues to roll out the way we are guiding.
Judy Bruner: I mean we re-look at this every quarter and continue to believe our best guess is that we will fall in that range. As Eli just said, that's a pretty big increase over the last two years, in which each were closer to 165% than 180% to 190%.
Operator:  And we'll move to Pranay Laharia with Deutsche Bank.
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Can you talk about the revenue contribution from Matrix for the quarter? Are you still on track to get to $60 million to $90 million for contribution for the year?
Judy Bruner:  We really are not breaking out the revenue contribution for the 3-D products, just as we aren't breaking out revenue from any other products. We are pleased with the progress that they have made and we expect, in particular, a fairly significant amount of growth from 3-D revenue in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year.
Eli Harari:  But overall, yes, we expect to be in that range, $60 million to $90 million for the year. More of it concentrated in the second half of the year, from of course, gaming applications.
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank:  Understood. So no chance you're going to give the segment breakdown between cell phones, MP3 players, digital still camera for the quarter for 2Q?
Judy Bruner:  Not for the quarter, but we will give it at the end of the year as we have now for the last two years. So we give that total breakdown annually.
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. Can you give wafer outs for 3Q and confirm your target for March next year? And talk about whether the ramp will be linear or more back-end loaded on that?
Eli Harari:  We don't give wafer starts and we don't think it's appropriate to start that trend. There's a lot of information out there. But the ramp is progressing very nicely. I think we are now sometimes going from 70,000 wafers a month by the end of March next year to just over 90,000 wafers a month and we expect that now, that's split 50/50 between us.
Judy Bruner:  Right. So what we have said is that the wafer starts for fab 3 in Q4 of '05 were about 10,000 per month, growing to about 30,000 per month in Q1 of '06 and that by the end of Q1 '07 we expect to be at about 90,000 wafers per month split 50/50 between the two partners. We continue to be on that ramp. We're doing well.
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank:  Fair enough. Just a last question. Remind me when you expect G bits per cell to be a commercial reality for you guys?
Eli Harari:  We have not said when we're going to have that, but I would not say it's imminent.
Pranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank:  Great. Thank you.
Lori Barker Padon:  Okay. We'll have time for two more callers. Thank you.
Operator:  We'll move to Mark Edelstone, Morgan Stanley.
Jay Iyer - Morgan Stanley:  Hi, everyone, this Jay Iyer for Mark Edelstone and let me give my congratulations on a solid quarter as well.
Eli Harari:  Thank you.
Jay Iyer - Morgan Stanley:  Judy, if you could just break out the stock-based compensation expense between the SG&A and R&D lines, please?
Judy Bruner: The total stock compensation expense for the quarter is about $26 million. There is about $3 million in cost of sales, the rest of it in operating expenses. I don't have right in front of me the breakout between R&D and sales and marketing. I'll have to get that separately.
Jay Iyer - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. You talked about your supply expectations for the second half. Would you care to guess where it might be in 2007?
Eli Harari:  We have not changed our long-term model of 70% captive, 30% non-captive. Clearly, we are diverging quite a bit now as we are ramping. I can see a situation where we would get back to certainly above 20% non-captive next year.
Judy Bruner: I have the breakdown here. So R&D included a little over $10 million of stock compensation expense. Sales and marketing included a little over $5 million and G&A close to $8 million.
Jay Iyer - Morgan Stanley:  Great. Thank you again.
Eli Harari:  Thank you.
Operator:  We'll move to go Mark Fitzgerald with Bank of America.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America:  Just curious given you're in the MP3 player marketplace with the emergence of combining the cell phone and the MP3 player, does the silicon content, particularly the Flash content go up, stay the same, or go down if you were to combine versus having the two stand-alone products?
Eli Harari:  It definitely goes up. I don't think we would have seen the kind of demand for microSD and 512 megabytes and gigabyte if it were not for the music applications. The digital cameras and the cell phones are still relatively low resolution. It's definitely the MP3, the music functionality that's driving the demand for high capacity cards in cell phones.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: That takes into consideration that there's not an MP3 player that would be sold, or it would cannibalize an MP3 player?
Eli Harari:  The MP3 market is a stand-alone market. The handset market we have always believed will ultimately be the MP3 biggest market opportunity and we have put lots of resources to make sure that when that happens and as it happens that we are a major player.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America:  Thank you.
Eli Harari:  So if you look at Nokia, music players; Sony Ericsson, Walkman, music players, cell phones that is; Motorola’s MP3 players in the cell phones, they are customers of our high-capacity cards. Either microSD or Memory Stick Produo.  I'd really like to wrap up this conference call. I think it's been a great quarter. Thank you very much for joining us today. You can see we are pretty excited about the opportunities ahead of us and looking forward to seeing you all in the coming meetings and investor conferences. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.

We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference. Now, I’d like to turn our call over to our CEO, Eli Harari.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Thank you Lori. I’m Eli Harari. I’ll talk today on just a few of our first quarter events and I’ll discuss general developments in our markets. In the first quarter, we sold a record of just under $13 million mobile handset cards. To give you an idea of what’s going on here, in the first quarter of 2006, our mobile card revenues grew to 30% of total product revenues out from just 7% in the first quarter of 2005 and 21% in the prior quarter. Within our mobile sales, we are particularly encouraged by growth in the retail market, which approached 2 million units sold, accounting for 25% of the mobile card revenues in the first quarter. This suggests a very positive consumer usage pattern that we have been patiently nuturing over the past three years. In this space, we continue to develop excellent relationships with virtually all major handset manufacturers, network operators on a global basis, and content owners. In April, we began shipping to retailers the new products that we announced in the first quarter at the Consumer Electronic Show, EBIT, PMA, and CTIA. Particularly, we are excited about our new Sansa e200 audio player that has received a number of excellent reviews and which we believe will help us solidify our number two market position this year in audio players. Switching to operations, in the first quarter, Fab 3 achieved average wafer ramp of 30,000 wafers per month with mature yields on 90 nanometer technology, 4 gigabit 300 mm wafers. In March, we commenced the Fab 3 conversion to 70 nanometer, which we expect to complete over the next two quarters. By next March, we expect Fab 3 capacity to reach 70,000 wafers per month, hopefully including first production out of 55 nanometer NAND/MLC. In the second half of the first quarter, the product exceeding demand, confirming the timeliness of our preemptive price moves early in the quarter. The current pricing environment, although challenging to our competitors, is fundamental to our industry and works in two very positive ways. First, it simulates price elastic demand and is therefore critically important to absorption of significant new capacity coming also in this year from our sales as well as competitors. Secondly, dealers and suppliers that are playing catch up to the leading-edge NAND/MLC maybe more cautious converting the new capacity to NAND as they have done in the past 18 months when NAND was much more profitable for them. Judy will provide you guidance on the new price moves that we are implementing for the second quarter, that are somewhat more modest than in the first quarter and that are designed to further stimulate consumer demand for gigabyte capacities and setting the stage of a more healthy balance between demand and supply in the second half of the year. On April 4, 2006, we announced with Toshiba our intention to commence construction of a new joint NAND Fab that will be of Yokkaichi Fab 4. Fab 4 is being planned as a highly advanced dedicated NAND mega fab with operation, financing, and output. We’ll follow closely the successful model we and Toshiba have established in our joint Fab tree. Fab 4 is expected to generate substantial new capacity selling in 2008 through 2012 and should allow us to continue to develop new markets for our products and strengthen our marketshare in current and new geographies. We’ve chosen Yokkaichi for site of our tree as the most efficient site because that is where the technology development, engineering, and manufacturing is concentrated. We believe that for future profits technology transition is critical for competitiveness in our business and with the complexity of each successive generation of NAND/MLC there are significant advantages to exploiting the knowledge and experience that we and Toshiba have dealt at Yokkaichi. In the next three to five years Yokkaichi is expected to become one of the industries largest production facilities for NAND Flash Memory and this allow us to capture powerful ___. We view this Fab 4 as a core strategic decision for SanDisk, which should afford us opportunities for potential growth in revenues and for stability in the second half of this decade. Now, let me switch gears and discuss briefly current events in our competitive landscape. In March Micron and Lexar announced their intention to merge. In the past three years, Lexar’s financial results and roughly declining marketshare have demonstrated the immense difficulties for a small player in such a hugely competitive market, and recent public filings have shown that Lexar actively solicited a large number of potential acquirers. We believe that the Lexar acquisition is currently advertised, does not alleviate Micron’s challenges of catching up with leading-edge NAND/MLC, production becoming a factor in mobile cards where Lexar today is not a player, and addressing their IT situations. As for the current rumors involving SanDisk potential interest in Lexar, our longstanding policy is not to comment on rumors, and I have no intention to deviate from that policy today. We continue to focus on protecting our IT with our recent actions, citing three patterns at ITC against ST Micron. We have other cases pending in the District Court system that we believe is the ITC venue will be a FAS extract, and we hope for a positive ITC outcome by the middle of 2007. Just a brief update on our acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor. The integration is going very well and our top priority now is on growing our new archival OTP, one-time programmable 3D memory business, for blank PDS as well as for content distribution in the coming years. We are excited about the enormous future potentials of 3D memory and are actively accelerating investments in future-generation 3D technologies. In summary, at SanDisk we are invigorated by all these opportunities and competitive challenges. Although, we’ve had to fight marginal depression in the first quarter and expect more so in the second quarter, we remain optimistic about 2006 as a whole. We continue to reduce our costs. We are executing with our partner, Toshiba, a powerful long-term capacity expansion strategy throughout leading edge Fab’s. We continue to relentlessly grow our retial store fronts, create innovative serial products, and aggressively build our IT portfolio. Our markets in the cellphones, small Flash drives, audio and video players, and gaming are very young and on the verge of rapid growth in the years ahead. Judy…
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: Thank you Eli. Our first quarter product revenue was up 35% year-over-year and seasonally down 21% sequentially. In comparison, our product revenue in the first quarter of 2005 was also down 21% sequentially, although with a very different change in megabytes and prices. This first quarter our megabyte sold increased 4% sequentially as we began to see capacities respond to our the first quarter price decreases, which resulted in an average decrease in ASP per megabyte of 24%. In the first quarter a year ago, megabyte sold were down 13% sequentially with a much more modest 10% decline in ASP per megabyte. Our retail revenue in the first quarter was up 18% year-over-year and down 29% sequentially. Retail megabytes sold were down very slightly on a sequential basis as the 19% growth in average retail capacity largely offset the seasonal decline in retail units. Looking at our retail business by end market, we experienced sequential growth in terms of units and dollars in USB products and in mobile phone cards. With supply constraints over, we were able to gain share in the USB market. In the mobile market, we experienced strong retail growth in both the miniSD and the microSD cards. Our OEM revenue was up 100% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially with a strong sequential increase in units overcoming the decline in ASP per megabyte. Our OEM revenue continues to be dominated by the mobile card business that now also includes sale of 3D product, which we acquired via the Matrix acquisition in January. The 3D products are currently concentrated in the gaming market. Our OEM business represented 31% of our product revenues for the first quarter, up from 23% in the fourth quarter 2005 and 21% in the first quarter 2005. On a geographic basis, our product revenue mix in the first quarter was 43% Americas, 34% Europe, and 23% other international regions. Compared to last quarter, this represents a 10 percentage point increase in the mix of sales from Europe, which primarily reflects an encouraging sequential increase in retail revenue in Europe and the seasonally soft retail market in the US. I want to point out that I started last quarter providing regional revenue based upon the territory from which we received the PO rather than the territory to which we ship. As our OEM sales for the mobile business has been growing, we believe the PO territory is more relevant than the shipped territory, which often reflects the location of the contract manufacturers of the handset company. License and royalty revenue of $85.5 million was up 67% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, with growth driven primarily by MLC royalties and seasonal growth in our licensee sales in the fourth quarter, which we recognized as royalty revenue in the first quarter. Product gross margin in the first quarter of 28.4% was below the 30-32% range we had estimated for two primary reasons, higher than forecasted period costs related to higher inventory levels and a power outage experienced in Fab 3 in the first quarter. Incremental inventory reserves recorded in the first quarter represented approximately 1.5 points of product gross margin. In the latter part of February, Fab 3 experienced a power interruption caused by a transformer failure. While the power interruption was brief, some of the end process lots were scrapped and significant costs were incurred to bring the tools back online. This impacted the first quarter by approximately 1 point of gross margins. The mix of our shipments from non-captive supply was approximately 32% in the range we previously forecasted. Looking at purchases rather than shipments, non-captives was approximately 19% of our first quarter purchases, and we will temporarily further reduce our non-captive purchase mix in the second quarter to allow us to align total inventory with market demand given our growing captive supply. This lower mix of non-captive supply should begin to have a positive impact on the second quarter costs, but because the majority of our revenue is recognized based on sell through from the channel, the lower non-captive purchases in the first quarter and the second quarter will primarily benefit our gross margins in the third quarter. The current environment is a good example of why we believe a 70/30 captive non-captive mix is the right long-term strategy as it provides us significant flexibility to adjust our supply in response to fluctuating market demand. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter was $180 million included a one-time charge of $40 million for the value technology in process at the time of our acquisition of Matrix. Operating expenses also included $3.7 million for amortization of intangible assets, primarily related to the Matrix acquisition. These assets are being amortized over periods of three to seven years. Through 2008, the amortization expense will be at a rate of approximately $4.5 million per quarter. With the implementation of FAS 123R, the first quarter operating expenses include approximately $19 million for the estimated value of stock incentives during the quarter. There was no stock compensation expense in cost of sales during the first quarter as the value of stock incentives for supply chain personnel of approximately $2.5 million was recorded in inventory. In future quarters, cost of sales will include stock compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluding stock compensation and acquisition-related charges were approximately $118 million, up from $104 million last quarter with the increase coming primarily from increase to R&D for our new 3D business from 55 nanometer NAND technology development and from legal costs related to protecting our intellectual property. Excluding stock compensation and acquisition-related accounting charges, operating income was $120 million or 19.4% of revenue, compared to $114 million or 25.2% in the first quarter of last year. While operating margin of 19.3% is slightly below our annual target model of 20-24%, it is still robust profitability in a quarter with steep price declines and seasonally soft demand. GAAP operating income was $58 million or 9.3% of revenue. Other income of $18 million increased by $4 million from the prior quarters to the higher interest rates on our higher cash investments as well as certain non-recurring gains. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased to 35% from the previous level of 37%. On a GAAP basis, our tax rate was approximately 54% with the primary difference being that the non-cash book charge of $40 million for in-process technology is a discrete item that is not tax deductible. In addition, there is no tax benefit for book purposes from the vesting of incentive stock options since the tax impact of those options cannot be determined until they are exercised in full. While we are currently only granting non-qualified stock options, we do have incentive stock options that are still vesting and contributing to our stock compensation expense. Our diluted shares now include the 3.7 million shares issued in January for the Matrix acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, which is comparable to GAAP results last year, our net income was $90 million, up 21% from the year ago quarter or $0.44 per share, up 13% from the year ago quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.75 billion of cash and short-term investments, up $54 million from last quarter. The implementation of FAS 123R has resulted in a change in the presentation of the cash flow statement. The cash tax benefit received by the company from the exercise of stock options was previously part of cash flow from operations but is now shown in cash flow from financing. For the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was a positive $52 million, and we generated $46 million in cash from employee stock programs and $42 million from the related tax benefits. Investing activities for the first quarter included $43 million of equity investment in Flash Partners for Fab 3 equipment and $53 million of investment in SanDisk capital equipment, primarily for manufacturing, assembly, and test equipment. In addition to our equity investment in Flash Partners, we also guaranteed additional operating leases of approximately $150 million, which does not appear on the balance sheet but will be reported in our 10-Q. Accounts receivables decreased $83 million, reflecting seasonality as well as the impact of price protection credits given for inventory in the channel at the time of our first quarter price reduction. DSO was 42 days at the end of the first quarter. Inventory increased $82 million due to the combination of ramping Fab 3 output and the first quarter seasonally soft shipments. As I mentioned earlier, we are significantly reducing non-captive purchases in the second quarter given our current inventory level. Channel inventory at the end of the quarter stood at about 10.5 weeks based on the last four weeks of sell through, which was faster in March than we had expected. Channel inventory as of the higher end of the range we typically see, and this is one factor which leads us to plan price reductions in the second quarter at a higher rate than we expected as we entered the year. A final comment on the balance sheet is that it reflects several changes resulting from the Matrix acquisition. Intangible assets increased by $98 million and goodwill increased by $162 million due to the purchase accounting for the Matrix acquisition. As is normal with purchase accounting, the goodwill balance will be adjusted over the next few quarters as we fine tune certain matrix related assets and liabilities, primarily tax related. I’ll now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and certain comments on the year. Let me remind you that the forward-looking comments I am about to make are subject to risks and uncertainties as described at the beginning of this call and in our periodic SEC filings, and we do not intend to update these comments or forecasts prior to the next quarterly conference call. We expect our ASP per megabyte to decline approximately 20% sequentially in the second quarter. This forecasted reduction in ASP per megabyte reflects price mix and promotions as well as the impact of increasing card capacities, which are priced at a lower price per megabyte. We expect our average capacities to continue upward stimulated by our first quarter and second quarter mix. We expect our megabyte sod to increase approximately 35-45% sequentially in the second quarter. For the full year 2006, we continue to expect megabyte sold to increase between 180% and 190% and our ASP per megabyte to decline 50-55%. We expect the second quarter license and royalty revenue to be between $75 million and $80 million, down from the first quarter since our second quarter royalty revenue reflects sales of our licensees and the seasonally softer first quarter. We continue to estimate approximately $350 million in license and royalty revenue for 2006. We expect product gross margin for the second quarter, excluding the impact of stock compensation, to be in the range of 28-30%. Our forecast of 20% price decline for the second quarter is higher than we anticipated at the start of the year as we are continuing to proactively reduce prices to stimulate demand and move channel inventory and new production output. In addition, there will be some cost in the second quarter related to a plan shutdown of Fab 3 that was implemented in early April in order to make power modifications that are expected to significantly reduce the chances of an unplanned outage in the future. Our lower non-captive purchases will begin to have a positive impact on the second quarter but will primarily affect third quarter cost of sales. On a GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to be approximately 0.5 percentage point lower than our non-GAAP guidance due to the inclusion of stock compensation which was recorded in inventory in the first quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter of approximately $130 million up from the first quarter to primarily new product development and 55 nanometer technology development as well as investments in our retail branding campaign and that we believe will have a positive return over the long term and a positive impact on sales and marketshare in the second half of this year. We expect stock compensation to be approximately $25 million in the second quarter, including the impact of our annual stock option grant which were made in March. Amortization of intangibles should be approximately $4.5 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 35% for the second quarter and the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 37% for the second quarter. We expect to make cash investments in Flash Partners in the second quarter of approximately $200 million. Given the investments ahead for Fab 3 and also Fab 4, which will begin in the second half of 2007, we are pursuing additional re-financing as well as exploring other financing alternatives. We expect inventory levels to remain approximately flat from the first quarter to the second quarter as we reduce non-captive purchases and continue to ramp Fab 3. In summary, the supply-demand balance in the first half of this year is somewhat challenging; however, we remain focused on our strategies for the long term and continue to forecast attractive growth in sales and non-GAAP profits for 2006. We’ll now open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, if you’d like to register your site for a question, you may do so by pressing the “*” key followed by the digit “1” on your touchtone telephone. If you’re using a speaker phone please make sure that your mute function is turned on so that your signal can reach our equipment. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press “*” on your touchtone telephone at this time. We’ll pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal. We’ll take our first question from the site of Craig Ellis with Citigroup, please go ahead.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: Thanks, good afternoon everybody. First on the qualification, Judy, with the two items that you identified impacting product gross margins in the first quarter that had been forecasted period costs in the Fab 3 power outage, was that a combined impact of 150 or 250 basis points?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: That was a combined impact of about 250 basis points, so that 150 related to the inventory reserves and about 100 related to the power outage.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: So, with the absence of those factors in the second quarter, would we be seeing a more significant uptake in margins sequentially?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: Well, as I indicated, there will still be costs in the second quarter relating to the power aspect…there’s a plan, so in particular Fab 3 was brought down in early April in order to make power modifications to ensure that an unplanned outage is less likely to happen in the future and also to add capacity. So there are costs related to that planned shutdown in the second quarter, so the impact of the power situation really impacted both quarters.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: Okay great, and then switching gears on the product side, can you just identify the MP3 product category as one where you’re really playing quite seriously this year with a broad product line, can you identify for us how that product rollout is going to proceed geographically and across the various channels that you plan consumer big box office, etc.?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: The e200 which we are beginning to ship, as we speak in volumes, basically runs up our MP3 offering. What our retailers are telling us is that they very much like to have an attractive high-end offering so that they can cover…in fact as we’ve said in the past we see our strength really in the mid pricing and the lower pricing where we can move a lot of units, so the e200 really runs up the product offering. We expect to start rolling out in a pretty strong drive this month in the US, and this quarter also we’ll go overseas to Europe.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: Okay, and then lastly you mentioned the significance you’re having on the hard drive with your handset offers, can you just mention what you’re seeing with respect to I-NAND designs, whether it be in handsets or other applications?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: I-NAND is basically a system on the chip. It was shown in the past quarter with the Sony Walkman videophone that has received rave reviews. It’s basically replacing a microdrive functionality and that product has generated tremendous amount of interest from other handset manufacturers. So, we expect this will be a nice product for the embedded side. It will take some time for designing the Sony Ericsson phone and represents the designer tilt last year.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: Okay, and if could ask just one more, Eli you talked a lot about the potential for geographic expansion of getting the capacity now, as you look at your opportunity with MP3 players, handsets, and geographic expansion, how would you rate those growth factors this year?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Well, we think that we’re just starting with the MP3 product. We have not actually covered even the US distribution for MP3 players and we’re pretty confident that we can make significant inroads with MP3 player sales in Europe, in Asia-Pacific and so on, so this is really just the beginning of the road for us. And of course at the end of the day we do believe that the biggest market opportunities for MP3 players, audio players, is in the handset market and this is really where very, very strong penetration is positioning us, very, very well in the handset MP3 market.
Craig Ellis, Citigroup: Okay, Judy and Eli, thanks, and I guess given all that, 35-45% dip was pretty much of a distraction in the second quarter.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Thank you Craig.
Operator: Again it is the site of Satya Chillara with American Technology Research, please go ahead.
Satya Chillara, American Technology Research: Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Eli, can you walk us through the mobile cards that you talked about, 2 million units sold in the first quarter, if you can hit which region you’re seeing this retail uptake against your assumption, what is that you see for retail mobile cost in the second quarter?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Satya, the 2 million cards that I mentioned were to be sold in retail. We sold a total of approximately 13 million mobile cards, of course the vast majority was bundled, but this was very, very good for us as I mentioned in my script, because as you well know the model that we’re seeing with digital cameras is that you start to bundle and eventually the market needs to retail, and we’ve been working really very, very hard, particularly in Europe, Japan, and the United States. The United States really lags the rest of the world. So, I would say the strongest retail sales for mobile cards has been in Europe, very, very strong reception in sales, but it’s picking up in the United States and we have very good agreements relationships to launch in retail in the United States, I’d say all the major MNOs, not for corporates.
Satya Chillara, American Technology Research: Eli on that note, can you quantify the retail mobile card density?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: The density is basically bimodal. You have the 64 and 128 megabytes on the low end and the 512 megabytes and 1 gigabytes on the high end. The 1 gigabyte and 512 megabyte is going to be the sweet spot for MP3 functionality and for video, and the 64 megabyte and 128 is basically just for midrange handsets where it’s just really the minimum capacity to get the phone up. I think the average capacity that we’ve seen for all OEM cards, which is dominated by mobile cards, and the 206 megabytes compared to 660 megabytes in retail…so I would expect in time for this to increase as these phones become 3 megapixel and video enabled and more importantly audio enabled, that density for mobile cards will increase particularly in retail. Retail sales of course are mostly 512 megabytes, I believe.
Satya Chillara, American Technology Research: So based on all these, Eli, have you changed your views on your cellphone demand for the entire year, based on the uptake that you’re seeing in the retail which is 15% off, your OEM on the handset cards, have you changed your opinion, do you feel more bullish, if you can talk about that?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Satya, you know, we are very bullish. We are certainly not as bullish as you are because I know you are very bullish. We are very bullish on this thing, but we think it’ll take time. You know, in the United States it is taking time to get the V Plus programs out for people to really take advantage. The tax rate in mobile phone, in retail, is still very, very low, it’s under 10% tax rate, but the numbers are very large. So every percentage point increasing our tax rate is very highly leveraged, our market share as you know in mobile cards is in the mid 90s; I mean it’s very, very high. So, there’s tremendous upside potential. We’re still impacting, I believe, a very small portion of opportunities really just touching the surface, very well positioned, but I want to caution that it does take time for consumers to…buy cards in this handset.
Satya Chillara, American Technology Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the site of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much. Judy, quick question first on the pricing, if we aggregate the first quarter and second quarter pricing, down 44-45%, full year down 50-55%, you had previously said that ASPs would be down every quarter. Do you think differently about that now, do you think pricing will be up sequentially in the second half, in one of the quarters?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: I doubt that pricing would ever be up in one of the quarters, so we expect our ASP per megabyte to always go down, and that we believe the same in the second half, although we’re optimistic that the price decline in the second half will be somewhat moderated from the first half.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Price increases are…
Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs: But I guess the point is there’s not really any dip in 45 for the first half and 50-55% for the full year, really to me implies very little.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Yeah, we do believe that by being preemptive hopefully that will do the trick for the second half.
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: But actually Jim you need to look at the pricing on a year-over-year basis. So, for example, in the first quarter the pricing was down about 49% percent year-over-year, so you need to look through the math each quarter to get an estimate in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and the third quarter and the fourth quarter can continue to move down to reach the 50-55% average 2006 over average 2005.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: The important thing for us, our focus is on cost reduction of course, and in the first quarter getting our 70 nanometer to really impact Fab 3 we believe is going to make a very, very big impact on our cost structure for the second half of the year. We’re not going to leave money on the table, we’re not going to unnecessarily drive pricing down, there’s no benefit whatsoever in that. On the other hand, with the industry projecting 180% increase in megabyte for the year, there needs to be a similar demand to fill the supply or else we will all suffer. So the preemptive nature of this is, I believe, quite healthy.
Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs: Can you also help us understand a little bit about how this spot or the contract market and how your pricing kind of ties? I know that there’s a lag and your pricing doesn’t go down as much as the spot, can you help give us some color around how we should think about those two tying together?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: The spot pricing as you know in last two weeks of March were atrocious and some people dumping inventory at our cost, which I think was really not a good idea. We do not of course engage in any such activity. We see it as very, very counterproductive and we believe it’s very important to have steady, stable, and well-understood pricing directions as best we can. We of course don’t control pricing, but we do the best we can to avoid supplies as far as what we think needs to be done. Spot pricing has now recovered as you know. So, we think in terms of quantity, specifically it’s a very small percentage of the market and I think retailers have gotten smart to understand that long-term relationships are very, very important, more important than opportunistic purchases. And I can’t say that…sometimes do have an impact. When there is excess supply, they do have temporary impact and it’s very important not to over react to them.
Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs: Terrific, one more question from me, then I’ll go away. As Micron and Hynix ramped up their production of NAND, at what point does it make sense for you guys to start to enforce your patterns against some of the newer players in the industry? Thanks very much.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: You know, clearly Hynix is a very strong comer and number three player and you know that Toshiba has taken action against them. We have said with regards to Micron that we believe they do need to take a license for our patent. We have an overall strategy that we don’t want to try and take over ____. We want to go after the major infringes at the right time and you will hear about it when and if it happens.
Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the site of Paul Coster with JP Morgan
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: Thank you, a few quick questions. Judy, can I just make sure that I’ve understood this that the product mix was a neutral factor from a gross margin perspective?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: Yes, product mix was not a big factor in our gross margins in the first quarter.
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: The inventory that you have on hand now, can you give us some sense of how that breaks up, in the sense of finished product versus working progress, raw materials?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: Yeah, what I would say is that the increase we saw in inventory from the fourth quarter to the first quarter about half of that increase is in raw material and working process and about half of that increase is in finished goods, and there’s not any significant issue in the inventory in terms of mix of products. It is generally just more quantity, more volume than we would like to see.
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: I mean it seems to be a record level actually, is that correct?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: Yes, that’s correct, although with a growing business you would over time expect the inventory to continue to grow. So, it being a record level is not necessarily surprising, but overall we would like to see the inventory lower, the inventory both on our balance sheet as well as the inventory in the channel.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Let me add, Paul. We saw focus and increase in megabyte shift relative to the fourth quarter, which was clearly a record quarter for megabyte shift, but internally we got a 0-10% increase in megabytes for the first quarter and quite honestly, internally we were more bullish than that. The whole of last year being on allocation, not having enough capacity and we did plan…I mean internally our plan was more aggressive than the guidance of course. Basically U.S. retail particularly in March was softer than we expected even though seasonally it was no different than the first quarter last year. So, just maybe bullion and we are not perfect, sometimes we overshoot it, but it’s okay. I think we need to bring it down and we are taking the right options to do so.
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: I’m amazed to hear you say you’re not perfect…just one last question then, generally the holiday season sees the influx of some new applications and I guess that many of us are expecting portable media players and of course even some solid state laptops, perhaps hybrid to come to market, how significant are those two products for this year’s holiday season?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: I think the portable media player you hear a lot. Apparently it’s becoming quite popular and I would expect to see the first attractive products from several suppliers this holiday season. I think it maybe a year or so before you get toward MP3 players this year or maybe next Christmas, but I would not be surprised if in this business you’re going to see some of these products.
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: Okay, one last question to Judy, it sounds like gross margins are going to spring back quite sharply in the third quarter owing to this shift to captive production, will it be above the sort of normal 30-34% kind of level that we’ve seen in the past, do you think it can spring up to the mid 30s or higher?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: You know, Paul, we’re not prepared to give gross margin guidance yet on the second path of the year, but we do expect gross margins to be better in the second half of the year both because of the reduced non-captive purchases that we’re making now which will largely impact the second half and because our current expectation is that price movement will be less in the second half than in the first half and we’re continuing to achieve cost reduction, in particular in Fab 3 as we’ve really just begun the move to 70 nanometer in Fab 3.
Paul Coster, JP Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the site of Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities, please go ahead.
Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities: Yes, as you look at some of the competitive capacity coming on, Eli, can you give us the overall assessment of industry supply and demand here in the second quarter and going into the second half as you sort of aggregate industry capital spending and then Flash on your earlier comments on the ___ guys becoming a little more cautious on conversion?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: I think that they are moving as fast as they can to bring up new capacity, but I think that Hynix, for example, is I believe exhausted most of the capacity that they can allocate…and if you listen to some of these guys quarterly, see more sensors, where towards the end of the first quarter more profitable or more revenues for wafers for these guys because they’re not on the most advanced leading edge technology. In order to get to be on leading edge, they need to put in 70 nanometer capacity with that, and until they do so their output, 204 gigabit chips, may not be very attractive as far as revenues for wafer. But that said, putting the paranoia hat, we have to assume that the industry will increase their output by close to 200%, triple the megabyte shift this year, most of it coming in the second half, and it is critical that we get consumers to shift to higher densities and create the new markets and the applications. This is not just for the benefit of all of us, but of course it would be nice if these newcomers…
Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities: And my second question is in the mobile card market, what is the typical density of phone and mobile cards and you said you have 90-95% of that market, with that retail market emerging, do you see consumers also looking at non-grinded alternatives to the basic bundles that they buy?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Let me answer the first question. The 90% of marketshare is NPD data that was published I think yesterday just for the US retail. I’m not saying that we have that kind of market share in mobile cards worldwide. This is a brand new market and it’s actually a quite slow market…we sold 2 million cards in retail and I’m sure that much more than 2 million cards were sold worldwide. In that situation, that market share will not be sustainable going forward. As far as the capacity, we do expect retail mobile card capacity to be absolutely in the 512 megabytes/1 gigabyte sweet spot as opposed to bundles, which often is 64 and 128 megabytes, and I’m not sure I answered all your questions.
Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities: I think the final piece was the C&A, as consumers augment the basic bundled capacity that they buy, do you see any trend that consumers can look at non-branded alternatives for adding mobile cards similar to what we’ve seen in digital cameras.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Non-branded, you mean…
Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities: Non-SanDisk…brand preference…mobile cards.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Right, we’ve made TransFlash into an industry standard by making it available through industry wide licensing through the ____microSD and we clearly see the benefits of having other suppliers coming into the market. As much as we would like to have very large market share, we at other times do create new opportunities in the market and establish standards. That’s the best way to combat…try to establish different standards such as, for example, MMCmicro. So, it’s a double-edged sword. I mean it’s really important to create competition in the free market, I don’t mean royalty free, I mean free market.
Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to ____, please go ahead.
Unknown Analyst: Thanks. Maybe you didn’t give this, but could you tell us how much do you expect non-captive portion to be in the second half of the year?
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President and CFO: I don’t think we would be prepared to talk about non-captive purchases yet for the second half of the year. However, I will say that over the long-term we remain convinced that the 70-30 mix is about the right mix and you can see the flexibility that it affords us in different market environments. So, clearly we are bringing our non-captive purchases down pretty significantly this quarter. It’s too early to say what that mix will be for the second half.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: And you have to understand of course that we have a very strong obligation to our suppliers to not jerk them around anymore than is absolutely necessary.
Unknown Analyst: And how much of planning or I guess leap time do you need to give your non-captive supplier in order…
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Typically, two to three months.
Unknown Analyst: Two to three months, okay.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: You don’t want to jerk them after they’ve already started their wafers. Eventually, it’s going to come, it’s best that way if it isn’t started, if you don’t need it.
Unknown Analyst: Okay, great thanks. I just have one follow-on question. In terms of embedded versus removable in handsets, what are the trends you saw in first quarter and are you seeing that embedded as hoarding gets placed as far as the second quarter is concerned?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Yes, I think embedded…this is a long-term…you’ve seen embedded and removable, semi-removable, the lower end that doesn’t need a lot of storage, you can’t afford a lot of storage…embedded or multi-chip packages, MCP, and multimedia applications, audio and video I believe will gravitate to removable or semi-removable cards as we get to 1, 2, and 4 gigabytes cards. In the embedded space, we don’t think we have much to offer, in MCP, so we’re not in that market. We’re not in the 1 NAND, but I-NAND is primarily targeted to higher densities and system solution that’s very easy to integrate including onboard security.
Unknown Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Lori Barker Padon, Investor Relations: We have time for one more question.
Operator: We will take our final question from the site of Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht, please go ahead.
Daniel Amir, WR Hambrecht: Thanks a lot. Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question on the USB market, Eli, I think you commented that you guys have been gaining marketshare and kind of how do you believe the 2006 will play out as basically you start to ramp up the whole U3 platform for your USB drives in the second half of the year?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Hi Daniel, yeah, the USB, in particular the U3 market is one of the most spreading markets. It is the most competitive markets, in terms of pricing it is the most aggressive, but also the one that provides the greatest ability to differentiate and segment the markets. We as well as N-Systems, our partners have viewed the U3 platform as having absolutely enormous potential very, very early on. It is taking it’s time to develop. This is normal to all new platforms, but we are very pleased with the overall progress as far as developers, and I expect the majority of our USB products will be U3 enabled. Every meeting that I attend with our marketing people, the ideas that are being developed are just really very exciting.
Daniel Amir, WR Hambrecht: And will this command better margins or same margins?
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Better margins, maybe better marketshare. You get better margins in my opinion by having a lower cost and better distribution and more efficient operations. It’s very, very important to segment the market and to build your margins, but you got to provide better value for the same cost, for the same price or for the same value lower price if you want to be a major player. Consumer electronics is all about value to the consumer and this is our religion.
Daniel Amir, WR Hambrecht: Okay, thanks a lot.
Dr. Eli Harari, Founder, President, and CEO: Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. As you can see, we’re pretty excited about the opportunities ahead of us and we look forward to seeing you all in the coming meetings and investor conferences. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. At this time, I’d like to thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect, and have a great day.

As the number one worldwide market leader for portable consumer storage solutions we are inspired and energized to continue growing SanDisk® in the coming years. We have relentless focus on the large scale of the opportunities ahead of us. And we believe that it is good as 2005 was for us, our fundamentals in 2006 are even better due to our investments in 2005 and the expanding market opportunities that are opening up for us in 2006. Our remarks will address our Business Outlook in 2006. Judy remarks will provide you our fourth quarter results and guidance. And on February 23, we will have our Annual Analyst meeting, which will be webcast and we will provide more details on our Market, Technology, IP and Business strategies. Removable comps storage for handsets is roughly becoming one of our most important new markets. We are pleased with our strong penetration as the Top 10 Handset OEM as well as with the major mobile network operators worldwide. In the past three quarters, our sales of mobile cards increased from 3 million units in Q2 to over 5 million units in Q3 to approximately 11 million units in fourth quarter. Mobile card bundles and Handset OEMs have completely reinvigorated our OEM business and are reminiscent of our best period from the Digital Camera OEM bundling days. In the fourth quarter the star performers in the mobile card line up were the MicroSD which since it’s adoption by SD association has seen rapid gains over all other mobile card formats as well as Memory Stick PRO Duo™ which has been successful due to the popularity of Walkman Handset product line from Sony Ericsson. We expect to see continuing strong growth in our handset business in 2006 and beyond. We are also particularly pleased with our fourth quarter sales of MP3 players in the US retail market, despite a hugely competitive landscape against well known brand names, we have clear Number Two market share in the US. This market has become one of the largest applications for NAND flash memory and our MP3 revenues more than quadrupled from the prior quarter. As for other emerging flash markets, the January Consumer Electronic Show we gave a real sense of the phenomenal possibilities for flash storage. Motorola were showing radio cell phone with song recording capability, FM Radio showed their satellite radio with MP3 recording, playback, the Xbox 360 with Flash drive, BREW GPS systems was shown with maps and flash cards and SanDisk® showed the cool new 6 Gigabyte Sansa™ e 200 with color display, audio, video, FM radio, subscription services, and removable MicroSD card and removable rechargeable battery. In 2006, we intend to capitalize on the growing consumer awareness of the SanDisk® brand through increasing significantly our investment in building and commodity globally with SanDisk® brand. We did new market driving new demand, let’s move now to Industry Supply. Early in 2005, it was widely expected that regard NAND would materialize in the second half of 2005. Which turned out, of course not to be the case primarily because of the huge demand of Flash memory in audio players as well as accelerated consumption of flash memory in handset, portable gaming none of which was fully anticipated by anyone including ourselves. This new demand was to a large extent propelled by the steep decline in the cost and hence the price of NAND Flash and more specifically towards the lower cost of NAND/MLC which made it possible for flash to achieve the crossover point needed to display it’s Microdrives in audio player. In 2005, Toshiba® and SanDisk® executed exceptionally well the 70 nanometer transition on 200 mm wafers as well as the 300 mm production ramp in Fab3. Today we are leading in high volume production of the 8 gigabit NAND/MLC chip. Fab3 is ramping production at a rapid rate and has already achieved the cost crossover point with the 200 mm production, one quarter ahead of our guidance from just three months ago. In the fourth quarter, our shipments of 70 nanometer bits and 300 mm bits were inline with our guidance. In the first quarter, Q1, we expect 70 nanometer bit to comprise more than 50% of our total collective output as our collective output itself continues to grow. In Q1 2006, we will also begin converting Fab3 capacity from 90 nanometer MLC to 70 nanometer MLC. We expect these steps will give up a steep cost reduction curve that will allow us to continue to be highly cost competitive in 2006. We try to continue to investing aggressively in 2006 in R&D for 55 nanometer and 45 nanometer NAND MLC, in controller technology and in accelerating the technology roadmap of the 3D memory technology that which we acquired with Matrix Semiconductor. We regards to Fab3 capacity expansion we are evaluating with our partner Toshiba®, timing for capacity addition beyond 48,751 wafers per month which we had previously discussed. It is reasonable to assume that the progress to ramp Fab3 to it’s maximum capacity and we will update you in due course of additional CapEx requirements to support our 50% share of these Fab3 capacity investments. Additionally due to the significant lead times associated with planning, building and ramping new advanced NAND Fab, we have started the process of evaluating with Toshiba®, our combined demand for additional NAND capacity in 2008 and beyond. Toshiba® are discussing Fab expansion options and considering timing and other requirement for a possible new advance NAND Fab beyond Fab3. We see substantial new capacity coming upstream from our sales and competition in 2006. And we believe it will be largely matched by growth in demand in the markets that we have discussed. We are excited that the number of large scale engines for growth. Although in 2005 we have shown it is difficult to ultimately gauge the rate of growth in any particular market or in any specific quarter. At the same time, it is importance that we take proactive steps to stimulate consumer preferences to move to higher capacity. Accordingly, we have initiated key strategic price move of approximately 25% to 30% early in this quarter to make 2006 ‘Year of the Gigabyte’. European and pricing actions have already taken place and in early February similar pricing moves would be instituted in America. These strategic pricing actions are similar those we did in 2004, which were extremely beneficial in stimulating electricity in 2004 and 2005. Consumers typically have responded favorably to such pricing moves with a 52 to 90 day alive. On the IP front we expect 2006 to be the busy year as we continue to aggressively protect and grow our IP portfolio. At the end of 2005 we had more than 500 US private spending mostly relating to advancement NAND/MLC as well as second generation cost storage solution and systems. In addition we are extremely pleased with the portfolio of 124 issued CapEx and 140 patent applications, which we acquired with Matrix. These patents represent we believe key fundamental elements of three dimensional semiconductor memory of arrays and as such have proportionately immense value in future years. Current semiconductor memories including NAND and NOR flash are manufactured in two dimensional arrays and may sometimes it next decade become prohibitively difficult to scale. When that happens Matrix’s 3D technology patents could be the foundation for future semiconductor storage in the post modern era. In summary the fourth quarter was a very strong finish to a great 2005 and we anticipate 2006 to be a year of continuing strong growth and revenues, profits and market share. Judy.
Judy Bruner CFO Principal Account Officer and Executive Vice President of Administration: Thank you Eli and good afternoon everyone. There is no question in that 2005 was a fantastic year for SanDisk®, for all of 2005 revenue grew 30% and net income grew 45%. Our ASP per megabyte declined 52% leading to the emergence and growth of new applications for NAND flash. Our megabyte sold increased 166% and this growth could have been higher if we had more supply. We were able to reduce cost at a rate faster than the decline in ASP leading to expansion of our gross margin and operating margin. Our full year operating margin was a record 25% and the consistency of our operating model was notable with Q4 2005 representing the 13th consecutive quarter of operating margins above 20%. Our fourth quarter product revenue was up 35% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. Megabyte sold grew 49% sequentially at the high end of our previous forecast and ASP per megabyte declined 13% slightly less than we had previously anticipated in part due to the modest growth in average capacities and a strong mix of digital audio players which carry a slight in higher price per megabyte. As is typical in the fourth quarter sequential growth was strongest in the retail channel where our revenue was up 31% over the third quarter. Our OEM revenue grew a robust 22% sequentially based on the strength of handset business. Handsets have now displaced Digital Still Cameras as the mainstay of our OEM business, with cards for handset accounting for 76% of our fourth quarter OEM revenue. For the fourth quarter the OEM channel contributed 23% of our product revenue up from 19% in the year ago quarter. On a geographic basis our product revenue mix in Q4 was 54% Americas, 24% Europe and 22% other international regions. License and royalty revenue of $67 million was inline with our previous estimate and up 63% year-over-year and 12% sequentially for the full year our license and royalty revenue increased 37% to $239 million. Our revenue by end market continued to diversify in 2005. Revenue from the handset market increased from 6% of our total revenue in 2004 to 13 % of our total revenue in 2005. Revenue from the digital audio market grew from 1% of total revenue in 2004 to 6% in 2005. Gaming revenue grew from essentially nothing in 2004 to 3% in 2005 and our revenue from the digital camera market moved from 65% of our total revenue in 2004 to approximately 52% in 2005. Product gross margin in Q4 of 34.4% was up 2.4 point on a year-over-year basis and down 2.8 sequentially as we had expected. The key variables contributing to this sequential gross margin reduction included one, our ASP for megabyte came down 13% in Q4 compared to the very moderate 5% in Q3. Second we began generating in revenue in Q4 from product built in Q3 with early production 300 mm 90 nanometer wafers which carried a higher cost structure than the high yielding 200 mm 90 nanometer wafers from which we had build the product generated revenue in Q3. Third we had a strong mix of MP3 products in Q4 and MP3 products carry a lower than average gross margin percent due to a higher mix of non memory components in the built up material. And finally on the positive side our non-captive mix came down from 39% in Q3 to 35% in Q4 providing a favorable impact on Q4. For the full year our non-captive mix was approximately 35% the same level as 2004. For all of 2005 our product gross margin was 35.5% an impressive increase over 2004 is 31.9% gross margin. Operating expenses for Q4 of a 104 million grew a modest 5% sequentially. The growth was concentrated in sales in marketing driven by holiday branding and merchandising costs as well as variable marketing and commission cost tied to higher volume. Our GNA costs were down sequentially primarily due to lower legal cost. For the full year our operating expenses were 17.2% of revenue toward the higher end of the our 5% to 18% target financial model due to Fab3 R&D startup cost in the first half of the year. Operating income for Q4 was a record $198 million up 57% year-over-year with an operating margin of 26.4% compare to 23% in Q4 of last year. Our full year operating margin of 25% is particularly impressive given the startup cost associated with ramping in Fab3. Other income of $14 million increased by $2 million from the prior quarter due to higher interest rates on our cash investments as well as higher cash balances. Our effective tax rate remained at 37% resulting in record quarterly net income of $134 million and record quarterly EPS of $0.68. Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with just under $1.7 billion of cash in short term investments. For the full year our cash investments balance grew by $375 million and the business generated cash from operations of $481 million. During 2005 we invested $134 million in capital equipment primarily for back end assembly and tests and for R&D. We invested $56 million in Flash Vision and Flash Partners, which was quite bit less than we had anticipated due to the timing of payments by the joint ventures and as a result of prioritizing usage of attractively price operating leases to fund Fab3 equipment. At the end of the year our guarantee of operating leases stood at approximately $203 million for Flash Partners and approximately $75 million for Flash Vision. In December Flash Partners closed a second trance of operating lease financing which is expected to contribute approximately $150 million to SanDisk® funding obligations for Fab3 expansion in the first half of 2006. During the fourth quarter we invested $22 million in Flash Partners and we also invested $54 million in SanDisk® capital equipment. Again primarily for backend of assembly and test. Accounts receivable increased $118 million seasonally from the previous quarter with the dollar growth all related to sales volume and DSO stood at 44 days at the end of the year. Inventory grew by $45 million due to a successfully steep ramp in FAB33 wafers sold out across the quarter. Channel inventories stood at a normal level between 7 and 8 weeks at the end of the quarter. I’ll now turn to our outlook for Q1 in 2006. Let me remind you that the forward looking comments that I am about to make are subject to risk and uncertainties as described at the beginning of this call, and in our periodic SEC filings, and we do not intend to update these comments or forecast prior to our next quarterly conference call. Given our acquisition at Matrix on January 13, I will provide some guidance to help you incorporate the impact of this acquisition on our 2006 numbers. However, in future quarters the Matrix business will not be a recording unit, and we will not segregate it’s results. In addition to the acquisition of Matrix another change for 2006 is the inclusion of stock compensation. I will talk about the gross margin and operating expenses without stock compensation and without charges related to acquisition purchase accounting. I will also give you some estimates of the impact of these new items. Beginning in Q1 2006, we plan to provide the GAAP results and non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP result will exclude stock compensation and charges for amortization of purchase intangibles and in-process R&D. In accordance with SEC regulations we have posted to our website at www.sandisk.com in the investor relations section a summery of the GAAP and non-GAAP guidance comments I’m about to make. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005 we saw average capacities in retail increase in total by only 12%. In order to move the market to give you by capacities and stimulate further growth of new application, we are making significant price moves in Q1. We expect our ASP per megabyte to decline approximately 25% to 30% in the first quarter. With these price moves beginning to stimulate the retail market in the second half of Q1 and with the strength of our mobile OEM business, we expect megabyte sold to range from approximately the same as Q4 to up to 10% above the Q4 level, rather than decline seasonally as with the case in last years Q1. By continuing the ramp of Fab3 throughout 2006, we expect megabyte sold to increase between 180% and 190% in 2006, compared to 166% in the 2005, and 167% in 2004. We except our ASP per megabyte to decline 50% to 55% in 2006, very similar to the 52% in 2005. Our 2006 revenue expectation for our new Matrix business is $60 million to $90 million, the same range we estimated in October. We expect Q1 license and royalty revenue between $78 million and $83 million and full year license and royalty revenue of approximately $350 million representing approximately 45% growth for 2006. This licenses and royalty revenue forecast incorporates the latest data publicly disclosed by our licensee. We expect product gross margin percentage to decline in Q1, due to our price moves being greater than the cost reduction that will be recognized in the first quarter. Generally there is about a quarter lag between when product is build and when the product sells through retail. Therefore the cost of product sold in the first quarter is largely based on our cost structures in the fourth quarter of 2005. As we move in to Q2 and Q3, we expect to recognize cost reduction at a faster rate than the anticipated price declines in both quarters. We expect non-captive mix to be between 30% and 35% for Q1 with the reduction in the non-captive mix to 25% to 30% in subsequent quarters given the increase in Fab3 supply. Excluding stock compensation and purchase intangible amortization, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin for Q1 to be 30% to 32% and for all of 2006 to be 32% to 35%. This compares to 35.5% in 2005, and 31.9% in 2004. On a GAAP basis including stock compensation and purchase intangible amortization both of which are beginning in 2006, we expect product gross margin to be approximately 1 point lower than the outlook ranges I have just provided. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 of approximately $125 million excluding the impact of stock compensation intangible and amortization and in-process R&D. The increase in expenses from Q4 to Q1 includes approximately $10 million for Matrix operating expenses. We also planned to increase NAND related R&D spending including spending on 55 nanometer development. And in addition we expect sales and marketing expense to increase sequentially in order to expand international distribution and develop branding campaigns that we believe will be important to our market position and growth in 2006 and beyond. Legal expenses are also forecasted to be higher in Q1 2006 and in Q4 2005. For 2006 we expect non GAAP operating expenses without stock compensation in acquisition related purchase accounting charges to be 17% to 18% of revenue, towards the higher end of our targeted financial model of 15% to18%. Primarily because of the added expenses related to the Matrix business, without the acquisition of Matrix our planned spending would have been near the middle of our target financial model range. Stock compensation is estimated to increase our 2006 operating expenses by approximately $100 million. The Matrix acquisition will result in a Q1 one time charge for in-process R&D and an on going charge for amortization and purchased intangible that will include developed core technology and customer relationship and amortization of deferred compensation. Because the acquisition just closed on January 13th we do not yet have a final evaluation analysis and purchase allocation, however preliminary estimates are that the Q1 one time in-process R&D charge will be between $30 and $50 million and the 2006 intangible amortization is estimated to be between $15 and $25 million spread evenly across the quarter. Excluding stock compensation and acquisition purchase accounting, we expect our non GAAP operating margins to be in the middle to the high end of our target financial model of 20% to 24%. As a result of changes in the mix of our profits around the world, we are forecasting non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2006 of 35% before the impact of stock compensation and acquisition related purchase accounting charges. This compares to our 37% tax rate in 2005 and reflects a true savings in our worldwide tax rate. On a GAAP basis however the tax rate will be higher because the accounting rules do not allow a tax benefit to be taken on the compensation expense related to divesting of qualified incentive stock options nor on the charge for in-process R&D. Our estimated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2006 is 37% however it will be higher than this in the first quarter because in-process R&D is a discreet item that is not tax effective. After the first quarter the GAAP tax rate will be less from the estimated annual 37% but could still vary by quarter, based on the timing of this qualifying disposition of incentive stock options. As you forecast shares for next year remember that we issued approximately 3.7 million shares in the Matrix acquisition and we assumed equity incentives that could result in approximately 0.6 million additional share. We expect to make investments in or loans to Flash Partners in 2006 of approximately $400 to $500 million and we also expect to increase our guarantee of operating leases by atleast the similar amount. We will provide further Fab joint venture investments details at our analyst day in February. We expect internal capital spending unrelated to our Fab joint ventures of approximately 200 million in 2006, primarily related to backend assembly and test in R&D. We expect inventory levels to continue to grow across 2006 due to the continuing ramp in Fab3 and our expected revenue growth. In summery 2005 was in excellent year for Sandisk® and as we look to 2006 we expect our Fab3 investments and our product innovations to generate strong growth in our business. We will now open the call for your questions.

Q - Gurinder Kalra: Thanks. I have a couple of questions, looks like your MP3 players are pretty strong in Q4. Do you know, what seasonality might dictate in terms of their share of the overall, in Q1 and how sort of, share of various applications and products might go from Q4 to Q1?
A- Eli Harari: Yes we expect very strong seasonality with MP3 players. So, Q4 for the two players is absolutely is turning to be gorilla quarrel. We expect a significantly lower units and dollar revenues from MP3 players in Q1.
Q - Gurinder Kalra: And what you think, it's going to make up that flat in terms of application segments?
A- Eli Harari: We have already pointed out that Handsets are very very significant market and we expect that, as well as the fact that we have, now a very larger, really a number of markets as all contribute. The Ultra Product line for example, U3 product line and we are going to launch a number of very sexy products towards the end of Q1 that we showed at the CES Show, the Sansa™ e200 will be launched in March. The new U3 cruisers would be a launching also. There is whole number of products across different markets. So we certainly are not dependent on just MP3 markets to drive our Q1 revenue.
Q - Gurinder Kalra: Great, my second question is related to the licensing and royalty side. Can you provide us an update on beating the front as to, what, I guess, events might unfold over the next quarter which could impact your licensing revenue needs either the way or what events might unfold in the next six months?
A- Eli Harari: We’ve already pointed out in my prepared remarks that there is tremendous amount of activity going on. In the SD situation there are suits and counter suits and continuations and IPC actions and that is not the only thing. So there is lot of things going on and we are very very aggressively pursuing new entrance that we feel and existing players that we feel should take the license to our pattern.
Q - Gurinder Kalra: Thank you.

Q - Jim Cavallo: Hi Good Evening. A couple of core questions. How are you going to gauge, if and when your elasticity is working in the market place. What kind of things you are going to look to, what kind of things can we look to, when should we expect that to see if the price cut is kicking in the kind of elasticity that you would need to soak up the incremental supply, and then I have a couple of follow up. Thanks.
A- Eli Harari: The main metric for that would be the Megabyte per unit, that we ship in retail, that’s the first place, when people start moving their preference from 512 Megabyte to Gigabyte. We are now – to achieve 600055 Megabyte per retail, average Megabyte per unit that means you are closer to the 512 Megabyte to the Gigabyte. As the cost of the Gigabyte cards comes down quite significantly, we do expect that people will start switching that and that will be first place to where you will see that. But it is not so much, the first reaction is not so much, increase in units because that requires new applications that increase Megabytes per unit.
Q - Jim Cavallo: Great, first follow-up with the, on inventory, what do you expect inventory to do in calendar Q1?
A - Judy Bruner: We would expect inventory to continue to grow in Q1 given continued steep ramp for Fab3 across the first quarter.
Q - Jim Cavallo: Okay and then my final question, I understand that demand drivers, we all do about how great the demand drivers are for NAND flash. Do you worried all about how many of the  DRAM companies seem to be start moving, seem to be moving incremental capacity from DRAM over to NAND and obviously at some price. NAND can observe all this incremental supply, did you worry about the impact that is going to have on pricing as you move throughout the year if the DRAM companies continue to be so aggressive in that migration, that’s it from me, thanks.
A- Eli Harari: Yeah, this is complex answer ofcourse, and I am sure you know it, but basically it is really, two aspects of that. Definitely we are worried about our new suppliers getting new capacity switch from DRAM to NAND flash. That part of the second aspect which is that, the output that you get from the 300 mm 70 nanometer MLC wafer is so dramatically greater. Then what do you do from switching from 90 nanometer DRAM wafer to 90 nanometer Binary NAND or even 70 nanometer Binary NAND on 200 mm wafer. Most of the DRAM capacity today in the world is 8 inch. And the conversion of 8 inch DRAM wafers to NAND at 90 nanometer is not going to see a bit significant crunching in terms of, the contributor over the numbers, total numbers of Megabytes added for the industry, really very very substantial. In other words, we are getting to very large numbers now. And we think that DRAM conversion, that’s was the easy task DRAM guys, is going to become spend swing and basically at that point we move to 300 mm and leading edge NAND MLC.
Q - Jim Cavallo: Thank you very much
A- Eli Harari: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Edelstone with Morgan & Stanley.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Hi Good Afternoon guys. Thanks for the data, I had one question, you have might got it but Judy had missed it, what was the contribution from MP3 players in the fourth quarter?
A - Judy Bruner: We didn’t provide for the fourth quarter. We provided it for the year and I said that the revenue from Digital Audio Players moved from 6% of our revenue in 2004 to 13% for 2005.
A- Eli Harari: And we did say that revenues in Q4 quadrupled, Modem quadrupled the revenues from MP3 players in the prior quarter which was very very steep increase. I think, it is definitely was one of our better players. No comment on that. And as far as your comment about all of this information that Judy due to provide, I do not, I would not wish with you guys, I would not want wish to be a financial analyst, with all these GAAP and Non-GAAP-.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Just multiply it by about 30 more companies?
A- Eli Harari: Yeah that’s what, I can just imagine this is unbelievable, anyway, that is what we got to do.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Okay, thanks for the clarification there. I guess, my question is, Eli, is looking at the Sansa™ players that you brought out, showed at CES certainly seems like those are going to be well received in the market. So, what if you kind of give us your views as to what you think the potential there could be when you look at the fourth quarter of this year and I got a couple of quick follow-up.
A - Eli Harari: Yes, so session that we had for the e200 Sansa™ has been universally very very positive and we are very excited about it. But our strategy, as we said, in MP3 players is to basically offer good, better and best. The e200 is best and we will serve very very well in that part of the market for customers that want and high end, high quality products but also want an open, way to get the content through subscription services from Napster, Real Networks, home music and so on. But we are also pretty much focused on the midst to low density MP3 players under 4995 to the 1995 for instance. We think that is going to be, where we can move a lot of Megabytes and the lot of units during the year. However the e200 is a very exciting product for sure. And again in long end, we do think that Handsets would be the primary comrade for distribution of music. Just by the shear numbers, we are talking 11 million cards in the fourth quarter compared to, this is very very large number, compared to all iPods 14 million iPods sold in the quarter, you see that we are and we haven’t really touched the surface with handsets.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Okay, thanks. Judy, an accounting question. I just want to make sure my understanding is correct here, with the price reductions that you are taking and with 7 to 8 weeks of channel inventories. It seems like that should line up every things goes according to your plan that you should be able to end the quarter without having a take any type of charges for price protection, is that correct?
A - Judy Bruner: Well remember that because we recognize revenue in the retail channel based sell through, at the time we recognize the revenue we know what price the product is being sold to the consumer at. So the pricing and the impact of the price protection lines up with sell through. And if you look at our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter there is a line for deffered income from sales to the retail channel, that number includes our estimated impact of the price protection which we accrued the end of the fourth quarter for all of the known price moves across all the geographies in the first quarter.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Okay, is that the major factor as to why it is down quarter-to-quarter then?
A - Judy Bruner: Yeah.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Okay, then just last question, Eli, can you just walk us through what the current Fab3 ramp plan looks like as you go to 2006?
A- Eli Harari: We were certainly ahead of our plan in the fourth quarter, the ramp in the fourth quarter was substantially faster than we had guided you or that we thought was possible, it is really tremendously strong execution and we are definitely on schedule to meet the guidance that we gave you that by the end of Q1 we will be at 30,000 wafer hours and we’re certainly not come on top of that point. We will try to provide some more guidance on that at the Analysts Conference but in general this Fab is performing extremely well and we’re pleased with the cost structure as the number of wafers increases at a very fast pace the fixed cost does not increase at the same pace and as now cost are coming down at a very fast pace. As we expect, basically through the rest of the year continuing through the cost reduction that would be quite significant every quarter aid through increasing the volume, amortizing the cost, fixed cost over greater volume leads to the yield improvement and sees through the transition to 70 nanometer MLC.
Q - Mark Edelstone: What where the output for Q4 Eli?
A- Eli Harari: We’ve not broken that, but the contributor to the inventory as, the high inventory at the end of Q4 is because this is very rapid ramp every week basically and increase in the output.
Q - Mark Edelstone: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice-President of Administration & CFO: Okay, if we could limit the questions to one or two for each of the analysts that would be great that way we could answer everybody else, thanks so much.
Operator: And our next questions will come from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC World Markets.
Q - Daniel Gelbtuch: Hey guys! Congratulations. I was wondering if you guys have seen Samsungs (indiscernible) clearly do you think there some of efforts with MLC, have you seen any product in the market and also what do you expect to see on the pricing for your non-captive sourcing. Are you expecting to see similar price reductions over the course of the quarter?
A- Eli Harari: We are shipping some of the MLC in some of our products, and we’ve said all along that we want to be one of the primary customers NAND/MLC because, like to pages called. But it is well known that they have been and in fact their own on numbers indicate that there have been somewhat ramping after the MLC had lower pace than projected from the beginning of 2005. As far as price reduction non-captive, I argue upon and absolutely, I mean they have, we fully expect overtime competition will match our pricing, but this move is primarily to really stimulate new demand also suffice that, the new capacity coming on board does not become excess capacity.
Q - Daniel Gelbtuch: Okay and just switching gears one second to U3, can you comment and what your expectations are for your volumes, your percentage of volumes for USB drives how will be U3, how much will not by the end of the year.
A - Eli Harari: We expect majority if not all of our Cruiser USB flash drives to the U3 enabled for the rest of year, definitely we are moving in the right direction in both parts of the NAND systems. I think I am pretty confident about the direction we are taking, very, very pleased about U3.
Q - Daniel Gelbtuch: Thank you very much.
A - Eli Harari: Thank you Daniel.
Operator: We’ll now go to Eric Gomberg, Thomas Weisel Partners
Q - -Eric Gomberg: Congratulations on the strong 2005.
A - Eli Harari: Thank you.
Q - -Eric Gomberg: Obviously you had some additional momentum on the wireless side, I was wondering if you could discuss a little about the visibility there, what type of bundling and after market growth you’d expect to be and I have a follow-up.
A - Eli Harari: Oh. We have the great deal of visibility on the handset, you are talking about the handset. Right okay some people when they say wireless they mean WiFi. We are working with all major handset makers and we are very, very pleased with the adoption of MicroSD and Memory Stick™ for Dual, the demand in the fourth quarter, we could have shipped more, frankly we could sold significantly more than 11 million units and we were frankly constrained backend capacity of assembly, and by the way that now is behind us. We do have ample backend assembly and test capacity to meet the demand and the demand is kind of Bimodal, the low capacity 64 megabyte for general purpose maybe the camera phones and the 512 megabyte primarily for the MP3 phones.
Q - Eric Gomberg: Okay, just have a question also now on margins, a quick one for Judy, as far as the past, should we expect faster growth of R&D or SG&A. The question is also on gross margins for the year, you said I think 32 to 35 on product gross margin. Just wondering you said more captive than external last year that you should be able to cost reduce faster then your own ASP declines. So wondering why product gross margins would be down from 35.5 of 2005.
A - Judy Bruner: Okay so let me take that one first and then I’ll go back to your question about G&A versus R&D. So really the overall gross margin for the year is impacted by our forecast for a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 but then we expect as I said the cost reduction that we will enjoy in the middle part of the year could be at a faster rate then the so subsequent price declines and subsequent quarters. So we work our way back up but leading to an average overall range of 32% to 35%. Which you know if were at the high end could be very close to 2005, and even at the lower end is better than my experienced in 2004. But also keep in mind the mix of the products and as our mp3 players are becoming a bigger mix of our overall revenue, as I indicated those two carriers somewhat lower gross margin percentage eventhough they are contributing significant gross margin dollars given the higher non memory components within the build-up material mix. And as to your first question you asked whether R&D would grow which will grow faster R&D or G&A and generally I would say R&D in particular given the R&D team that we have picked up now for Matrix as well as our investments in 55 nanometer and 45 nanometer throughout 2006.
Q - Eric Gomberg : Okay Thank you.
Operator: And our next question come Satya Chillara with American Technology Research
Q - Satya Chillara: Yeah! Hi guys. I know you would talk about greater visibility into cellphones can you talk about well before that Judy said 13% of the revenues come from handset in 2005. Can you give us some sort of insight into what would that be by the end of 2006 whatever that revenue might be?
A - Eli Harari: We will try to provide more information at the Analyst Conference at February 23rd but certainly we expect it to be on the rapid growth path and it will certainly higher than 13%. I mean I’d be surprised if it is lower than that.
Q - Satya Chillara: Okay in terms or maybe can you answer the question which regions are you seeing the MP3 phones really taking up based on the OEM activity that you’re seeing, where do you get all this demand coming from?
A - Eli Harari: We had been shipping really only to the US in any substantial number of MP3 players. Almost exclusively through really two of our main retail customers, so the room for expansion is very, very substantial opportunity to leverage our channels through other chains as well as geographically outside of the United States. We believe a very substantial and primarily so at a low and mid end price range not at the high end.
Q.-.Satya Chillara: Okay. One last question for Judy. Judy what is the plan for captive to non-captive in 2006 with the 300 mm expansion and so on. Are there is any changes in the plan in terms of captive to non-captive mix.
A - Judy Bruner: I had indicated in my prepared remarks that we expect 30% to 35% in the first quarter and then to move into the 25% to 30% range in subsequent quarters.
Q - Satya Chillara: So based on that margin should improve right? So why are you still conservative in terms of 32 to 35 kind of gross margin.
A - Judy Bruner: Well as I indicated a while ago, mix is an impact and we of course will see how things roll out over the course of the year.
Q - Satya Chillara: Okay, this model really does give us the tremendous possibility that we’ve always said a very, very importantly 2005 was clearly was supply constraint with captive and we market out really on non-captive in 2006 the situation maybe a flipped and that is the beauty of our model.
Q - Satya Chillara: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we will go now to Craig Ellis of Citigroup.
Q - Craig Ellis: Yeah! Thanks and congratulation on the reduction ramp on the fourth quarter.
A - Eli Harari: Thank you.
Q - Craig Ellis: Some clarification on the inventory for the fourth quarter did the backend in terms of any tightness bearing on the inventory dollars between the backend assembly.
A - Judy Bruner: No not really as Eli indicated a minute ago by the end of the fourth quarter we really did not have any backend assembly or test bottlenecks. We cleared those issues.
Q - Craig Ellis: Okay, then Eli back in October you talked about 50% price for Megabit declined, right now maybe a little bit have you added 50% to 55%. If you think about how you could manage that both strategically and tactically. If you got a supply you could press that pick up share by increasing price not only in the first or the second quarter. Can you show your thinking about how you might use that price for Megabit declined?.
A - Eli Harari: Well, the most important thing for us is to focus on our cost reduction to make sure that, we reduce our cost faster and we would reduce our megabyte. Secondly, there is no point leaving money on the table and driving pricing faster than we can actually supply the market. So, we will, you could also frankly, view the strategy of basically linear price reduction throughout the year, it’s a kind of like, the most demanding environment but, it’s really, is not as effective in our experience in generating stimulation, simulative effect. So, we will definitely use our cost advantage to drive the demand to our benefit, to our advantage, to make sure that 100% of our output, captive output is very sound world wide.
Q - Craig Ellis: Okay. That sounds like, something that looks more like 2004 than gradual price declines?
A - Eli Harari: No, we’ll take it one quarter at a time, we’ll see how it goes.
Q - Craig Ellis: Okay, all right, and then lastly, any update on what you are seeing with regards to iNAND™ in design and switch backlog.
A - Eli Harari: iNAND™ we announced September, it is about 3 ½ months ago, we are seeing initially a good response, we expected be a winner in Handset, it has not just very very easy designing and very attractive cost structure but also the security cost/security, but it will be most in the second half of the year in terms of our volume reduction and it will be a relatively small contributor still in 2006.
Q - Craig Ellis: Okay, Judy, one more, I think, I heard you say, bit growth of a 180% to 190%, is that correct?
A – Judy Bruner: Correct.
Q - Craig Ellis: And that assumes the 25% to 30% non-captive resourcing?
A – Judy Bruner: Correct.
Q - Craig Ellis: Okay.
Operator: Our next question from Sam Doctor with J.P.Morgan.
Q - Sam Doctor: Thank you. A couple of good questions for you. Mostly of the questions have been answered but you have an update on the pre packaged media on SC cards?
A - Eli Harari: I am sorry, under what?
Q - Sam Doctor: Prepackage media grew by cards and do you think the distribution of content?
A - Eli Harari: Okay, it’s a groupwise. The concept again, great concept and has been a tremendous door opener for us, promoting the record labels, that component owners, and by distance again, it’s a long term market development evangelizing and this is a very very good start. So, we are very very pleased with that.
Q - Sam Doctor: Okay. And on the Matrix acquisition, what was the kind of applications do you expect to see in 2006 what is driving revenue for this year?
A - Eli Harari: 2006 the revenues are really driven by growing their business which is preprogrammed cards primarily for video game application, software distribution, games and music and the key for us is to get them on accelerated technology roadmap and develop a much broader customer base in the application to technology, the archival technology is very, very interesting you know frankly very exciting, and we will talk some more about that again on February 23rd.
Q - Sam Doctor: Ok great thank you.
A - Eli Harari: Thank you.
Judy Bruner, Executive Vice-President of Administration & CFO: Looks like we might have more time for two more callers, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Oppenheimer
Q - Vijay Rakesh: Yeah, I was just wondering when you look out at the Q1, so you are looking at about flat to about up 10% bit growth, what the price as you mentioned is that across, is that blended ASPs or?
A - Judy Bruner: Yes for blended decline in ASP per megabyte of 25% to 30 %.
Q - Vijay Rakesh: Okay, and can you characterize what the MLC output was in the quarter. And what do you expect that in the quarter?
A - Eli Harari: MLC on 70 nanometer is 100% MLC we don’t make any Binary on 90 nanometer, its mostly MLC, over 90 % of MLC.
Q - Vijay Rakesh: And your 8 Gig, what percentage was it Q4 and where do you see Q1?
A - Eli Harari: On the 70 nanometer, all of Q4 opt for 8 gigabit, but we are now rolling out the chat version, the 40 gigabit lower than -?
Q- Vijay Rakesh: Okay great. Thanks
A - Eli Harari: Thank you.
Operator: And our final question today will come from Doug Rudisch with Brookside Capital.
Q – Doug Rudisch: Hi just a question on MicroSD the cell phone cards, just can you review sort of the price premium you’ve been able to extract on that form factor, if any and if you’ll be able to hold it over time.
A - Eli Harari: No we are not extracting any premium from MicroSD we are selling it in the same priced OEMs as we do a MiniSD or SD for that matter, we are developing the markets, we’re not trying to extract a premium, our cost on the MicroSD is, I believe about the same to MiniSD. We don’t want to use pricing to get customers to decide MicroSD is ideal for all the new generation of ultra slim handsets that’s really the only way, frankly that they can get a decent sized card in a very very small form factor if you take the connecter into consideration.
Q - Doug Rudisch: And your market share there’s wide and how you expect that to evolve over the course of the year?
A - Eli Harari: We have made MicroSD an industry standard, we want other people to supply it, we would like to have the lion share of the supply but we think its very important that there are other supplies, we expect to collect royalties, substantial royalties as MicroSD become very popular and the other suppliers that take license from the SD association we share in the royalty that’s generated from that.
Q - Doug Rudisch: Any analytic view of where your market shares now and where you will think it will go over the course of the year?
A - Eli Harari: I am sorry, say it again
Q - Doug Rudisch: Any quantitative view of where you your market share is now in that form factor and where it will go in the course of the year?
A - Eli Harari: MicroSD to the extent we have very, very high market share in the, I don’t know if its 80% or - but it is somewhere along there we don’t expect to keep that for long time and we have probably have lost some market share because of our inability in the fourth quarter to meet our customers demand and you know, we would like to be the majority supplier of MicroSD going forward.
Q - Doug Rudisch: Thank you very much.
A - Eli Harari: Thank you, So I would like to thank you for attending SanDisk® today we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us and look forward to meeting many of you during our up coming Analyst Day February 23rd,thank you very much.
