Bob Cardin will then review our financial results and capital allocation, after which Ward will provide closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Before discussing our Q1 results, I'll take a moment to discuss our previously announced Chief Financial Officer transition. On April 10, we announced Jim Nickolas' departure as CFO to move his family back to their beloved hometown of Chicago. We're grateful to Jim for his nearly eight years of service to Martin Marietta, over which time he made meaningful contributions to our success. We wish him and his family the best in their next chapter. In partnership with a leading executive search firm, we've initiated a process to identify our company's next CFO and are considering both internal and external candidates. While the search is underway, we're pleased Bob Cardin will serve as our Interim CFO. Since joining Martin Marietta in 2019, Bob has been an integral member of our executive and finance teams. We're grateful he's willing to assume this role in addition to his responsibilities as Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and are confident that under Bob's leadership, will not miss a beat during this transition period. Now turning to our financial results. I'm pleased to report this year is off to a strong start, highlighted by record first quarter aggregate revenues, gross profit, gross margin and gross profit per ton despite some challenging winter weather in January and February across key Southeast, Southwest and Midwest markets. This record-setting performance was driven by 7% pricing growth, disciplined cost control and margin-accretive acquisitions. Additionally, building upon its full year 2024 performance, Magnesia Specialties established new quarterly record revenues, gross profit and gross margin, with gross margin increasing 806 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. These results demonstrate why we have consistently said this business has earned the right to grow, and we'll continue to evaluate both organic and inorganic opportunities to do so. We also established several consolidated first quarter records, including consolidated gross profit of $335 million, a 23% increase; consolidated gross margin of 25%, an increase of 300 basis points; consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $351 million, a 21% increase and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%, an increase of 274 basis points. These results underscore the resiliency of our differentiated business model and benefits of our 2024 portfolio optimization actions. Given current macro uncertainty, we continue to focus on matters within our control, most notably realizing fair value for our vital materials while appropriately managing our costs with product demand. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by the double-digit growth in organic March aggregate shipments, April daily shipment trends and realization of April 1 aggregate price increases in select markets, all of which provide us confidence in reaffirming our full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.25 billion at the midpoint. Consistent with our past practice, the company will revisit its guidance at midyear. Moving to end market trends. We'll start with observations regarding infrastructure, which continues to benefit from robust federal and state investments, including the five-year Infrastructure and Investments and Jobs Act, or IIJA. As a result, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, or ARPA, expects construction activity to grow in 2025 as work advances on projects supported by federal and state funding sources. Importantly, with only about one-third of the IIJA funds reimbursed to states through the end of February 2025, we expect IIJA spending will peak next year in 2026, followed by an extended tail thereafter as further described on Page 8 in today's supplemental information. While contract award growth rates have moderated as reflected in the value of contract awards for the 12-month period ended February 28, 2025, the underlying baseline remains elevated. Funding certainty reinforced at both federal and state levels provides the impetus for steady product volume levels and underpins a strong pricing environment for years ahead in this countercyclical public end market. Importantly, too, Congressional priorities now appear to be increasingly shifting toward the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs with key legislative discussions already underway. Early indications suggest the successor bill may emphasize projects with national or regional significance favoring roads, bridges and ports. Shifting to nonresidential construction, artificial intelligence, or AI, continues to drive strong demand for data centers across the United States as hyperscalers invest significant capital in new sites. Projects underway in our geographic footprint, including Stargate in Texas, Google in South Carolina and Meta's 4 million square foot facility in Louisiana underscore this momentum. While not yet a meaningful contributor to product shipments, we expect data center energy consumption requirements will drive ancillary demand for new aggregates-intensive power generation facilities across many of our key markets. Warehouse construction appears to have reached a cyclical bottom with more green shoots emerging, including large Amazon warehouse projects in Cleburne, Texas; Fort Myers, Florida; and Wilmington, North Carolina, to name a few. With respect to residential activity, affordability challenges continue to act as a natural governor on single-family housing starts. We don't expect this dynamic to resolve in the near term, absent either a modest home price contraction, lower mortgage rates or both. That said, long-term housing market fundamentals remain resilient, underpinned by demographic shifts and structurally underbuilt conditions in many of Martin Marietta's key Sunbelt markets. In summary, we anticipate demand for infrastructure in our public end markets and data centers in the nonresidential sector will remain robust, while portions of interest rate-sensitive private construction demand is expected to remain subdued in the near term. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to discuss our first quarter financial results. Bob?
Robert Cardin: Thank you, Ward, and good morning everyone. The Building Materials business posted revenues of $1.3 billion, an 8% increase. Gross profit increased 20% to $298 million, and gross margin improved by 229 basis points to nearly 24%, both first quarter records. As Ward mentioned, our aggregates business achieved record first quarter revenues, gross profit, gross margin and unit profitability of $1 billion, $297 million, 30% and $7.60 per ton, respectively. Notably, aggregates gross profit per ton improved over 16% and aggregates gross margin expanded 260 basis points as organic price cost improvement and the benefit of margin accretive acquisitions more than offset headwinds from targeted inventory management efforts. As mentioned in our previous earnings call, we will continue to prudently manage our inventory levels. That said, we expect these inventory drawdown headwinds on gross margin will conclude by midyear as we began reducing inventory levels in the third quarter of last year. Cement and Concrete revenues decreased 12% to $233 million due to the threefold impact of the February 2024 divestiture of the South Texas cement plant and related concrete operations, winter weather this past February and slower residential demand. Gross profit decreased 23% to $24 million as the year-over-year gross profit improvement in cement was more than offset by a decline in ready-mix concrete gross profit due to higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving revenues grew 37% to $80 million due to increased asphalt shipments in California. This business posted a $23 million gross loss due to customary winter shutdowns in Minnesota, consistent with typical first quarter seasonality trends as well as higher raw material costs in Colorado. Magnesia Specialties achieved all-time quarterly records for revenues, gross profit and gross margin of $87 million, $38 million and 44% respectively, driven by pricing improvement and continued cost discipline. Turning now to capital deployment. Martin Marietta's capital allocation priorities remain consistent and focused on prioritizing value-enhancing acquisitions, responsible reinvestment in the business and returning capital to shareholders. Relative to the latter, during the quarter, we repurchased nearly 911,000 shares at an average share price of $494 and paid $49 million of dividends. Since Martin Marietta's repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our $1.3 billion of total liquidity, free cash flow generation and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x as of March 31 provide ample balance sheet flexibility to capitalize on our active M&A pipeline. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our strong first quarter financial results and remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead in 2025. The foundational strengths in our resilient aggregates-led business, strong balance sheet, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and proven experience successfully navigating market cycles reinforce our confidence in delivering our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. Longer term, in 2026 and beyond, we remain confident that Martin Marietta is exceptionally well positioned for sustainable growth and compelling value creation. To conclude these prepared remarks, I'll briefly touch on tariffs. Tariffs present both opportunities and challenges. Some enhance profitability, while others may increase certain input costs or impact product demand. However, it's worth noting that our company's supply chain is largely domestic. That said, given the uncertainty surrounding potential exemptions and retaliatory measures, our 2025 guidance neither assumes any material tariff-related tailwinds nor headwinds at this time. If the operator will provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question today. Thanks for the color that you gave in the prepared commentary and going to the earnings season broadly. We at TRG has been focused on talking to a wide range of construction value chain companies. And there certainly seem to be some that are doing better versus others in the heavy materials generally. Seem to be doing better, but it's still early days with the tariff debate that is ongoing. Against that backdrop, what gives you confidence with the volume guidance and maintaining it? And pulling the string a little bit further, we are seeing some green shoots of stabilization in certain end markets like distribution that previously had been weak. What are you seeing there? And are you seeing any projects canceled or delayed? Or any other upside that you're seeing, as you said, in the infrastructure market? Thanks so much.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, good morning. Thank you for the question. Several things. One, I do believe heavy side materials in these types of circumstances fare better than most. And I think that's exactly what we're seeing. I think we've long been a safe haven for investors. I think we'll continue to be. If we're looking at the trends that I think are worth noting, Infrastructure, as we noted, is going to be good for the rest of this year. Infrastructure ought to be good going into next year as well. We talked about the fact that only 30-some percent of the state reimbursements have even occurred so far with IIJA. So there's lots of money to come in that. And the state DOTs in which we're doing business, if we look at our top 10 states, eight of the top 10 have budgets up year-over-year. Infrastructure is strong. It's going to remain strong. Equally, and you called it out, data centers and what's going to be coming behind data centers, will be at the moment. We're seeing that in a host of markets. As you know, they are terribly power generative. And as a consequence, we think we're going to see good energy activity in those markets as well. But the other thing that I called out in the prepared remarks and you noted is warehousing, we believe has found a bottom. And the fact is we have the largest Amazon project in North America underway right now just outside the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. We're seeing good activity on the West Coast of Florida. We're seeing good activity in that respect on the coastal areas of North Carolina as well. But separate and distinct from that, if we're looking at customer backlogs right now, they're nicely up year-over-year and sequentially. So that's looking at work. It's also looking at prospective work. But here's what's important, too, because I think this is something that's really important. We're not seeing project cancellations. So the backlogs are building, projects are not being canceled. And so those three building blocks, I think, Kathryn, really give us a nice outlook for the year. The other thing that I think is important for us to remember is we really got washed out last year in Q2, particularly in the Southwest and in Dallas-Fort Worth, which is our largest single MSA market. So as we're looking at volume and we look at the trends in Q1, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the daily trends that we're seeing in April right now, all of that points to me to a very steady and attractive and appealing volume environment for heavy side building materials, particularly in the aggregate space. So Catherine, thank you. I hope that helps.
Kathryn Thompson: It does. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Howard. Good morning, Bob.
Howard Nye: Hi, Trey. Good morning.
Robert Cardin: Good morning.
Trey Grooms: So I did want to touch on the cement business. I mean it's fairly small part of the overall business now. But if you look at the margins there in the segment, it looks like ready-mix, the headwinds there more than offset the improvement you may have seen in the cement margins. So how are you thinking about margins in that segment as we progress through the year, especially with any additional increases in cement pricing that we could see going forward? And then to that point, the Texas market is clearly an importer of cement. How do you think the tariff backdrop could play into that and potentially into the pricing outlook for your cement business? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Trey, thank you for the question. I'd say several things. One, if we're looking just at cement, I mean, pricing was up 6% and profits and gross margin actually grew despite the fact that we had lower production volume in cement. So when we're looking at that business, it performed really well despite what was a pretty tough February simply because of the weather. The other thing that's worth noting is FM7 has obviously finished. It's operating well. Obviously, pricing growth in cement is moderating. That's totally as expected from the rates that we've seen in the past couple of years, but we expect good mid-single digit growth this year. And again, to that end, pricing was up 6% in Q1. If we're looking at ready-mix, I mean, ready-mix, several things were driving that portion of the business in Q1. Some of it was simply seasonality. And the other is, if we're looking at organic shipments, they were down 2% to prior year, and that's really due to continued softness largely driven by residential demand and degrees of weather headwind as well. The other thing that's happening there is in our downstream businesses, we're taking the increased aggregates and cement cost impacts as well. So keep in mind, that really ends up being a distribution chain for us more than anything else. Now relative to your question on Texas cement and tariffs, it's interesting, because I think that actually could provide some upside for us because that's going to further insulate Midlothian cement from the waterborne imports. And frankly, as I just think about tariffs generally for our business, I know I said in the prepared remarks that we're neither putting in a headwind nor a tailwind. If I really think about them, it's really in two different buckets, Trey, what happens from a revenue perspective and what happens from a cost perspective. And if I'm thinking about it from a revenue perspective, frankly, it's pretty helpful to aggregates because you end up passing the cost through. We talked about cement. The fact is in Magnesia Specialties, depending on what happens with steel production, the more steel production we see, the more dolomitic lime that's going to go out the gates as well. And of course, much of this is driven to drive more reshoring and manufacturing demand across the United States generally, which will help us specifically. And again, as I noted, our supply chain is largely domestic. So we really don't see a notable threat there. But I do think relative to tariffs and the essence of your question that was around cement, I don't see that there's any downside for us in that respect whatsoever, Trey. So again, I hope that's responsive.
Trey Grooms: Yep. Super helpful, Howard. Thank you and best of luck.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.
Howard Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Robert Cardin: Good morning.
Jerry Revich: Howard, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about Magnesia Specialty has earned the right to grow organically and via M&A. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is the first time I recall you saying that. Can you just expand on what value-added M&A would look like in this line of business where you folks had value in ag is very clear? What's that recipe for value ag if we see you move down that main trail for Magnesia Specialty?
Howard Nye: Jerry, I appreciate the question. So first, let's begin with the baseline. If we look at that business, number one, it's always been a very good, steady performer for us. If we look at the recent years, the work that they've done on pricing actions, operational reliability and efficiency efforts are really coming together, and you just saw a very attractive story for the quarter. And we actually think that business has more upside than downside right now. The reason that we think that business has the right -- earned the right to grow is it's got many of the same attributes that aggregates does. It's got very high barriers to entry. It's got pricing power through cycles. This is a business that has been through what we feel like is probably the single most challenging chemical marketplace that we've seen in my career, and it's a business that continues to put in record quarters. If you think back to the financial crisis. And by the way, I don't think we're anywhere near that. But if you think about the financial crisis, Martin Marietta always remained profitable. We never cut or suspended the dividend. And one of the big reasons why was we had that differentiated portion of our business that was Magnesia Specialties. So to the extent that we can take that portion of our business and grow it responsibly, it's something that we will certainly look at. Obviously, we're going to continue to be an aggregates-led business. But when we look at our business and we recognize that is truly a differentiator for us, it's something that, number one, I think they've earned the right to be called out on because they're really good at it. And number two, to the extent that we can continue to invest organically and invest inorganically, we should. And I believe our shareholders would richly benefit from that.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Howard Nye: Jerry, thank you. Good to hear your voice.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Philip Ng: Hey guys, congrats on the strong quarter. Howard, I mean, you sounded uber bullish on infrastructure, which is great. With the new administration, certainly a lot of head stakes in terms of projects being paused and what's formula based and whatnot? So one, help educate us what you're seeing out there? And then two, you kind of hinted that as we kind of look out to 2026, maybe we get a new Surface Transportation Act. There was some news the other day with Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman, Sam Graves, potentially pushing for a new source of funding for the Highway Trust Fund, which is the first on EV and hybrids. Wanted to get your thoughts on that opportunity and what that could mean for you guys?
Howard Nye: Phil, thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, in true heavy side construction that we're looking at the traditional highway funding, we haven't seen any projects pulled. We've seen some of the grant projects pulled. And again, those -- that's an entirely different animal and a very small portion of overall infrastructure. So that's been nothing that has caused us any concern. Again, if we're looking at really what we're tracking right now, several things, you've seen the data that I've seen as well, and that is if we're looking at highway contract awards and we're looking at LTM from March of '23 to March of '25, they're up 19%. So number one, that's a great number. Number two, if we're looking at the cumulative state reimbursements, I mentioned this before, $118 billion has gone out of the $350 billion that's really been set aside for highways and bridge funds. So as a practical matter, only 34% of the total funds have found their way out into commerce at this point in time. But if we also go back in time and say, how does this usually play out, that ticks and ties back into my commentary both on '25 and '26. So we're going to see a nice continued build over the next couple of years. And again, if you look at the slide, I guess, the slide -- forget which slide it is, particularly in the supplemental material, but it takes you through the ARPA snapshot of what these '25, '26 and '27 will look like. And then it shows the out years, but importantly, the out years are not showing what we anticipate will be an attractive successor bill. Now to your point, the successor bill is already gaining some degree of dialogue in both the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as EPW. And I'm seeing a couple of things. One, they are talking increasingly about projects of regional and national scope. So look, I think there's going to be less about bicycle trails and a lot more about highways, bridges, roads and streets. I mean I think that's code for what that means. But importantly, too, and this goes to the gravity of your question, Sam Graves, as you mentioned, Republican from Missouri, who heads House T&I, opened a dialogue here this week that needed to be opened. And that is he's looking at what are we going to do with EVs? What are we going to do with hybrid vehicles? And how are they going to be in a position that they're helping pay for infrastructure when they're wearing out infrastructure just as much as the gasoline cars and in some respects, more because these vehicles tend to be really heavy. So actually, what we're seeing is the revenue package put forward would begin, from my perspective, a much overdue conversation and bring some fresh ideas to a problem that's long been avoided. And the issue is simply this. The gas tax and the diesel tax were never indexed for inflation. And if we go back and look at what's happened or more to the point, not happened there since Bill Clinton's first term in office, it has remained utterly static. So as a consequence, we've been having to go to the general fund for years. And if you look over the last 17 years, it's been to the tune of about $275 billion. Now do I think we're going to have to look to the general fund going forward? Yes, probably so. But do we need to have multiple drivers, no pun intended, that are putting funds into that Highway Trust Fund. The answer is that we do. And that's what the states have been doing very effectively. I think the fact that now we're having that conversation at a national level is important, and it's a really good start.
Philip Ng: Okay. Appreciate the color.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Tyler Brown: Hey, good morning.
Howard Nye: Hi, Taylor.
Robert Cardin: Hi, Taylor.
Tyler Brown: Hey, Bob, actually, cost performance was very solid in aggregates. I know that there is some discussion with the peer that maybe some maintenance or stripping costs got pushed out on the weather. One, I guess I'm just curious if you saw the same thing. And two, can you just help us shape how we should think about cost inflation for the rest of the year? I know you lapped the inventory pressures midyear. And are you kind of looking at double-digit gross profit per ton each quarter? Appreciate it.
Robert Cardin: Yes. Thanks for the question. So in the first quarter, I would say that we saw just excellent cost management by our operations teams. In light of the inventory reduction, the team was very proactive. So if you look at energy and contract services on a per unit basis, they were down low-double digits. Supplies and repairs kind of down in the mid-single digit range, again, on a per unit basis. So overall, I think just effective management. We do have a diesel fuel tailwind that's helping us as well. The other thing I'll mention is if you back out the impact of the $0.72 per ton impact from the inventory drawdown, we were actually down 2.3% on a unit cost basis. So as we look forward, we expect in the future quarters that we will see continued healthy expansion in gross margin.
Q –: Perfect, yes. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Angel Castillo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, congrats on a strong quarter here. Just maybe wanted to unpack a little bit more along the lines of that kind of 2Q and 3Q, but maybe more from a price perspective. So you had some of your pricing maybe get pushed out to April. So just curious, how should we think about the progression of price growth as we get into 2Q? And as part of that, could you talk about midyears, what you're seeing in terms of any pushback from perhaps those customers that have shifted out to April or anybody else perhaps pushing back on midyears?
Howard Nye: Angel, good morning. Thank you for the question. So several things. One, if we look at the pricing as reported, up 6.8%. So that was a nice steady growth. Keep in mind, we do have some April increases that are going in as well. So that's primarily to certain select concrete customers. I think this is important, Angel, if we're looking at our organic business, the pricing was up about 7.4%. So actually, you saw a pretty healthy delta between as reported cumulatively and the organic business. That tells me several things. One, we continue to have some room ahead of us relative to the assets that we have bought to get them up to Martin Marietta pricing. I think that also tells us that they're going to be midyears in a number of markets. And keep in mind, the guide that we have given you does not assume any midyear price increases, and we're going to see degrees of midyear price increases. I think the other thing to keep in mind just from an optical perspective. During the first quarter, in particular, the Central division operations because they tend to be more northern climate are not operating and not selling as much. Those will now start coming on and into play more meaningfully, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. Their average selling prices tend to be modestly lower. Now all that said, really, as I'm looking at the ranges that we've given for pricing, at this point, I'm thinking we're probably going to be on the higher end of ASPs relative to the guide that we've given. And obviously, we'll come back and review the overall guide at half year as is our custom. But I think if you think about pricing in Q1, strong. If you think about pricing relative to the organic business, particularly strong. If you think about the price increases that we believe can be coming relative to the acquisitions, they look actually quite good. And I think I've given you a sense of how I think that's going to play out for the full year, Angel. So I hope that was responsive to your question.
Angel Castillo: Absolutely. Very helpful. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Yes, take care, Angel.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Howard Nye: Hi, Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: Hey, Ward, you referenced, I think historically bad weather that you saw in North Texas in 2Q last year. Is there way to think about -- or can you remind us sort of what the impact of that was? Or if there's sort of an add back we can think about? I'm just trying to kind of circle back on this. You saw such strong gross profit per ton growth in 1Q. Just wondering what that could look like in 2Q given some of the puts and takes?
Howard Nye: Well, look, I think it will look attractive in Q2. Again, I'd have to go back and pull out exactly what the hit was last year in Q2 because of the weather in North Texas. But it was notable, Anthony. And I know I spoke to it last year very specifically. We can go back and maybe take offline what that was. But again, I think we should see a nice sequential build throughout this year. And keep in mind, the other thing that will happen by the time we're done with Q2 is the inventory headwinds that we're working our way through will have been totally dealt with. As Bob mentioned in his comments a few minutes ago, if we're simply looking at this quarter, the inventory headwind was $28 million. And we had indicated coming into the year that we thought it would be somewhere between $20 million and $30 million a quarter in both quarter 1 and quarter 2. So do I think quarter 2 ought to be more attractive simply because we don't anticipate something that's epic in North Texas in the quarter? Yes, I think we probably do. Do I think you've got a nice build also into quarter 3 because suddenly, you don't have that real headwind from what we're going through right now relative to the inventories. So Anthony, I hope that helps.
Anthony Pettinari: Yes, that is very helpful. I will turn it over.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Anthony.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: Hi, good morning guys.
Howard Nye: Hi, Timna. Good morning.
Timna Tanners: Ward, could you help us notice the really strong share buyback in the quarter, bigger than all of last year. It might just be a question of just authorizing, but I didn't see a reauthorization to keep that level going forward. And just wanted any thoughts on the amount? Was it opportunistic because of where the share price is? Is it a commentary on a lull in M&A? Any more color would be great. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Timna, thank you for the question. It was not a commentary on M&A because I continue to think that's going to be attractive for us this year. It was really more of a commentary that look, we like where the share price was, and we thought that was a great place to go in and buy. So we bought 911,000 shares, and that was $450 million because we thought it was opportunistic and a good buy. So -- and if you recall, actually when we bought TXI in 2014, 2015, we had an authorization at that point to buy back 20 million shares. And if we look at where we are in that, we bought back about half of that over that period of time. So we still have plenty of runway ahead of us. Importantly, if you look at where we finished the quarter relative to a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we're still very much in the range that we like to be. And obviously, we're about to hit the time of year where we really start making considerable money as well. So no, it's not a commentary on a lack of M&A pipeline because, in fact, that actually looks quite good. It is a commentary on the fact that we thought that was an attractive entry place for the stock, and we proverbially put our money where our mouth is. So thank you for the question, though, Timna.
Timna Tanners: Thanks, Ward.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Fisher: Thanks, good morning. So back in February, you had characterized the guidance as being sort of conservative guidance. And I'm curious how you feel about that today? Is there any conservatism you think you needed to draw on in Q1 or the first four months of the year or that you see in Q2? And I know you just said a couple of questions ago that the guidance does include -- does not include the midyear. So I'm just curious how you'd kind of characterize the outlook today, also in light of things have kind of changed a little bit in the macro backdrop.
Howard Nye: Thank you for the question. They have changed a little bit in the macro backdrop. But what I'll say is this, you're right. I forget whether we used the word measured or conservative coming out of -- coming into the year. But I think it was one of the other, and they're probably synonymous. Where I'm sitting today, I actually feel better today than I felt in February. So to the extent that we felt like it was a measured guide at the time, I probably feel that same way, maybe a little bit more strongly today than I did then. Obviously, we -- as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we come back and we'll revisit our guide at half year, which we typically do. I've already indicated, I think our pricing is going to be at the higher end of that. So obviously, more to come. But there's been nothing that I'm seeing in the way this year is playing out and the way that our teams are responding, whether it's relative to cost, whether it's relative to pricing, whether it's relative to what we're looking at from M&A, that has been a disappointment to me. I think our teams are performing well. And again, I think the business is revealing the type of durability that I would expect it to, particularly given the significant portfolio shaping that we brought to the business last year. Seeing these nice margin enhancements are not a surprise to us. It is a nice affirmation on where the business is, and I think it gives you a good sense of where the business is going.
Steven Fisher: Perfect, thank you.
Howard Nye: You're most welcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, Jacklyn, Bob, Ward.
Howard Nye: Hi, good morning. Mike, we're having a hard time hearing if you can speak up just a little bit, please.
Michael Dudas: Can you hear me now?
Howard Nye: Much better. Thank you so much.
Michael Dudas: Great. Terrific. Following up on Timna's question, turning to acquisitions. Has the macro environment looking at the sentiment amongst your acquisition pipeline changed materially? Have things been maybe pushed off a little bit because of the uncertainty? And what take your temperature on where you feel like you've transformed portfolio quite a bit in the last 18 months? Are we at similar types of levels given where the cash flows are going to be in your balance sheet and the opportunities ahead of you given there's going to be some pretty reasonably sized assets may be coming on the market?
Howard Nye: Great questions. And I would say several things. One, I don't see material changes in the sentiment on businesses that are looking to do M&A today. I think it feels broadly the same. As we've discussed before, typically, people aren't selling businesses because they're trying to time it in our space. They're typically doing it relative to family succession and other issues that drive M&A. So we haven't seen that as a significant issue for us. As I've also indicated before, I think we're in a place that, give and take, normal year is going to be around $1 billion worth of M&A. But don't expect that to be linear. There are going to be years that it's likely going to be notably more than that. And again, I think in some respects, M&A can be a little bit like the buybacks that we did this year. It can have a head of opportunism that comes with it because if some businesses come along that are particularly compelling businesses, you'll see us lean in and be smart and sensible about a business because you're frankly not going to see it come through again. So am I seeing anything that I would view as a material change? No. Do I think it will continue to be an attractive year for us on aggregates-led M&A? Yes. And do I think that's likely to be the case, not for a matter of quarters, but really for a matter of years and likely through this next so 2030 period. I think the answer is undeniably yes, because when I'm looking at simply closely held aggregate businesses in markets in which we want to grow, we've identified businesses that produce and sell, let's call it, 250 million tons of stone per annum right now, which tells us there's effectively a business out there that's modestly larger than Martin Marietta is today that would be in something that we would think of as our sweet spot. So I think there's -- there's a lot that's been done on shaping. There's a lot that's going to be done over the next several years and decades in growing this business and continuing to shape it and doing it in ways that hopefully, you will continue to see more profitability, but you'll see continued margin expansion and the quality of the business continue to grow.
Michael Dudas: That is a lot of rock out there, Ward. Good luck.
Howard Nye: Thanks so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: And congrats on the good quarter, Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, David.
David MacGregor: Just wanted to -- yes, I wanted to just take your temperature, I guess, this is an M&A question of sorts, but it would relate to just any changes you're seeing in the permitting prospects out there in the permitting process that would improve your ability to increase reserves oriented acquisitions?
Howard Nye: Yes, it's interesting, David. I don't see that changing notably, and I would say several reasons why. Obviously, there is a certain degree of aggressiveness relative to the regulatory state that's underway with the current administration. And frankly, I welcome that. The fact is the regulatory state that drives what's happening relative to permitting greenfields, adding reserves, et cetera, tends not to be a national issue. It tends to be a local issue. So is it a national issue relative to an air quality permit? Yes, it sort of kind of is. Is it a national issue relative to water quality and discharge? Yes, it sort of kind of is. But the bigger issues aren't those. The bigger issues are zoning and the bigger issues are land use relative to either conditional use permitting or special use permitting. And those tend to be decidedly local. And when I say local, I don't mean at the state level, I mean at the city level or the county level. And the fact that those barriers to entry are notable, I think, is important. It also plays to the strength that we have relative to land use. Part of what you'll see us do, and you can see it in some of the CapEx numbers, is we will buy properties adjacent to our existing operations and recognize that we can go through a special use and a zoning process on those parcels that at times can take years. And that's okay because we typically have long-lived reserves. But when we get those adjacent reserves zoned and permitted, two things happen. One, the setbacks that we have on our existing quarries basically go away. And then we also have opened up to us the new reserves that we just bought. So the fact is we end up winning twice under those circumstances. So do I think it's changing relative to greenfielding? No, I don't. I think it's going to continue to be a challenge in many instances. Do I think it's changing relative to next door? No, I don't. And do I think there's opportunity at the national level to change that? Actually, I really don't because this ends up being a highly local issue. And it's an area in which Martin Marietta has long had I think a very capable resource, and we've done that well. So I hope that helps, David.
David MacGregor: Yes it does. Thanks, Howard. Good luck.
Howard Nye: Take care. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Howard Nye: Good morning.
Brent Thielman: Appreciate the detail. Appreciate all the color around the federal funding visibility here. That's really great. I think the other side of the question that we seem to get is on the state side. I mean, as you sort of scrutinize some of your largest states on the public infrastructure side and the mechanisms for funding infrastructure projects, I'd just be curious what's your assessment, your experience as to whether there's risk of reallocation within those state budgets away from transportation funding, especially if the economy begins to see a shortfall in tax revenue.
Howard Nye: Brent, thank you so much for the question. So I would say several things. One, if we're looking at Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Arizona, Iowa, as I indicated before in my comments, our top 10 states, eight of them are seeing budgets year-over-year that are up. And that's particularly true if we're looking at their baseline budget. I think more importantly, if we go and look at some of the information on those individual states themselves and really think about that, I mean, if we're looking at the 2025 approved increasing for Texas long-term 10-year program, it's already up 4% to $104 billion. And if we look at how that translates, if we're looking at our March '25 aggregates backlog for customers in that state, they're up about 18%. So again, these state budgets matter. If we're looking at Colorado, they expect to have about $3.7 billion available to spend in FY '25. That's a nice increase over what we've seen in recent years. Equally, in North Carolina, their budget has increased year-over-year. But importantly, and this goes back to the question I had before relative to federal budgets. In North Carolina did something that was important, and they started taking sales tax revenue and shifting that to the highway fund. And beginning in 2025, that goes up to 6% here in the state. And if we're even stepping back and looking at what has to be done, you recall, obviously, Hurricane Helene came through, created a lot of mayhem in the western part of the state. And we're seeing nearly $5 billion worth of work that has to be done there. $3 billion of it will come from the federal government, $2 billion from the state and North Carolina has a $6 billion rainy-day fund. Part of the reason I call all of this out when we began our SAR process in 2009 and 2010. We were looking to do business in states that had a very, very strong fiscal condition because we believe that was going to be important as state populations continue to grow, and we wanted to be in states that had the capacity to continue to grow what they're seeing from a DOT perspective. Again, that's what we're seeing in Georgia as well. They've got a 7% increase this year from their original 2024 FY budget -- FY '24 budget. So I think if we look at the federal side that you mentioned and then go to the state side that you specifically asked about, eight of the top 10 are up. And then if you take even within a subset of those 10 and start looking at precisely what we're seeing, it's a very healthy storage.
Brent Thielman: Very good. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Nice quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: When you talk about data centers and the associated power demand word, are those projects. Are you thinking about those as a driver in 2025? Or is that more 2026-plus.
Howard Nye: I think that's more 2026 plus. So I think in the near term, you're going to see more activity on data centers, and I think that's going to be pretty significant. I think in the near term, you'll see growing activity on warehousing. I think in the medium to longer term, you're going to see more energy activity. I mean, for example, we've got local power companies talking about small nuclear facilities for the first time in years. And the fact is we're going to have to see a number of those types of things. It's been interesting to watch what's happened in Europe this week relative to Spain, Portugal and other countries. And I do think the United States is going to have to be really thoughtful about the way that we're going to continue to grow in light non-res. And we're going to continue to see population shifts and dynamics to the Southeast and Southwest. And these states, in particular, are going to have to be ready for that type of power transition.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Howard, I want to go back to your comment on potential new legislation. Is there any kind of timeline emerging when that would only be introduced in Congress and potentially push down the law?
Howard Nye: There hasn't been anything formal, Keith, that's come out, but I'll tell you anecdotally what I'm hearing, and that is I think there's going to be a push to get that done before the midterms next year. I think there are practical reasons that people are going to want to see that done. I think the other thing that it does is it makes the takeoff for the next bill much smoother. I would not be surprised to see a headline bill that's less than $1.2 trillion, but I'd be really surprised to see within that bill, the same geography that we saw this last time, $1.2 trillion bill that had $350 billion dedicated to Highways Bridges, Roads and streets. That's not the way I think this is going to come out. So I think we're going to see several things. One, I think what you've seen in House T&I this week relative to funding is a good part of an overall conversation. We'll probably see House T&I take the lead on putting this out. That's the way that historically has worked. So they've taken the lead. EPW has followed, but I still think it's going to be something that we will see done before midterms, Keith.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Is the talk in the -- I'm not sure a lot of this in trade routes something greater for roads, bridges, streets, something greater than the $348 billion that we saw in IIJA.
Howard Nye: I think that's certainly where people are trending, yes, Keith.
Keith Hughes: All right. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you so much.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just follow-up on the comment you made that you feel better now on the outlook than you did after 4Q. I wanted to kind of specifically drill down on the volume piece. Given the concern on private construction with affordability and consumer confidence issues, is it fair to assume the outlook had a lot of discussion on infrastructure, but is it fair to assume that your outlook for infrastructure this year may be directionally stronger than it was coming out of the fourth quarter?
Howard Nye: Yes, Garik. I think that's entirely fair. I mean if we think about it, Q1, if I look at the breakdown that we had, 33% was infrastructure, 36% was non-res, 24% was res. Look, I think going forward, we're clearly going to see that 33% get bigger, and I think we should. Given the quantum of projects that are out there, given their relative aggregates intensity, that number should move. That to me is a seasonally driven number. At the same time, I think people would be surprised that the 36% was non-res. So the fact is we go to the point that the heavy side of that is actually doing pretty well. The light side of it, frankly, in some areas are doing better than people would have thought. And at this point, Look, we're not putting a lot of stock in what happens on residential all by itself. The thing that I think is worth noting, though, is residential, at least in our markets, is so far from being overbuilt, it's really almost ridiculous. If we're looking at what builders are focused on right now, they are focused on -- and this goes back to part of the question that David MacGregor asked. Builders are finding that it's taking more time to get zoning and special use permitting for subdivisions. So their notion of buying land and then getting entitlements in place is important. We think they're focused on that. I continue to believe, look, don't put a lot of money on housing on the second half or this year. But we will see that come. It's not going to take a lot of movement relative to interest rates or home prices to have it move pretty notably in our markets. And the fact is we're well positioned to meet that whenever it does show up.
Garik Shmois: Good. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: And my apologies. Now our final question is from Brian Brophy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Andrew Maser: This is Andrew Maser on for Brian. I just had a quick one on pricing opportunities for prior M&A. I believe some of the M&A you completed in the past year generally had ASPs below corporate averages. I was wondering where you stand on closing that gap? And then separately, how are you thinking about the potential for mid-year price increases in markets where last year's M&A won't be a tailwind? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you so much, Andrew. I would say several things. As I indicated, organic pricing was up 7.4%. Reported was up 6.8%. That gives you a pretty good snapshot right there on what's the difference between the M&A sites that we've had and the organic that we've had. There are some places, for example, California, where we have now closed that gap. But the fact is, from my perspective, California shouldn't be at a corporate average. Barriers to entry in California are higher. The difficulty in doing business in California is higher. So the fact that we've closed that gap is nice, but it doesn't indicate to me that we finished the journey that we started on there. I do think we will see a number of midyear price increases, as I indicated before. I think the quantum will probably look a bit like it did last year. More to come on that. We'll talk more about that when we're together at half year. But directionally, I hope that gives you a sense of where we are and where I think we're going.
Andrew Maser: Great. Thank you.
Howard Nye: You're welcome.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Howard Nye for closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Abby, thank you, and thank you all for joining today's earnings call. While the unpredictability of policy shifts heightens broader economic uncertainty, we remain confident about Martin Marietta's ability to appropriately navigate these conditions. Since 2010, we've transformed the durability of our portfolio and positioned our business in attractive markets through disciplined execution of our store plans. We built a strong foundation to continue extending Martin Marietta's long track record of delivering sustainable growth and superior value creation for investors for years to come. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2025 results in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Again, thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin.
Jacklyn Rooker: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Over the years, the disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan has significantly transformed our company by providing Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. with a coast-to-coast footprint, with the majority of our products and services going to areas exhibiting the highest growth potential, by demonstrating our ability to manage through uncontrollable circumstances, by adhering to our value over volume approach to meet customers' needs without discounting the value of our own assets, and generating a higher return on those assets and by showing the resiliency of our business model no matter the macroeconomic backdrop. As a result, our business is superbly positioned for near, medium, and long-term success. 2024 was no exception to those themes. We once again delivered record aggregates financial performance and successfully completed nearly $6 billion of portfolio-enhancing transactions. Operationally, our team successfully managed many exogenous factors, including persistent inclement weather, tighter-than-expected monetary policy, and related modest private construction slowdown. The team's steadfast commitment to managing what they could control, namely commercial excellence, cost management, and portfolio optimization, enabled the fourth quarter delivery of record profits, margin expansion, and record cash flow from operations. Before discussing our full-year results and 2025 outlook, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from 2024's fourth quarter. With the weather better cooperating in the fourth quarter, earnings growth and margin expansion resumed, evidenced by our record fourth quarter consolidated gross profit of $489 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $545 million reflecting an increase of 8%, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%, an improvement of 210 basis points. Pricing gains more than offset the impact of inventory management efforts, driving fourth quarter record aggregates gross profit per ton of $7.92, an increase of 12%, and aggregates gross margin of 33%, an improvement of 120 basis points. In addition to our impressive financial results, we successfully completed three aggregates bolt-on acquisitions in Southwest Florida, Southern California, and West Texas, all of which are attractive SOAR-identified geographies. Our full-year results were notable given the year's extreme weather and the difficult macro economy. Aggregates revenues and gross profit both increased 5%. Despite these headwinds, we established new aggregates in Magnesia Specialties records, specifically to $4.5 billion and $1.4 billion respectively. Aggregates gross profit per ton increased over 9% to $7.58. Magnesia Specialties revenues increased 2% to $320 million, and Magnesia Specialties gross profit increased 10% to $107 million. Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s safety and enterprise excellence culture have long underpinned our financial results. I'm pleased to report we achieved our best full-year safety incident rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Notably, this marks our eighth consecutive year of a world-class lost time incident rate and fourth consecutive year of world-class total injury incident rate. 2024 surpassed 2021 as our most active M&A year ever, with nearly $4 billion of aggregate split acquisitions and over $2 billion of non-core asset divestitures. We selectively pruned cyclical and non-strategic cement and ready-mix concrete operations and redeployed the proceeds into pure aggregate assets in attractive markets, adding nearly 1 billion tons of aggregate reserves to our footprint. These proactive portfolio actions created a more durable business, increased the gross profit contribution from our core aggregates product line, enhanced our margin profile, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet for continued acquisitive growth. Looking ahead, expect the reshaped portfolio together with our fourth quarter results, will provide a solid foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. Specifically, our full-year 2025 aggregate shipment guidance of 4% growth at the midpoint assumes that strong infrastructure and data center demand, a full year of 2024 acquisition contributions, and normalized weather patterns will all more than offset the slowdown in private construction, which is primarily interest rate-driven. Our full-year 2025 pricing guidance of 6.5% growth at the midpoint. These revenue drivers combined with moderating cost inflation, Magnesia Specialties, and a full year of contributions from our cement and downstream businesses, while lower than the last three years of double-digit growth, remains notably higher than the long-term industry average of 3% to 4%. 2024 acquisitions underpin our 2025 full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.25 billion at the midpoint, a 9% improvement compared with the prior year. Moving now to end markets. Start with infrastructure, our most aggregates-intensive and often countercyclical end market. Both building and maintaining our nation's heavy infrastructure remains a bipartisan national strategic priority. Three years into the five-year Infrastructure and Investment in Jobs Act or IIJA, nearly 70% of highway and bridge funds remain to be invested, indicating robust multi-year tailwinds. Importantly, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association or ARTBA, public highway, pavement, and street construction is expected to continue to grow, reaching $128.4 billion in 2025 compared with $119.1 billion in 2024, an 8% increase. Notably, based on recent state and government contract awards, ARTBA's 2025 transportation construction market outlook shows Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, key Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. states, are among the largest markets expected to show growth. Moving now to non-residential construction. Artificial intelligence or AI continues to drive unprecedented demand for digital and energy infrastructure, as evidenced by recent announcements from Microsoft and the new administration in Washington. Microsoft expects to invest $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on the construction of data centers that can handle AI workloads, with over half of that spend in the United States. Moreover, the new administration recently announced Stargate, which aims to simplify permitting and significantly boost data center through a massive investment of up to $500 billion. The build-out is already underway, with the data center in Abilene, Texas that Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. is supplying from its December acquisition of R. E. James Grovel Company. Moreover, Dodge Construction Network's warehouse square footage starts for the twelve months ended November 2024 inflected positively for the first time since December 2022, and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. was recently awarded the material supply for two large Amazon warehouse projects in North Texas and Fort Myers, Florida, respectively. Shifting to residential activity, affordability and availability remain key issues impacting single-family demand. Neither is expected to resolve in the near term given the higher for longer interest rate environment. Relative to the availability issue alone, Realtor.com recently estimated that the US housing market is underserved by approximately 7 million homes. That said, when single-family residential construction inevitably rebounds, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s leading positions in key Sunbelt MSAs provide attractive opportunities to capitalize on structurally underbuilt markets with pent-up demand. In summary, record state and federal investments, reshoring, the artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out, and the long-awaited single-family housing recovery should provide multi-year shipment stability and provide a healthy pricing environment for years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our full-year financial results and liquidity. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. The Building Materials business generated full-year 2024 revenues of $6.2 billion, a 4% decrease in gross profit of $1.8 billion, a 6% decrease. The decline in both metrics, which are comparing year-over-year results, is due to the February 2024 divestiture of our South Texas Cement and related concrete businesses, along with shipment declines in all product lines, partially offset by acquisition contributions. Our aggregates product line achieved all-time record revenues, gross profit, gross margin, and unit profitability in 2024. Contributions from acquired operations and strong pricing more than offset lower shipments. Importantly, this was the second consecutive year of margin expansion. In the fourth year in the last six, experiencing a price-cost widening. Over those six years, margins have expanded 870 basis points. In 2024, aggregates gross profit per ton improved 9% to a full-year record of $7.58 per ton. Cement and concrete revenues decreased 29% to $1.1 billion, and gross profit decreased 40% to $260 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations. Cement margins held up nicely, the ready-mix business experienced margin compression from Q2 through year-end due to higher input costs, including aggregates and cement, outpacing pricing growth. Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 2% to $869 million due to slower market demand, gross profit decreased 7% to $101 million due to lower revenues and higher average input costs, partially offset by lower liquid asphalt costs. Magnesia Specialties established all-time records for revenues and gross profit of $320 million and $107 million respectively, as benefits from strong pricing more than offset lower chemical and lime shipments. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. We achieved record fourth-quarter cash flows from operations of $685 million, an increase of 23% compared with the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in working capital and deferred income tax payments due to the Internal Revenue Service providing disaster tax relief for North Carolina businesses affected by hurricanes Debbie and Houlin. Our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prioritizing value-enhancing acquisitions, reinvestment in our business, and returning capital to shareholders. In 2024, we returned $639 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Even with significant M&A activity, we ended the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times, well within our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our strong balance sheet offers ample flexibility to execute our active M&A pipeline and pursue value-enhancing investment opportunities. Finally, I will close my prepared remarks with some views on tariffs. The depth, breadth, and duration of tariffs, as they are currently levied, remain highly uncertain. As a result, our 2025 guidance assumes no impact from tariffs. There are some situations where tariffs might enhance the company's profitability and others which may lower it. The vast majority of our supply chain is sourced from US locations. The company was served well by that during the supply chain shocks of the COVID era and should serve us well going forward. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jim. To conclude, we're proud of our strong fourth-quarter financial results and industry-leading safety performance. Thanks to our team's collective commitment to Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s vision and strategic priorities, we have deliberately built an increasingly resilient, highly productive, coast-to-coast aggregates business, positioned to grow unit profitability through various end-market demand environments. We are enthusiastic about Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s prospects in 2025 and beyond. The fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our differentiated business, proven strategic plan, strong balance sheet with significant opportunities for growth, and long history of successfully managing through economic cycles, provide us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering strong financial, operational, and safety performance. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To raise your hand and join the queue, press star one. If you would like to withdraw that question, again, press star one. For any additional questions, please re-queue. Your first question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms: Thanks, and good morning, Ward and Jim.
Ward Nye: Hi, Trey. How are you?
Trey Grooms: Doing well. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Good. As we look at the 2025 guide, could you walk us through any of the puts and takes around the overall guidance for the year, including your aggregates price and volume outlook?
Ward Nye: I'm happy to, Trey. Thanks for the question. Look, at the outset, I'd say we're taking a pretty measured approach to the guide this year. Look, there's uncertainty relative to monetary policy and whatever the other policy fluctuations may be during the course of the year. Look at the guidance, proves conservative, and frankly, I hope that it is. We can come back and adjust for upside later. Relative to volume in the first instance, obviously, we're looking at low single digits, and that includes, by the way, Trey, a full year of acquisition contributions if you think about what that's going to look like. BWI closed last April, so we'll see that fully in the first quarter. If we're looking at the transactions that we did in West Florida, in Southern California, and Texas, you know, those will clearly be added at quarters one through three. So again, if you're just thinking about the cadence on that. But if we think about end uses right now, I mean, overall, I think we should expect mid to high single digits growth in infrastructure. I think we're probably looking at low single digits at least right now relative to both non-res and res. And if we think about what the builders are under those, look, I do think infrastructure should stay strong. I mean, there's 70% of the dollars from IIJA that are still yet to come in our sector. It's a practical matter that has to roll out in 2025 and 2026. So that should be pretty constructive. The other thing that we're seeing is nice, steady, consistent, and frankly, growing activity relative to data centers. I know there was some concern there was a blip the other week relative to deep seek. We've actually seen most AI and others come back and double down since then. So we think that should be very healthy this year. Frankly, we're not planning for notable residential recovery in 2025 given the higher for longer mortgage rates that we're seeing because we think that will just continue to affect monthly affordability. That said, in some instances, we are seeing that home buyers are simply getting accustomed to this higher interest rate environment. So we're gonna see how that plays out. But here's something that I think is notable, and I've mentioned it in my prepared remarks. I mean, clearly, we're seeing green shoots in warehousing. The Claiborne, Texas facility that we have, the Fort Myers facility that we have are both large jobs. And that's not the type of activity that you would have seen for the majority of last year. So we've been waiting for warehousing to find bottom. We think it has. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is as we go throughout the year, we're gonna start lapping some pretty weather-impacted orders. Last year. I mean, if you think about it, Q2 was really a washout. In our southwest division, particularly in Dallas Fort Worth, which is the company's largest marketplace. And Q3 was a real challenge for us in portions of the east, including the Carolinas, which is a notable marketplace for us as well. So if you think about the way it rolls up, I mean, the gross profit guidance shows double-digit unit profit of what the growth and nice gross margin expansion. It's gonna be driven by pricing and what we think will be moderating inflation. Now relative to price, price is gonna be a little bit different this year as you simply think about the cadence. Because particularly in the cement market, we saw most cement producers rolled their first price increases back to April 1. Which meant as a practical matter, a lot of ready-mix players were looking for that. So what we've seen in our world is most hot mix and others had price increases effective January 1 as you become accustomed to. There are portions of the ready-mix community, in fact, most of it, that are seeing April 1 price increases. So the price increases will be outsized relative to what history has been, Pricing, I'm convinced, is still very solid, will be attractive for the year. But your cadence this year is likely to be a little bit different. So don't expect to see that same degree of pop in Q1 that we've seen in the last several years. You'll start seeing it building. In two and three, etcetera. So I hope that gives you a sense of it. One last thing I'd say is if we think about the estimated carryover effect from last year's pricing, it's about 80 bps coming into the year, Trey. So I try to give you a sense of end markets. I tried to give you a sense of volume. I'll try to give you a sense of pricing. And how I think that's gonna play relative to margin. So I hope that helped.
Trey Grooms: Yep. That's extremely helpful. Thanks for that additional color. But just for some clarity, and correct me if I'm wrong, that pricing in April movement there for aggregates, if I remember, you know, going back historically, that's with the exception last few years, that that's not unusual for the industry. It seems like that was kind of a normal kind of timing that maybe have had kinda shifted a little bit more to January, just more recent years. Is that the right way to think about it?
Ward Nye: That is the right way to think, Trey. I mean, you've been around this industry for a long time, and I have too. And that's the way that has typically worked. So yeah. I don't see anything there that's causing me any angst, but again, if you're looking at it and modeling, as I know you are, I just wanted to make sure that I was giving you and your colleagues the ability to model that with degrees of precision.
Trey Grooms: Yep. Well, that was super helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi. Thank you for taking my question today. Appreciated your the color on the tariff impact in your prepared commentary, but wanted to follow-up on that. In a two-part way. One, just pull the string on what could be impacted from tariffs from your perspective. We certainly had some metals tariffs announced yesterday. But also to what did Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. do to diversify its supply chain in the wake of the first Trump administration and how are you a little bit better prepared today versus, say, 2016? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Kathryn. Thanks for the question. I'll take the last part first and say this. If we go back to the COVID years when really supply chains were a mess, we actually came through that pretty well. I mean, we were having record years during that period of time. And we were not running into supply chain issues largely because, as Jim noted in his prepared remarks, most of our supply chain is domestic. There were some outliers where we had things coming in from overseas. And to your point, we have moved very carefully in the intervening period time to make sure that we can look primarily to domestic production. And I think that served us well before. I think if we see something that's amped up from a tariff perspective, we'll be even better served right now. The second part of your question, you know, what are some of the specifics? Look, obviously, steel is something that we're going to watch. Steel tariffs, very frankly, could be pretty helpful to our Magnesia Specialties business. And we're supplying a lot of that material to domestic steel producers. So if they see steel production ramp up in the United States, that's gonna help us a lot on volume. And if we think about the Magnesia Specialties business, look, they just had a record year. And they had a record year with chemical and steel markets frankly, in pretty low spots. So again, I think tariffs, very selfishly for us on that, could be helpful. Equally, if we think about tariffs potentially on cement, look, we're a domestic cement producer. We're a long way away from water. But again, I think that would be helpful to our North Texas position. By the way, that business continues to perform extraordinarily well. So I think it would just get that business even more upside. Imports or tariffs relative to stone has a twofold effect. Number one, I think it actually adds value to what we're doing with our long-haul network, particularly relative to rail. So keep in mind, we're shipping more stone by rail than anybody else in the United States. About 30 million tons a year. It's going into coastal areas, principally of the United States. We think that could be helpful. To be perfectly transparent about it, we do have an operation in Canada that's coming into the United States by boat. So that would be one of the headwinds that we could potentially see from that. But again, it's not gonna be a material issue to the company. But again, in full disclosure, I think that's fair to say. If we think about more indirect impacts from tariffs, I mean, we could certainly see it drive more reshoring and more domestic manufacturing demand. And I think that goes back to your question relative to supply chain. And, you know, it could impact inflation in some degrees, and that could lead to maybe higher for longer, and that could have a negative impact on real estate or residential as we look at it. And I think it goes back to the observation that I shared with Trey. I think we have given a very measured guidance approach today. The fact is if we come back and adjust this, I sure would like to adjust it up. And I hope we put ourselves in the position that that's exactly what we can do, Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.
Ward Nye: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Ward, Jim, I'm wondering if you just talk about the per ton cost cadence that you expect. Obviously, it makes is moving around. And Ward, you spoke about timing of price increases normally. You know, price-cost spread is pretty consistent. Do you expect similar gross profit per ton growth in the first quarter as the full year you just give us a bit of color on the concept of the equation?
Ward Nye: Yeah. I'll ask Jim to come back and give you some color relative to cadence. I wanna come back to the very first notion that you raised, and that is let's talk about what's happening with respect to cost per ton. Because I think this quarter was a really good example of what you can and you should expect going forward. And if you look at it, I thought we had good cost management. You know, if we're looking frankly at organic cogs, they were flat despite revenue being up nicely in the organization. But what I liked, Jerry, is when I go back and look at it, I mean, clearly, energy was down, and energy was down because diesel was better and a host of things. But what I'm moved by is I go through the different cost buckets, whether it was supplies or whether it was repairs or whether it was contract services or otherwise, they're all in the green for the quarter. So I like the way that that's shaping up. And the fact is we can continue to make these businesses that we bought increasingly efficient relative to ASP, but also relative to the cost profile. Now the other part of your question was relative to Cadence. And so for that, let me turn it over to Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Yep. Thanks, Ward. Hey, Jerry. The cadence is gonna be there's two dynamics. One is the P&L effects, the temporary P&L effects of our inventory reduction. That will continue through the first half. So that it's already built into our guide, but that will show up more in the first half, not in the second half, really as much. Aside from that dynamic, the underlying COGS inflation are gonna be pretty consistent throughout the quarters. So that will be pretty evenly balanced. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. We're not anticipating anything changing dramatically on the underlying inflation piece. But again, the inventory worked down, the temporary P&L effects from that, we'll see in the first half, and then that should abate thereafter. Does that answer the question?
Jerry Revich: It does. So just to make sure we're on the same page with you, Jim, so it sounds like you're thinking of gross profit per ton up low single digits maybe in the first half, and then in the back half, maybe mid-teens given the comps on the inventory destock point. Is that range of expectations?
Jim Nickolas: Probably lower variation than what you just described. I would say, you know, low teens kinda consistently, maybe a little bit lower plus or minus a couple of hundred basis points, but low teens growth, you know, I'd say pretty consistently quarter over quarter.
Ward Nye: And, Jerry, let me add one more footnote to that because Jim mentioned the inventory reduction or management efforts that we've been going through. I mean, for the quarter, that was about a $20 million P&L impact. And my point with that is if you think about overall cost control and you think about pricing and you think about the margin expansion that we had in the quarter, given that $20 million headwind on inventory, that's my point. That was a pretty impressive quarter relative to cost control.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning, Anthony.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Hey. You know, you referenced the recent acquisitions, and I'm wondering if it's possible to put a finer point on the volume benefit that you expect in 2025, you know, either in terms of tons or, you know, percentage volume benefit or however you could be able to frame it.
Ward Nye: No. Happy to, Anthony. As a practical matter, if you're looking just at what would have been organic, it's probably up, you know, a percent. And then if you're looking at the balance of it, it's largely acquisition-driven. So I think on a percentage basis, that's probably not a bad way to think about it.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng: Hey, guys. I guess since Trump has stepped into office, certainly a lot of noise on the funding front. On the public side, but seems to be more centered around EV charging station and some of these IRA projects. My question to you, Ward, have you seen any pause in projects and any slowdown in bidding activity for new projects? Just kinda help us kinda think through any choppiness and noise on the public side, we look up 2025.
Ward Nye: No. I appreciate the question. We've not seen any slowdown in that. And in fact, we think that's probably going to continue to be pretty constructive. And I would say for several reasons, one, if we just look at what we think is gonna happen relative to non-res square footage starts. And we're projecting 2025 for recovery of somewhere between 8% and 9%. But to contextualize that, that's still down 19% from 2022's peak and still below a 2021 level. And if we're looking at what we're seeing right now relative to Stargate that I mentioned in my opening comments, at the investments that Amazon is making. We're simply not seeing a slowdown in those sectors right now. If we look in our footprint more specifically, I mean, Google has activity right now both in Kansas City, which is an important market for us as well as in South Carolina. Microsoft, we talked about how much investment they have ahead of them, but they've already got projects underway in North Carolina. And, obviously, I've already mentioned the Amazon projects in both Claiborne, Texas and in Fort Myers. But you know, part of what I'm moved by is we think about the non-res sector is we think industrial construction is going to be pretty healthy. We think health care and education is going to be pretty healthy. And we think the broad commercial real estate sector is going to be the one that's going to come behind that single-family sector that we said is underbuilt by around 7 million homes today, at least according to Realtor.com. So we're not seeing a slowdown in that. We're actually seeing a nice steady pickup in that. And again, so much of what's going to happen in our business is gonna be driven by the locations that we have and the states in which we build leading positions, we believe, are going to be in the front end of much of this development.
Philip Ng: The word, a lot of that commentary was more around private, but I guess in the public side, you haven't seen any choppiness in terms of funding being paused or any of that stuff. And then the IRA piece, you still have as great of appreciation, you know, how much of a good guy has it been and what it could what kind of impact that has on the road.
Ward Nye: Yeah. We're not seeing anything choppy on the public side. We think public is actually going to be really constructive and expected to stay that way for a period of time. I mean, the fact is, if we're looking in Texas this year, Tex dot lettings are gonna be really robust. They were $13.5 billion last year. And they're expected to be in that same range again this year. Again, as you recall, Colorado actually has approved budget of nearly $2.1 billion. North Carolina's budget is gonna increase to I think it's about $7.6 billion. And part of that's driven by the fact that now we're seeing about 6% of sales taxes going into NCDOT. Today. So we think that's gonna be attractive. Equally, if we go to Georgia, I mean, their budget is up 7%. Florida is at record levels. If you take out one-time supplements, they've had. So if we're looking at our state DOT budgets in our top ten states, on a same-on-same basis, eight of the ten year over year up. So that's why when we're looking at the heavy side non-res, and on big infrastructure, we don't anticipate choppiness there. We expect pretty healthy good steady diets of work.
Philip Ng: Okay. Really helpful, Ward. Appreciate it.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Garik Shmois: Hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up question and a new one for me. Just a follow-up just on the inventory drawdown. I was wondering if you could perhaps quantify how much you still have remaining in the first half of the year. And then just broadly on the volume outlook, recognizing that it you're looking for low single-digit growth. Has any of the components changed either for the better or for the worst? Since you provided the preliminary outlook? Back after the third quarter.
Ward Nye: So a couple of things I would say relative to the inventory drawdown, if you think about it, it's about a $30 million headwind in Q3, a $20 million headwind in Q4. We do think we're gonna be done with that by the time we get to half year. And, you know, what that Garik, if you think about bookings, that's probably not a bad way to think about bookending it. And the other part of your question, repeat that again for me, Garik.
Garik Shmois: Yeah. I was wondering if the volume outlook has changed at all since last quarter, you know, recognizing you're still speaking to a low single-digit growth. But, you know, has any component gotten better or worse? You know, maybe infrastructure sounds maybe to my ears a little bit better. Gotcha. You know, it's like yeah. Any other color there?
Ward Nye: So what I would say is, I think people generally have felt like interest is higher for longer. So I think overall, there's a sense that degrees of public are probably gonna be a little bit more muted now than we would have thought several months ago. I mean, I'm sorry, private. But at the same time, I think we feel like public is gonna be pretty healthy. And I think we feel like it has to be. For several reasons, Garik. Number one, you have to assume this administration's gonna be looking at a reauthorization at the end of 2026. And having 70% of those dollars still hanging around the hoop don't sound like a really good idea. So our sense is that's probably gonna be a pretty aggressive play that we're gonna see on public in 2025 and 2026. So I think that probably feels, honestly, a little bit more robust, and I think portions of private probably feels modestly slower for something that feels like a wash.
Garik Shmois: Got it. For that, El Paso, and best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Angel Castillo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sorry to be a dead horse here, but just wanted to clarify on the organic growth side. You talked about maybe 1% and the rest was on the volume side. It was maybe driven by the M&A front. But when you walk through your end markets, you highlighted single digits for infra and then low single-digit growth in resi non-resi. So it seems to imply that the end markets and sales are maybe growing closer to above that 1% if you kinda put that all together. So just curious, is that just conservatism, or is there anything that we should kind of consider there as to why maybe that organic growth is only 1%?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. That it's Jim. That was not organic. That was meant to be kind of a year-over-year view inclusive of the acquisitions.
Angel Castillo: Sorry. The 1% on volume?
Jim Nickolas: No. No. The slides that show, you know, mid-single digits for infra and etcetera, low single digits for the other categories. Those were inclusive of acquisitions.
Ward Nye: Janine, I think to your point and I think to your point, look, we're as I said in my comments, we're trying to be really measured. In this guide, right now. So if we come back to you, we'd like to be guiding up, not sideways or down.
Angel Castillo: Got it. Understood. That's helpful. And then you just wanted to go back to your comments around, you know, the industry pricing and in some pockets perhaps you're trying to April first and maybe a little bit more of a smooth cadence through the first half. Should we take that to mean that midyear's, we're kind of moving as an industry from midyear's, or do you still expect to, you know, see midyears in aggregates?
Ward Nye: I would say a couple of things. One, the guide that we've given you does not assume midyear. But we believe that there will be degrees of midyears just as they were last year. And keep in mind, where we saw them mostly last year were in the new acquisitions. We think we will likely see that again this year. And part of what we'll just have to watch for next year is to see, again, how does cement roll out next year? Because what that did as this year came into play is it really made that January one challenging specifically relative to ready-mix concrete. So again, the January one price increases are broadly in for products going into hot mix. So it's really more of a basically, a ready-mix issue and a cement issue than anything else. But, yes, it does not include midyears in the guide. Do think there will be some midyears. We'll be back to you to talk more about that.
Angel Castillo: Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Tyler Brown: Hey. Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Tyler.
Tyler Brown: Hey, Ward. Hey. As it relates to capital allocation priorities, can you guys talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline? Does a change in the regulatory environment impact anything there? And if that were not to materialize, what's the appetite on debt pay down versus the buyback? Just given the balance sheet health?
Ward Nye: So number one, if you think about, Tyler, $6 billion worth of transactions last year, we ended the year at 2.3 times. Number one. Number two, there's still a lot of work to be done in this industry relative to M&A. And look, I'm gonna see it for the rest of my career, my successor will see it for the rest of their career, and my bet is my successor's successor will see that for a good part of their career as well. As we've indicated before, we firmly identified over 200 million tons of businesses on a per annum basis that are in geographies in which we would have an interest in being. And then to your point, that we believe we can get cleared regulatory. Look, do I think this is gonna be a $6 billion year? No. Probably not. If so, a few things break, could it be? I suppose it always could because it tends to be opportunistic. But my sense is, Tyler, we're looking just in a year-in, year-out circumstance. We're doing around a billion dollars a year of transactions. And we think that's a good steady number. And there are gonna be instances where you may well see it above that. Because you might have something opportunistically that comes along. But if we think back to it as well relative to different administrations, etcetera, one thing that Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. has always been very consistent in doing is being in a position that we look at the market very thoughtfully. And we understand businesses that we believe we can buy regulatory, ones that we can't, and we tend to move very purposely on the ones that we can. Now relative to other uses of cash, let me turn it over to Jim so he can talk a little bit about that.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. Good question, Tyler. We do have a bond coming due in December this year. It's quite small. Whether that's repaid cash and balance sheet or refinance, we'll see going forward, but it's relatively small. And I would anticipate share buybacks to outstrip any kind of debt reduction, if there's any debt reduction at all. So we, you know, we've been in the market last year, bought a fair bit of shares. We'll be in the market again this year, as we are every year. Buying back stock. But that would come before a debt pay down.
Tyler Brown: Yeah. Okay. And then super quick, Jim, it sounds like there's some a few dynamics in first half versus second half, FIFO, pricing cadence, M&A, etcetera. Can you just shape first half and second half EBITDA mix with slightly skew second half any help would be very helpful for remodel. Thanks.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. I think it will skew second half as it traditionally does. Perhaps less so this year than last year though.
Tyler Brown: Okay. Okay. That's helpful.
Jim Nickolas: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen, Jacklyn.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Dudas: Yeah. I'm great. It's a little chilly here in the northeast, but we're suffering through it. So it's all good.
Ward Nye: I would expect nothing else.
Michael Dudas: No. Thank you. You have the residential market. Just a little bit more thought on, you know, it's been frustrating, I think, for most in the industry, you know, that we've seen the affordability and the rate issues. Is it is there sensitivity on, like, if the economy picks up or rates fall just a little bit that there's this pent-up demand will flow through? Are you anticipating that? And is there any shift in say multi versus single that you might portray, say, heading in I know, you know, you got the longer-term numbers, but certainly as things normalize, what kind of a benefit that could be in the regions that you're in.
Ward Nye: Yeah. No. Michael, it's a great question. I would say several things. As we talk to customers and we talk to builders right now, they're focused on buying and entitling land. So number one, I think that's a really good sign. Number two, that tends to be a really good sign relative to single-family residential. And selfishly, we like to skew toward that because that's two to three times more aggregates intensive than this multifamily. The other thing that strikes me is, while it's been a long slog, builder confidence in places like Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, and Georgia is clearly getting better. So we think that's a very good sign. I think they believe starts and permits are expected to pick up more broadly across the marketplace today. And the other thing that I think is worth noting, and I said in the earlier response as well. I do think two degrees buyers are adjusting to higher rates, and I think to your point, I think cuts could actually see a pretty significant surge in demand. It's all gonna be a matter of timing because they're not gonna turn on with immediacy. When we go back to the notion of 7 million homes that are underbuilt, and a disproportionate number of them in states in which or MSAs in which we have a leading position, that's a pretty attractive place to be. So I hope that helps.
Michael Dudas: Sure does. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I apologize for that. I have no other than the airport. I'm in an airport here. So, Ward, I guess on infrastructure right here, you when you say that you're not seeing any interruption in orders right now, but I just sent the elephant in the room is how safe is federal funding for infrastructure construction projects. And I just wanted you to share with us how you would characterize the risk of federal government deoff funds for state DOT projects?
Ward Nye: David, it's a perfectly good question, and I don't see that as a big threat. And here's one of the reasons why. I mean, if you think about the overall IIJA, $1.2 trillion. Right? But $350 billion to highways, bridges, roads, and streets. The things that you and I look at as hardcore construction. And if we think back to when IIJA was going through its debate process in the Senate and in the House. Then former President Trump was not in favor of IIJA because he did not think enough of it was going toward what he would refer to as real infrastructure. So if we look at what's going on with that and we think about what I believe his marching orders have been to Secretary Duffy, and that is to build big. And build big in this context, I think, means highways. Roads, streets, airports, and big heavy infrastructure in the United States. So I think if they do anything with that, I'm not sure that they will, I think it'll be nuanced. And I think if it's nuanced, it's not going to be in those areas that you and I think about as being nicely aggregates intensive and oftentimes countercyclical. So I think if we think of IIJA through that lens, I think that's probably the right place to be. If we think about IRAs, so many of those funds have already been obligated, obviously, a much smaller program anyway. So as I'm sitting here measuring risk, and thinking about the way the administration may be thinking about a reauthorization, I just view bad things happening there as having a relatively low likelihood. So, David, I hope that helps.
David MacGregor: It does. Thanks very much, Ward.
Ward Nye: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the Q4 beat.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam. Good to hear your voice.
Adam Thalhimer: I have two things. I have some confused clients on pricing, and I think you said aggregates pricing up a little bit sequentially in Q1 with a bigger pop in Q2.
Ward Nye: Yeah.
Adam Thalhimer: And then my other question was, vis a vis what somebody else said about the weather. It's been a pretty tough winter. Just curious if we should bake in a conservative Q1.
Ward Nye: You know, I wouldn't go over your skis on baking in a conservative Q1. I think Q1 is gonna be just fine. So I wouldn't lean too hard there. And look, I think you nailed it on the pricing. I'm not at all worried about pricing as Trey indicated in his question too. I mean, an April price increase for some portions of a marketplaces where this industry has resided for a long time. And my only commentary around pricing was I'm trying to make sure from a modeling perspective, to your same point, yeah, I'm not wanting people to get over their skis on certain components as they go through in a month-by-month basis. But if I break yours down, no. I don't think you need to build anything draconian at all into Q1. And I do think if you've got price increases layering in in a more robust way post Q1, your model will hold together in a better fashion.
Adam Thalhimer: Perfect. Thanks, Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Avi Yaroslavich with UBS. Please go ahead.
Avi Yaroslavich: Hi. Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Avi Yaroslavich: Given all the volatility and fluctuations with policymaking these days, just curious how that's affecting your own capital planning and strategic decision-making.
Ward Nye: You know, the nice thing about this industry is I can tell you this company has always been profitable. This company has never cut a dividend. And even when we went through the financial crisis and lost, let's call it, 40, 45% of our volume, we always have pricing power. So when we look at history and let some of the history dictate how we look at the future going ahead. Look, there are gonna be some policy things that will move around. I think the policy issues that I believe we'll see from this administration relative to public and infrastructure will be constructive to what we're doing. I think the quality decisions we may or may not see from this administration relative to tariffs, whether it be cement, steel, or otherwise, will probably be constructive to what we're doing. When I think about where I think this administration would like to see interest rates, and what that can do to single-family housing, I think that ought to be constructive to what we're doing. When I think about a company that has proven itself to be actually very capable at M&A, yeah. I think we're likely to be in a time with availability of potential transactions. And administration that that's frankly gonna be will look more favorably upon transactions going forward than we've seen in the more recent past. So are we watching carefully? Yes. Are we gonna remain agile? Yes. But as we look at it, really start thinking about, you know, what are gonna be potential pluses here? What are gonna be potential minuses here? You know, we see a lot of pluses here. And we see that relative to M&A will look like. We see that relative to what we think monetary policy is going to look like. And frankly, I think we're likely to see it in the way a reauthorization works. And the way that I think about that is I think this administration, while they have control, of a House of Representatives and the United States Senate, are likely to want to get a reauthorization done before midterms. Because it passes prologue, usually, midterms don't work terribly well for the party that's in the White House. So the current administration is looking at having the White House and the Senate and the House of Representatives and is consistent with telling Secretary Duffy to build big. Again, as we're watching the policy decisions that have been announced and policy decisions that we anticipate, I think, on a whole, we feel like they're gonna be pretty positive for Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
Avi Yaroslavich: Alright. Very helpful. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Feniger: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys.
Ward Nye: Of course.
Michael Feniger: Jim, you mentioned you mentioned price versus call spread has widened in recent years. I'm just curious, Ward, if we are in a higher for longer rate environment and that private side is still somewhat under pressure. Is it inevitable that as you turn the page to 2026 that pricing comes back down to that long-term 3% to 4% average? Or, you know, just qualitatively, do you think that price versus cost spread remains wider than maybe what we historically seen, you know, outside of just the last three years?
Ward Nye: So I'm gonna answer your last question first. Look, I think the price-cost spread continues to work in our favor. And I think for a couple of reasons, I think actually twofold on the sentiments. One. And Jim can talk to what we're seeing broadly on inflation. I think inflation is moderating. Inflation is coming down, so that's going to help. But I think the bigger driver is pricing is going to remain in a fundamentally better place going forward than pricing was at least in my view. For all the years up until, let's call it, last two or three. And I think that's a fundamental change. I don't see that changing. Look. If you're looking to face some financial statements as I am, you're seeing ASPs around $22 a ton per aggregates. That's had a nice run. But, Michael, I'm gonna say again, what you've heard me say in the past, there are very few things that you want in your life that you can buy for $22 a ton except our product. And I continue to believe that we're gonna be in a position that we can get an appropriate value for our product going forward. I think we'll see that spread continue. I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit of color relative to what we're seeing with respect to inflation.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. So it's as we indicated late last year, we're still of the same view COGS per ton inflation's mid-single digits, you know, and then, you know, trailing by a fair bit the ASP growth we're expecting. So, you know, based on our guidance, I would say we would expect gross margins to widen that spread by another 100 basis points. In 2025, over 2024, that's even after overcoming the temporary P&L effects of the inventory reduction. So I think that bodes well for 2025, bodes well for 2026. And beyond. So over the arc of history, we've widened. The price-cost spread, it's not a straight line. But it's pretty consistent over time, and I don't see why that would end.
Michael Feniger: Right. Great, Jim. And, Ward, maybe just to one of your earlier comments. I think you said on Q4, you know, the cement margin was healthier relative to what you saw on ready mix. Just how is that evolving in 2025? I mean, I think Nat Gas cement versus ready mix in 2025.
Ward Nye: Well, I would tell you, I think considerably better about cement than about ready mix in 2025 even as we're looking cement for the quarter, I mean, pricing was constructive. You know, the fact is the business really performed well despite pretty significant headwinds from a weather perspective in both November and December. And we saw nice revenues in cement. We saw good gross profit. We saw good gross margins, good EBITDA. Importantly, that FM7 operation that we opened, it was running at greater than 90% of availability. There in the fourth quarter after we opened that up. So again, you know, we're not gonna be cement every place. We're gonna be cement where it's really strategic to us. And in Dallas Fort Worth, it is really strategic. And Midlothian is a fantastic cement plant. Now if you think about what's happening relative to ready mix, your volume is relatively flat there. The dilemma that Ready Mix has is Ready Mix is taking significant aggregate price increases. It's taking cement price increases, and it's hard for Ready Mix to keep pricing ahead of that. So if we think about what the combination is gonna look like, you're gonna see some margin compression in ready mix. But again, if we think about Ready Mix, it's so much of a shock absorber for our company. We have it in very select markets. It's important to us in places like Dallas Fort Worth, Arizona. But, you know, your question really was geared around cement, and I wanted to make sure I gave you a good robust snapshot of the way cement is performing because if you could really see it at a granular basis, you'd be very comfortable with it as are we.
Michael Feniger: Thank you.
Ward Nye: You're most welcome.
Operator: And that concludes our question and answer session. And I will now turn the conference back over to Ward Nye for closing comments.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kristen. Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. Welcome to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only. A question-and-answer session will follow the company’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin.
Jacklyn Rooker: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available, during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance, our preliminary view for 2025 and supporting market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. During the third quarter, we experienced a series of well-chronicled extreme weather events, including significant July precipitation together with Tropical Storm Debby in North Carolina, Hurricane Beryl in Texas and Hurricane Helene across much of our Southeast footprint. First and foremost, we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe. Our thoughts, prayers and ongoing support remain focused on those who have suffered so disproportionately during these natural disasters. We're particularly mindful of our neighbors in Western North Carolina as they begin the long process of rebuilding. Aside from the human cost of these events, we and a host of other businesses were affected by the storms. In our specific case, project delays and inefficiencies negatively impacted our financial results. And as a consequence, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.07 billion at the midpoint. To help better demonstrate the severity of these weather events during the last two quarters to our upstream product shipments, we provided two case studies on Page 8 of our supplemental information. The first case study is particularly revealing relative to cement. As you will recall, the second quarter's significant precipitation was particularly notable in Dallas-Fort Worth, our company's single largest market area, resulting in an 18% decline in our mid low-teen cement shipments. Encouragingly, as the weather improved, so did Midlothian's third quarter shipments. Shifting now to aggregates. Our implied fourth quarter shipment guide reflects a 5% increase in shipments, a notable improvement relative to the third quarter's 4% decline. Our fourth quarter view is primarily based on October's trends and reasonable expectations for the remainder of the year. These statistics demonstrate the important irony of disruptive and destructive weather. Planned shipments are not generally canceled, they're delayed. And depending on seasonality and severity, resumption of planned shipments usually occurs in the following months and/or quarters. Despite these weather-related events, I'm pleased to highlight some of our team's accomplishments. First, we achieved the best year-to-date safety incident rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, our teams achieved record quarterly aggregates gross profit per ton of $8.16, record third quarter cash flows from operations and record third quarter revenues and gross profit in our Magnesia Specialties business. Given the totality of the quarter's uncontrollable and exigent circumstances, these are notable records upon which we intend to build. With respect to continuing to build, in October, we acquired pure aggregate assets in South Florida and Southern California, both attractive and growing Martin Marietta markets. Consistent with our strategic operating analysis and review, or SOAR plan, these bolt-on acquisitions further enhance our gross profit contribution from the aggregates product line and improve the long-term durability of our business. Together, these accomplishments reflect our team's focus on matters we can control while underscoring the resiliency of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically positioned in the country's fastest-growing markets. Importantly, these results reinforce our expectation that our aggregates price cost spread will continue to expand over time, driving improvement in unit profitability through macroeconomic cycles. As we look towards 2025, we remain focused on the long-term aspects of our business that we can meaningfully impact, world-class safety, the consistent and disciplined execution of our strategic plan, resolute adherence to our leading commercial strategy and prudent cost management through ongoing operational excellence efforts. Equally, we expect product shipments will recover due to more normal weather patterns and an expected improvement in warehouse and residential construction. Preliminarily, we expect that 2025 overall aggregate shipments will increase by low single-digits and aggregates pricing will increase by mid to high single-digits. Moving now to end market trends. Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming elections, both rebuilding and maintaining our nation's infrastructure remains a bipartisan national strategic priority. Record levels of state and federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, continue to support attractive demand for highways and streets construction. And while growth rates in contract awards have predictably flattened, as reflected in the value of contract awards for the 12-month period ending August 31, 2024, the baseline for highway and street spending is well above historical levels. Looking ahead, funding certainty at the state and federal level will provide volume stability and support a healthy pricing environment in this aggregate intensive, often countercyclical end market for years to come. Relative to heavy nonresidential construction, the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure supports emerging growth trends in both data centers and related energy requirements. Moreover, aggregates-intensive warehouse construction appears to be cyclically bottoming in select markets, as indicated by recent project announcements. For example, Amazon is planning to build one of its largest North American distribution centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with our leading aggregates position, strategic and large capacity cement plant, and affiliated ready mixed presence in this dynamic market, Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to supply materials to this project, which is expected to begin later this year. Shifting now to light nonresidential and residential activity, housing availability and affordability remain key issues impacting single-family demand. While a correction of these issues will not be immediate, we believe that loosening monetary policy is an important first step. It passed its prologue, and we believe that to be the case as residential construction recovers, light nonresidential activity typically follows. In summary, we believe multiyear public construction activity, reshoring, the artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out and the long-awaited single-family housing-led residential recovery all call us to support durable aggregate shipment growth and continued attractive pricing momentum for years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.8 billion, a 6% decrease, and gross profit of $588 million, a 9% decrease. The decline in both metrics is due to the February divestiture of our South Texas cement and related concrete businesses, along with shipment declines in all product lines, partially offset by acquisition contributions. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 3% to a quarterly record of $8.16, notwithstanding lower shipment volumes, highlighting the efficacy of our value over volume commercial strategy. Aggregates pricing increased 7.7% or 8.9% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. Cement and concrete revenues decreased 30% to $296 million, and gross profit decreased 37% to $89 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations. I'm pleased to report the construction of our new finished mill at Midlothian is complete, which will provide us with approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 5% to $343 million, and gross profit decreased 8% to $61 million. Wet weather, project delays and a softer nonresidential market drove the shipment decline, while lower revenues and higher aggregates costs negatively impacted profitability. Magnesia Specialties posted record third quarter revenues and gross profit of $82 million and $29 million, respectively, as benefits from strong pricing and improved lime shipments more than offset lower chemical shipments. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. As Ward mentioned, we achieved record third quarter cash flows from operations of $601 million, an increase of 32% as compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to working capital improvements that more than offset lower net earnings. Consistent with our long-standing capital allocation priorities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates assets, invested $622 million of capital back into our business and returned $591 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In our 30 years as a publicly traded company, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, and this year is no exception. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase to the quarterly cash dividend paid in September, reaffirming our confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. We have now returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0 times for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, preserving financial flexibility to continue actively pursuing value-enhancing high-quality aggregates acquisitions and prudently reinvesting in our business all while returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders through dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. As our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, Martin Marietta remains focused on matters we can control, an unwavering commitment to safety and the environment, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. We have thoughtfully shaped and expanded our aggregates-led portfolio and deliberately built our business with leading positions in the nation's fastest-growing markets, making Martin Marietta an increasingly resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. With these attractive underlying fundamentals, our best-in-class teams, unparalleled growth opportunities and proven strategic priorities, we're excited about the prospects in 2025 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with TRG. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Probably my question on weather and then looking forward. So how did weather impact Q3 results, both from a volume and a pricing optic standpoint? And could you give color on how shipments have trended into October and really looking at post-storms? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Kathryn, thanks for the question. It's a good one because that really does highlight much of what happened in the quarter. Several things that I would say. Number one, as we discussed before, Q2 in its own way, was a washout. And Q3 was as well, from a weather perspective, which is why we put that supplemental slide on Page 8 in the deck today because I think it does give good color relative to how significant the weather events were to our shipments. So as you can see, if you look at that slide, Q2 was really severe in DFW, and as Q3 rolled around, it wasn't as bad in DFW, and you saw a really nice snapback in volumes at Midlothian. Now Q3 was just tough across the Southeast and much of the East. Look, here's your takeaway. We literally had a hurricane every 2.5 weeks in Q3. And they were coming through and disproportionately hitting our Eastern business and a lot of it, frankly, our Southeastern business. And to your point, Kathryn, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest ASPs, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest margins, that's the sweet spot. And that's the part that really was hit hard, hard, hard in the quarter. So if we're looking at it overall, did it affect the shipments? I think, notably. Disproportionate drive our shipments down, absolutely. It was a disproportionate driver of what happened to the profitability because of the wear. And then the other piece of it is it made it more difficult in some instances to get the same degree of midyear price increases this year that we saw last year. So you really had almost a trifecta of issues that went through. Now to the second part of your question, it's a good one. I was reading the Wall Street Journal this morning, it was talking about much of the country being in some degree of a drought in October. And the fact is October has been much more normal. And what we've seen in October is really what is driving what you've seen relative to our aggregate forecast going forward because if you look at it, what it's basically saying is we're anticipating aggregates to be up 5% in Q4. And that's really on the back of what we're seeing in October. So several things I would note, as I think about the durability and how real that is. One, we're seeing the tonnage. Two, we're seeing our customers continue to add to their backlogs. So we're seeing nice sequential build in customer backlogs. And the other thing to me that's telling is our customers are hiring right now, too. So when you're seeing good activity that we're seeing in October when we're seeing dry weather, when we're seeing good activity from backlog from a customer perspective, and we're seeing contractors hiring right now, we think all of those together give a nice picture of what's to come. But when you step back from it, too, it answers, I think, the essence of your question. How much did weather matter? Answer, it mattered a lot. How much did it matter relative to volume? A lot. How much does it matter relative to profitability? Frankly, even more than it did relative to volume. So Kathryn, I hope that helps.
Kathryn Thompson: It does. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Ward and Jim. Hope you are doing well.
Ward Nye: Yes.
Trey Grooms: So, kind of a follow-on to that. Clearly, the Carolinas, particularly Western North Carolina, which is right in your guys backyard, were unfortunately devastated by Helene. And there's other areas as well that have seen pretty serious issues as a result of the extreme weather. If you could maybe talk about some of the recovery efforts that are going on there and what that could mean for Martin Marietta, given that it is right here in your backyard.
Ward Nye: Yes, Trey, it is in our backyard, and you're right. And Western North Carolina did feel that, the words that I gave in the prepared remarks were disproportionately, so we are trying to make sure that we're doing all we can to help that part of the state rebuild. I mean, here are some data points for you. NCDOT estimates that the Helene recovery expenses will be between $5 billion and $6 billion, just relative to NCDOT. Now to put some other color to that, typically, the federal government reimbursement rate for that is between 60% and 65%, which means as a practical matter, North Carolina’s share of that burden is going to be about $2 billion. Now as we think about how we're positioned to help rebuild that part of the state, several things I'd point to. Number one, we have operations in North Carolina that go nicely west of Hickory. So we're getting into the foothills, getting into the Appalachians with our North Carolina operations. It's important to remember, too, that with the Blue Water transaction, we actually acquired a number of sites in Eastern Tennessee. So that now puts us into a position that we can come into those areas, both from Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina to make sure we're providing the work and the support that, that area is going to need. Now importantly, too, NCDOT has said that it's going to be business as usual in terms of construction and maintenance activity outside of the work for Helene. So we're not going to see other parts of the state not continuing to advance. North Carolina can do that and take care of what's happening relative to Helene. And I think this is an important piece of it, too, Trey, because when we talk about SOAR and where we have built our business and why. One of the areas that we've long said is we want to be in states that are in a good fiscal condition because when these type of things happen, we need to be in places that states can manage that. And it was interesting, I was reading a piece in the Pew Trust last week, and it outlined that North Carolina was only one of a handful of states, literally, that use a budget stress test to determine how much should be set aside in its rainy day fund. And the state currently has a surplus of $6 billion in that. And if you're keeping score at home, that's about $4.25 billion more than we saw in the last budget. So will there be rebuilding? Yes. Is it going to be extensive? Yes. Will it take not months or years, but probably the better part of a decade? My guess is that it will and will be there to help, absolutely.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thank you for all the color on that. I’ll pass it on. Good luck.
Ward Nye: You bet. Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks for having me on. I was wondering if you can go over the acquisitions that you made in a little bit more detail in South Florida and California. Any more color on the size of the acquisitions, the volume contribution, how pricing looks in these markets? And maybe help us think about if there's any either a benefit in 4Q or any kind of related headwind as you integrate and what the outlook for '25 will play?
Ward Nye: Garik, thanks for the question. Yeah, I can help you with that a little bit. So number one, both these transactions are totally consistent with SOAR. And what I mean by that is you've seen us historically go into relatively new markets for Marietta like we did in California or Florida in this instance. And we basically do platform transactions and then we come behind them with a series of bolt-ons where we can augment our position. That's exactly what you're seeing in both of these deals. So I would tell you several things. One, both are complementary. They are both pure aggregate bolt-ons. So again, one in the High West in Southern California, one where we bought Blue Water. Equally, and I think this is important, both our percentage margin and unit margin accretive. So these are attractive, pure stone businesses. The combined reserves are over 150 million tons in areas with notable reserve shortages. So again, we continue to augment our reserve position in those markets. Integration is going to be complete very, very quickly. New pricing will be effective on January 1. What's important is doing all of these together and with both these transactions, it's still sub $1 billion on what we've done. Our leverage remains completely within our target range, and the pipeline of aggregates acquisitions remains active. So we think there's more to come on that. Relative to the guide for the rest of this year, we've effectively put nothing in the guide for the rest of this year for these businesses because as you recall, the tyranny of purchase price accounting in this means that we had to take all of the inventory there and mark it up to fair market value. So what you anticipate after a transaction is for those early months, you're not going to see that much from a P&L perspective. But these transactions, frankly, Garik, like so much of this year has been a setup for 2025. This puts us in better positions in markets where we want to have these leading positions. These are attractive pure stone transactions. And again, we believe the commercial trends that we will see at these operations will continue to be very attractive. And part of what I think is worth noting as well. If we go back and take a look at even the Blue Water transactions that we've done, and what we've done relative to getting those businesses back up to something that looks more like Martin Marietta market pricing, when you and I had this conversation at Q2, there was about a $5 a ton delta on ASP between the acquired operations and heritage at that point. Now that's about $3 a ton. So I think if you take the overall philosophy that we have, look at the geographies in which we've made these transactions, what the reserve base looks like and what it can mean in our heritage business and acquired businesses, as you can tell probably from my tone and words, we're pretty excited about these deals.
Garik Shmois: Yeah, sounds like it. Thanks guys.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Garik.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everone.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Ward, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the pricing revision and guidance. So normally, midyear set you folks up for pricing the following year. So can you just expand on the drivers of the negative revisions to the pricing outlook this year? And then as we think about the outlook for mid to high single-digits in '25, you folks had previously spoken about moving to higher sustainable pricing than what we've seen in the past, which would essentially be the mid-single-digit part of the range. So I don't know if that's a mix of M&A that's driving that or other factors, but can I trouble you to expand in those areas, please.
Ward Nye: No, happy to. So, it’s several things. Answering the back part of your question first. I just think we're going to see good, steady durable pricing going forward. Look, I think that mid- to high probably, with an emphasis on high, is probably the right way to think of it next year because one, we're just going to see more price in our heritage businesses. Number two, we're going to continue to see the acquisitions move up nicely. If we think about what happened just here in the last three months, I think several things very candidly, One, did weather impacted delays from a geographic mix perspective caused some headwinds? You bet. If we're looking also at what some of the geographic mix has been, meaning we're selling more fines or other lower-priced materials, that was the piece of it as well. And when you take the weather-impacted delays and the other issues faced with the year, we did see a lower percentage of midyear price increases this year than we saw last year. That's nothing that causes me any concern as I look at it. I think this year was faced with some very challenging near-term dynamics that helped drive that, which means the carry over next year is smaller than it was this year. So we're only looking at about 80 basis points that are carry over for next year. So I think that gives you a sense as we think about the build, the type of resolve we have around a very good marketplace next year with respect to pricing. And again, what I'm taken by, Jerry, is it's hard to produce what we produce on a spec market basis and put it out there and sell it for what we sell it for. I continue to believe that the value of what we're putting on the ground and the value that we add to overall construction is still something that has some running room ahead of it for all the right reasons. But I hope that answers your question.
Jerry Revich: It does. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: Understanding the impact of the weather on 3Q in '24, as you look to '25, can you just talk about how backlogs have trended? And if there's anything you pull up from either an end market perspective or a geographic perspective? And then just given the outsized weather impact this year, does that give you maybe a little bit more visibility or confidence into volumes for the following year, given we may be seeing kind of a catch-up or a rebound year?
Ward Nye: Thank you for the question, Anthony. I think it certainly does. And if we're looking at current backlogs, I mean, they are up very nicely relative to the prior year quarter and sequentially as well, both in the mid-single-digits range right now. So when you're sitting there at this point of the year with that degree of up with what I think is a lot of upside ahead of us, that's what starts to give us a sense of that next year clearly is going to be a much improved year relative to volume. If we think about end users all by themselves, there's no reason, from my perspective, that we shouldn't expect public to be better, frankly, for the next couple of years at least. If we look at the IIJA funds that are actually in the system today, I mean, what's been obligated is one thing. What's actually been spent and what's been reimbursed is actually considerably lower. And frankly, it's in the 20% range right now. So there's so much more of that to come. And then when we tackle that together with state DOT budgets, that are actually in a very good position. I gave a little bit of color a few minutes ago where North Carolina is just in a host of different perspectives. But again, if we're looking at our top 10 states, 80-plus-percent of those actually see their budgets up for next year. Equally, if we look at resi, we believe, clearly, resi is not going to be something that's going to turn on a dime, but we are seeing that, we believe, beginning to turn with some green shoots in a series of markets. And frankly, we almost have to see it. The population dynamic trends have been so significant in the states in which we have leading positions, that the single-family housing market is in dire need of greater activity. But I think importantly, too, and you heard me mention in the prepared remarks, when we're seeing things like suddenly warehousing showing some degrees of green shoots. Obviously, that has been a sector of heavy non-res that has been looking for bottom for a while. We think it's really finding bottom. And now when we're seeing Amazon put in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, one of its largest facilities in North America, we think that's the moment. But equally, as we start thinking about AI and what that's going to mean and energy and what that's going to mean and the reassuring that we know is coming. These, to me, underscore what I believe will be a nice, steady sequential multiyear build. It should be that. And then relative to the light non-res, keep in mind, that's actually been better over the last couple of quarters on a percentage basis of our volume than heavy non-res has been. And that tells me, as we see a res recovery, we're likely to see a more quickly than usual recovery in light non-res. So I think those things, as we build them together, Anthony, is what gives us a high degree of confidence next year and what we're talking about on volumes. I do think, as a company, I do think as an industry, we're usually pretty good at having a good feel for what's happening commercially. I'm not sure that we're always great on knowing precision, what's going to happen with volumes. So I think if we've done anything, we'd probably err to the side of being relatively cautious with respect to our volume outlook next year, and that still has us up.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful color. I’ll turn it over.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Anthony.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Angel Castillo: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Thanks for all that color, that was very helpful. Just maybe wanted to switch over to the cost side of the kind of price/cost dynamic. And just if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're kind of anticipating there as we head into 2025?
Ward Nye: No, happy to. And I'll ask Jim to take you through what we're seeing from an inflation perspective and otherwise.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. So the underlying inflation for this quarter was actually coming close to where we expected, about mid-single-digits, call it, 5%. The additional COGS per ton inflation we saw was largely due to our inventory drawdown for the quarter. And that will continue probably a little bit into next quarter. But for 2025 in total, I would -- I'm still sticking with my mid-single-digit cost inflation view overall, which would be obviously well below where Ward clearly enunciated our ASP expectations are mid to high single-digits. So the price/cost spread should continue to trend favorably. And again, inflation, if anything, it seems to be trending down. So more to come on that next year. We'll come up with after Q4 earnings.
Angel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Angel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Philip Ng: Hey, guys. Ward, great to hear that aggregates volumes are trending up 5% in the fourth quarter now that weather has cleared out. Does that number include some of the recent acquisitions you've just [indiscernible] P&L impact, it doesn't have much. And when we look at the 2025, I think, the low single-digit volume framework, is that on an organic basis as well? Just trying to get a better handle what you're actually seeing out there?
Ward Nye: No. Look, great questions, Angel. Thank you so much for that. So short answer is no, no. Q4 is not taking into account anything from the new acquisitions. And again, we talked a little bit about the purchase price accounting. I'm sorry, Phil. And so it doesn't have anything in there for Q4. And again, we'll come back and really factor those into the guide when we come back to you in February, Phil, and give you a better feel for what we think 2025 will look like. And that's where you will see the Southern California and South Florida transactions factored into it. I hope that helps.
Philip Ng: Okay. So fourth quarter volume, up 5%. And next year up low single digits, largely organic. That's really encouraging to see.
Ward Nye: That's correct. Yes, Phil. You got it.
Philip Ng: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet. Take care.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Tyler Brown: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Hey, good morning, Tyler.
Tyler Brown: Hey, lots of good color on the call. But Jim, if I look at CapEx, I think it's up to $875 million at the midpoint from $700 million at the midpoint, I think, last quarter. It seems like a pretty big jump. And I'm just curious if there was some opportunistic land purchases? Or was that Midlothian? Any color there? And just any early thoughts on CapEx into '25?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. So it's largely a function of the two acquisitions that Ward mentioned. One of those is structured in a way that's being treated as CapEx, and that is an operational acquisition. So that bump up in CapEx guide for the year is almost solely attributable to that deal. And next year, we typically guide to 9%, 9.5% of revenues. So probably not a bad way to think about it to start for next year. We'll have more detail next year, though.
Tyler Brown: Okay. That answers my question. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Welcome. Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman: Hey, thanks, good morning. Ward or Jim, just with respect to the Midlothian expansion. I guess when you think about the supply-demand dynamics in that region, would you expect to sell out that incremental capacity next year? Or is there a ramp-up period with that new capacity we need to consider?
Ward Nye: Thanks for the question. The short answer is, this is going to be a ramp-up period for that. Look, that's an important marketplace to us. We want to go about that in a very thoughtful way. Midlothian is performing actually very well right now. I mean it's been interesting that we actually saw improved gross profit per ton at Midlothian. We've seen very constructive pricing in Midlothian, which tells you what a different marketplace in North Texas is from many others. And so we will be very thoughtful. We'll be very careful and we'll be very methodical about how we go about that at Midlothian. So short answer is, don't expect all of that next year, expect that over a period of time, and yes, it will ramp.
Brent Thielman: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Ward Nye: Hi, David.
David MacGregor: Hi, good morning. I guess I want to start with just a clarification on Garik's question, and then I have a question for you. But on the clarification, you had talked about the delta going from $5 to $3 a ton. I guess that how many tons would you say, just approximately, that $3 a ton would apply to? And then I have another question.
Ward Nye: Yeah. No, I don't know that we've ever come out with precise tonnage on that. But what I would refer you back to, take a look at Blue Water and take a look at Frei because those are really the two different transactions to which that metric applies. So it's really going to mean Denver in one instance. Central and Eastern Tennessee in another, and in primarily portions of Northern Alabama. Obviously, the Blue Water transaction covered more states than that. But from a gravity perspective, that's most of it, David.
David MacGregor: Right. So you're caught up in California now?
Ward Nye: We are largely caught up in California. That's exactly right.
David MacGregor: Right. Okay. And I guess my question was more regarding tariffs and cement. And just mindful that in Midlothian, you're quite removed from the import market influence. Down in Houston, there's probably a $40 to $50 ton price discrepancy between those two markets, which you alluded to a moment ago. How much would DFW benefit from cement tariffs?
Ward Nye: That's a great question. I mean there's just not a lot of import activity that goes into DFW to begin with because the transportation logistics becomes so complicated, getting it there by some form of either river or ocean going vessel then offloading then going through the boards then putting it on trucks and then sending it a long way. So look, I think Dallas Worth, simply because of its location that far from water is different. I think Dallas Fort Worth, because of the overall economy in DFW, I mean when we bought TXI, we bought it in large measure, not exclusively thinking the Dallas-Fort Worth would probably be the best-looking heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 or 30 years. And we've been right on that. And I don't see anything that makes us change our view on it. So is it already a good market? Yes. Do we anticipate it's going to stay a good market? Yes. What I answer your question, look, if tariffs come in, does it make a really good market look even better? The answer is yeah, I think it does.
David MacGregor: Good. Thanks very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Mike Dudas: Good morning, Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.
Ward Nye: Hi, Mike.
Mike Dudas: Again, I appreciate all the observations looking towards your business in 2025. Maybe you can maybe look at it from a geographic basis, as you look at your volume and pricing guidance. Is there areas of your East versus Western business that you feel more comfortable with? Is there any upside surprises in some of the regions that we might typically not think about? Is that also, I assume, may impact the mix and your ability to grow gross profit per ton in 2025?
Ward Nye: Mike, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One, as we discussed earlier in the call, the pricing dynamic that we needed to address in California has largely been addressed. And now we have a more formidable business there with the M&A that we've done. So I would continue to think in particular that Southern California would be a marketplace that should be a relatively bright spot for us. Number two, I would say Texas is going to continue to be a bright spot for us. Clearly, North Texas, as I look at the market, I really think of it, North Texas, Central Texas, South Texas in those three buckets. I think North Texas is going to continue to be the strongest of those markets. I think Central Texas is going to be absolutely fine as well. And again, the TxDOT program there shows growth going into next year. again, Florida will continue to be an important market for us for 2 different reasons. One, we've historically been the largest importer of granite into that market. So we had a disproportionate infrastructure view in that marketplace. Now though that we're getting in-state operations that can really start feeding more concrete and feed more private work, we're going to see continuing attractive work in Florida. If we think about North Carolina, we've gone through that. One, the DOT program is up year-over-year. Number two, we've talked about what would be of necessity, a significant rebuild in the western part of the state and we think that will continue to be attractive. But equally, if we look at Indiana, their budget's up next year. If we look at Georgia, their budget's up almost -- it's over 7% next year. Colorado's budget is up 14%. Arizona's budget is equally up double digits next year. So if I'm thinking about overall end users, I mean, that clearly addresses it relative to the public side. And I've said earlier, that ought to be good for at least a couple of years. Equally, as we think about private in those states, those are all fast-growing states that have seen significant population trends. So my view is the long-term, and medium term and near-term volume picture ought to be increasingly attractive and long term, medium and short term, the commercial side and the pricing piece of it ought to outkick whatever historical coverage is. That's going to continue to perform in ways that I will think will be a differentiator relative to other industrial sectors.
Mike Dudas: Excellent work. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You’re most welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: Yeah. Hey, good morning. Wanted to dig a little bit more into the end market outlook on Slide 7 of your supplemental information. So specifically, I guess, starting with the non-res private sector piece, the data centers are generally pretty low single-digits of total percent. The other pieces tend to be a lot bigger. Like what are you seeing in data centers? Is there something specific to your geographies where you know of some big, lumpy projects coming through? Yeah, go ahead.
Ward Nye: I'm sorry, Timna. I didn't mean to interrupt. Was there more, Timna? I didn't mean to interrupt you.
Timna Tanners: Well, I was just hoping for a little more color like on why you might have been more neutral on warehouses and manufacturing given some of the IRA projects. So just a little more color on that segment. Thanks.
Ward Nye: That's very helpful. Thank you so much. So look, if we're looking at data centers and what's coming from the build-out of AI, in particular, I mean, I can look at a big Google project in Kansas City that has got significant tonnage with it. I can look at actually Microsoft data centers oddly enough in Western North Carolina, near Hickory and our quarries in Mayton. Google, again, is establishing two new data centers, campuses in South Carolina. Those have a combined investment of about $3.3 billion. So again, it's one thing to see that degree of data centers going in. It's another to see the AI coming with or somewhere behind it. But the energy piece of this is going to be real. And the energy piece of it is going to be very, very aggregates intensive. And to your point, I'm shifting going from data warehousing to just warehousing. I mentioned before, I do believe that warehouse construction does appear to be cyclically bottoming right now. I mean we talked about that Amazon facility that's Cleburne, Texas. Again, if we just look at the quantum of aggregates and cement and concrete that will go into that, it's going to be really very, very significant. And then when we start thinking about the other light non-res demand that will likely come behind that, at least some -- those are some of the specifics, Timna, if you're just looking really from a micro perspective, what does some of the markets look like and what are we seeing from data that gives us a good sense of confidence around that. That's part of what we're looking at.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Thanks. And then on the infrastructure side, I wanted to ask kind of high level, I guess. I don't want to make you go through all the different state budgets again, but there has been a disappointment, as you know, since the 2021 passage of IIJA. There's been kind of a trickle or a slow processing of some of those dollars. What is it about 2025 that's really going to kick into gear? And how does that offset some of the cost inflation that's accumulated since it was passed? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Timna, I would say a couple of things. One, 2024 has really been the first year that we've seen significant or, frankly, any federal IIJA dollars coming through. So if you think about what that means as a branch of matter, you're seeing it for the very first year in 2024. And you're going to have some of that carryover into 2025. Then you're going to have new work that's being bid in 2025 as well. So I think the states are moving forward. And of course, the dialogue you and I were having a few minutes ago was largely built around those state budgets. At the same time, I think here's the big surprise, I think, in some respects. I think if somebody had said to us in 2021, hey, by the time you're in the last quarter of 2024, do you think you will have only seen 20-some percent of those dollars that had been authorized moving through the system? I think the answer would have been kind of that feels a little bit slow, but we know the dollars are there. We know the dollars are coming. And that's why I have the sense that look, if we're looking at the public side of it, should that be almost irrefutably better in '25 and '24 and continue to build in '26. Frankly, Timna, I think it almost has to, when we look at the federal dollars and we look at the state budgets and the geography in which we're operating. So that's the way that we've looked at that and basically handicapped it in our minds.
Timna Tanners: Okay, very helpful. Thanks again.
Ward Nye: Most welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Our line is open.
Michael Feniger: Great. Thank you, for squeezing me in. Just a clarification question, Ward. Your full year '24 shipment guide, obviously down 2.5% to 4%. If it was flat, if underlying demand was flat, how much weather do you think '24 versus '23 weighed on growth? Is it 1%, 2%? I guess the genesis of the question, Ward, is if you're growing low single-digit growth in 2025, that's organic, is the volume growth actually a little bit higher next year, barring weather just isn't a disaster?
Ward Nye: Michael, I think it certainly could be. And I think if we've done anything, I think we've taken a relatively thoughtful, cautious view of next year because I think if we go to it, I don't want to give percentages on what I think weather has done this year. But it would not be a small percentage on what weather has done this year. And keep in mind, last year, we had a weather year that was maybe normal to dry. This year, we've had one that has been epically wet. If we just hit something next year that feels normal, particularly in geographies that are disproportionately important to us like the Southeast. Look, I think there are a lot of moving parts that point to attractive trends and growth for next year.
Michael Feniger: That's really helpful, Ward. And just a follow-up on the pricing, let's say, closer to the high single-digit range potentially. Is that relatively even through the year? Does that not include midyears? Is that more second half weighted? Just any kind of anecdotal kind of commentary you would like to think about, how we think about that preliminary '25 as that kind of moves through the year? Thank you.
Ward Nye: As you said, it is preliminary. And no, it does not take into account mid-years for next year, and that's typically the way that we do that. Even when we'll come back to you and give you more precision in February. It's usually not taking into account mid-year. So that simply gives it some degree of tailwind as well. So that's how I would encourage you to think about that.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to Ward for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Thank you again for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Martin Marietta's future is bright, thanks to the consistent and thoughtful execution of our strategic priorities by our world-class teams. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to continue delivering leading financial safety and operational performance while extending our long track record of delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin.
Jacklyn Rooker: Good morning. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's websites. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Howard Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our second quarter operating performance and our Blue Water Industries acquisition, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2024 in current market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. As indicated in today's earnings release, several dynamics impacted our second quarter financial results and particularly product shipments. The most notable driver was an historic 119% increase in precipitation in Dallas-Fort Worth our company's single largest and most profitable metropolitan marketplace as well as disproportionate rain and flooding in parts of the Midwest. Secondarily, the lag effect of restrictive monetary policy is pressuring interest rate-sensitive private construction demand more than previously anticipated. And while our value over volume philosophy also contributed modestly to the shipment decline, the benefits of our commercial strategy are clearly evidenced by the second quarter strong unit profitability growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Moving forward, our team remains focused on what we can control, and view the demand impacts from weather and high interest rates is temporary. That said, we expect slower shipment trends to persist in the year's second half. As a result, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint. While second quarter shipments were below our initial expectations, there were notable highlights worthy of mention as foundational for Martin Marietta's long-term success. Starting first with Safety, I'm proud to report that we concluded the first half of 2024 with the best Safety incidents rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin and achieved record second quarter organic and total aggregates gross profit despite significant weather headwinds. Importantly, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with aggregates average selling price increasing 11.6% or 12% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. We expect this commercial momentum and related margin expansion to continue following realization of our previously announced July pricing actions. These accomplishments underscore the resiliency of our aggregates-led business reinforced by our teams' fidelity to maintaining a safe workplace and our unrelenting commitment to both commercial and operational excellence. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, on April 5, we completed the acquisition of 20 aggregates operations from Blue Water Industries, and in so doing, efficiently redeploy the cash proceeds from the South Texas cement and concrete divestiture. These high-quality pure-play aggregates operations from Blue Water strategically complement our existing footprint in the Southeastern United States and position us in attractive new markets including Tennessee and South Florida for future growth. I'm pleased to report that the integration of both the Blue Water and Albert Frei & Sons acquisitions is complete. The combined financial performance has exceeded management's initial expectations, and the synergy realization will be increasingly compelling. Moving forward, the M&A pipeline remains active and largely focused on pure-play aggregates businesses and attractive or identified geographies. Shifting now to end market trends, our single most aggregates-intensive end use is infrastructure, which continues to benefit from increased funding and investment levels, while highway and street spending is expected to remain well above historic levels, leading indicators are predictably starting to lap more robust comparable periods. This is evidenced in the value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, which declined modestly below 2023 levels to $114 billion. Funding certainty at the federal level through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, together with record state DOT budgets and constituent actions support a healthy pricing environment for construction materials in 2025 and beyond. With the 2024 election process well underway, it's important to note rebuilding and enhancing our nation's infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities remain bipartisan, national strategic priorities, as revealed by the high passage rates on local infrastructure ballot initiatives and three key legislative actions, the IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moving now to heavy non-residential construction, reshoring activity for large manufacturing and energy projects continues to drive product demand. Aside from warehouse construction, which is contracting from its post-COVID peak, starts on a square footage basis remained well above what were healthy in 2019 levels. While not wholly offsetting, construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the June 2024 seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending at $236 billion, a 19% increase from the June 2023 value of $198 billion. Importantly, the breadth of reshoring projects is expanding from automotive, batteries and semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. For example, Novo Nordisk is investing $4 billion to build a 1.4 million square foot manufacturing facility near Raleigh, North Carolina, which we're well positioned to supply from our nearby quarries. In addition, while artificial intelligence is in its early stages, Martin Marietta is geographically well positioned to capitalize on the related data center and infrastructure build-out led by big tech, including Amazon, whose announced plans to invest more than $100 billion over the next decade on data centers alone. Relative to light non-residential and residential activity, restrictive monetary policy continues to impact these interest rate sensitive end markets. The lock-in effect of high mortgage rates and low inventory are only serving to exacerbate the well-chronicled housing affordability and availability issues in many of our company's key metropolitan areas. That said, recent inflation and employment data should provide the foundation for accommodative Federal Reserve policy actions later this year and into 2025. I encourage you to read more on this as discussed in the CEO commentary and market perspective, released earlier today. Beyond 2024, we expect the generational highway and street investments as the nascent reshoring and artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out are very much expected to provide an extended multiyear construction cycle in these aggregates intensive end markets. Equally, when the affordability headwinds recede, we fully expect an accelerated housing construction recovery, specifically in single family, which will be required to address the structural deficit of homes in many of Martin Marietta's key markets. Importantly, as history informs us, growth in single-family construction bodes well for light non-residential activity, which typically follows with a lag, but in this instance, a lag, which we believe will be more abbreviated than previous cycles. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and shown in today's release, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint, reflecting our first half results and revised second half shipment expectations. In the second quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 3% and gross profit of $501 million, a decrease of 7%. The decline in both metrics is attributable to the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and related concrete businesses as well as shipment declines experienced in the quarter, most notably due to wet weather, partially offset by contributions of the Albert Frei & Sons and Blue Water acquisitions. The net positive impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the second quarter was $7 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our aggregates pipeline established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit as contributions from acquired operations and strong pricing more than offset lower shipments. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 9% to a second quarter record of $7.41. That number is inclusive of the $20 million or $0.37 per ton non-recurring, non-cash purchase accounting impact of the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition, which was fully recognized in the second quarter. Excluding this purchase accounting impact, gross profit per ton increased 14%. These impressive results reveal and affirm how our disciplined commercial strategy and flexible cost structure yields higher profits despite lower volumes. Cement and concrete revenue decreased 37% to $261 million, and gross profit decreased 44% to $72 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas Cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily, by significant wet April, May and early June weather in Dallas-Fort Worth. Notably, our strategic Midlothian cement plants daily shipping rates returned to near sold-out levels exiting the quarter. Remember, too, we expect our new finish mill [ph] to be operational in the third quarter, which has the capacity to add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Our asphalt and paving revenues and gross profit increased modestly to $245 million and $37 million, respectively, both second quarter records in large measure due to pricing improvements and energy cost tailwinds. Magnesia Specialties revenues of $81 million were in line with the prior year quarter, while gross profit decreased 2% to $27 million. Strong pricing, improved maintenance cost management and energy cost tailwinds, counterbalance lower chemicals and lime shipments. SOAR has long provided the framework we use to grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. During the first half of this year, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates acquisitions, invested $339 million of capital into our business and returned $542 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the second quarter alone, we repurchased 530,000 shares at an average price of $566 per share. Since our repurchase authorization announced in February 2015, we returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2 times as of June 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, providing balance sheet strength and ample flexibility to actively pursue our M&A pipeline, reinvest in our business and extend our long track record of returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders, all while preserving financial flexibility and our investment-grade credit rating profile. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim. In 2024, Martin Marietta is proudly celebrating our 30th year as a publicly-traded company. Our three decades of success has been the result of an unwavering commitment to safety and the disciplined execution of our proven strategy. As we plan for the next 30 years, we're confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to continue leading our industry's evolution while at the same time, navigating through inevitable macroeconomic cycles and driving sustainable, attractive growth. We remain committed to building and maintaining the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led business and look forward to delivering superior shareholder value for our stakeholders for years and decades to come. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. The first is focused on Q2 and just better understanding the impact of how much of it was market, maybe more color on the volume impact in the quarter? And then part and parcel with that, how should we think about the balance of Q3 and Q4 in terms of how profitability should flow through, given some of the obvious weather content you and your peers have been facing? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Good morning, Kathryn, thank you for the question. So look, weather was a big deal in Q2, there's no doubt about it. So I said in the prepared remarks that it was 119% weather in DFW this year than it was last year. And the fact is if you look at what happened in North Texas all by itself, but then you couple that with what happened in the Central division. And what I suppose is most people don't think about the Central division as being impactful to us as it is. Really, if we're looking at Dallas itself and the Central division together, those two areas of business typically represent nearly 40% of our Q2 shipments. So if we're looking at significant rain in Dallas and significant rain and flooding in the Midwest, that was really a serious body blow to the business. And what I like about that is it took that blow and came in with record aggregates profitability, record unit profitability and did all of that taking on the $20 million of inventory fair markup that we've totally absorbed in Q2. So seeing what happened in Dallas was important, understanding what happened in the Midwest was important. But I was also taken with the resiliency of our cement business in North Texas. Again, we've long defined what equals strategic cement for us. And clearly, what we have in that market is just that. I mean, we saw organic shipment volumes down about 18%, and again, that was all driven by rain, but pricing up nearly 10% and with very, very good performance. And as Jim indicated in his comments, we were seeing that marketplace turn to near sold-out levels as soon as the rain abated. So those were issues, I think, 50% at least of what we saw in the quarter was attributable to rain. Do I think a portion of it was attributable to the economy? Yes, probably 25% of it. So what am I seeing there? It's really what we indicated private construction because of what's happening with interest rates are seeing degrees of modest pullback. But the important thing to remember there, Kathryn, is we don't see markets that are overbuilt today in Martin Marietta marketplaces. So we feel like that's going to be fleeting. But equally, value over volume cost us some tonnage during the quarter. But the fact is we're perfectly okay with that. Again, we monitor that. We're going to be thoughtful around it. But again, we're seeing continued expanded adjusted EBITDA margins in what we're doing. We feel like the breakdown we've had between weather at 50%, market at 25% and value over volume at about 25% makes sense. But the other part of your question went to the cadence of how we think about the quarters. Let me turn that over to Jim to talk you through that a bit because that is going to change modestly.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. Last year, Kathryn, second half of the year, about 60% of consolidated EBITDA came through in Q3 and 40% came through in Q4. Because of what we're seeing this year with weather, et cetera, in July and even August, the split is probably closer to 55% Q3, 45% in Q4, so a little bit more Q4 weighted this year than normal.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay. Perfect. And just one follow-up, if I may. Just on the outlook when you look at backlogs or jobs in the Q. What are you seeing in terms of project types and how are -- how is pricing on these type of projects, which obviously play into margins? Thanks very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. Look, if we're looking at customer backlogs, they're up sequentially so they continue to build. Number one, I think that's important. Number two, if we're looking at the nature of the projects, look, infrastructure is going to be a good end use for several years, and we see that continuing. If we're looking at non-res, we're seeing degrees of shifts there. And by the way, that's not a surprise to us. So are we seeing more factories? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good pricing that goes with that? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good steady work and growing work, frankly, relative to energy? The answer is yes. Are we seeing growing work relative to data centers for all the reasons that I indicated in the prepared remarks, and in the commentary that we published today, that continues to grow. Obviously, warehousing is not. That's not a surprise to anyone. And what we're seeing is you almost have 2 lanes of traveling. You have data centers in one lane and they're going in a positive direction, and warehousing is going in the other, and you're seeing those percentages almost past each other on a precise precision or percentage basis today. So that's the type of work that we're seeing. The other thing that we're beginning to see, and this is more in Georgia. It's in North Carolina. It's in South Carolina. We're seeing green shoots and degrees of single-family housing right now. And again, that's not a big surprise simply because of the population dynamics. And again, relative to housing, we're such a small portion of the overall housing that traditionally in single-family housing back to the essence of your question, that tends to be very attractive priced materials, Kathryn. So I hope that's helpful.
Kathryn Thompson: Thanks so much and best of luck.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Stanley Elliott: Hey good morning everyone. Nice work despite this difficult environment. Ward, could you maybe walk us through kind of the revised guide, some of the puts and takes and see maybe what will get us to the high end versus the low end just as we're sitting here today kind of halfway through the year?
Howard Nye: You bet. Happy to. And Stanley, thank you for your comments. We appreciate it. I'm with you. I think that was actually a very good performance, given what our team managed through. So several things. Let's start with pricing. So as you've seen, we've reaffirmed our pricing guide of 11% to 13% up, and that includes the previously announced midyears for California for the Frei business, for Blue Water locations as well as the targeted product and market-specific mid-years in other geographies. And by the way, that's pretty typical for us. The one thing that I think is going to be important this year relative to the midyears, so much volume that had already been bid at the January 1 pricing is still yet to go because of the deferral that we've seen. So typically, in a year, I've always told you historically. You could probably see about 1/4 of the midyears really show up in any given year in which they're put in. I think the midyears are going to be notably more impactful in '25. In other words, when we come back to you in January and talk about our guide for next year, I think you're going to see more mid-years affecting that this year than not. So that's how we're thinking about the ASP in the guide. Relative to volumes, clearly, that reflects an impacted first half results and early – other – here in the second half of the year. July was wet and we're sitting here today as tropical storm Debbie is going through the Carolinas. So we're living that. And so we're trying to take our experience with those events and really build that into the volume guide for the second half of the year. So we feel confident that we've hit that with as much clarity as we can given the circumstances. Look, relative to what will be expected as lower shipment levels. So our teams are going to be focused, as you would imagine, is too. Very much on cost control and making sure we're flexing our costs with demand. So we're very focused on that. The other thing that I think you'll see is given the inventory builds that we had with wet weather, where we're producing but not selling, there's going to be a little bit of inventory drawdown, and that's going to impact us a bit in half two. And it can provide a modest headwind to EBITDA. But again, we've taken that into account in what we put out there for you. One thing to keep in mind, too, is we're looking at the EBITDA guide, and I think this is something that's easy to forget. We grew EBITDA in 2023 by 33%. And I mean that's a really big number. And it gives you a difficult year compare. But at the same time, we're seeing EBITDA margin grow. And even at the guide, we're looking at a two-year CAGR of high teens, getting close to 17%, getting close to 20%. So again, numbers that we're very proud of, numbers that we feel good about as we're going into the second half of the year. And then at a foundation, particularly relative to pricing that we think puts us in a very attractive place as we start increasingly thinking about 2025, Stanley.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect, Ward. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck in the back half of the year.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your lines are open. Please ask your question.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I'll echo Stanley's comment about the good work in a tough environment.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Trey, very much.
Trey Grooms: So I guess I've got really -- the main one I wanted to talk about was kind of you've seen some slowing or maybe a little bit of deceleration you mentioned on the -- kind of on the activity front, in addition to weather, there was some of that. And Warden, you've broken out in the past, I think as recently as the last call, infrastructure and kind of your expectation for the year, I think, was kind of mid- to high single improvement. Res was I think, down low singles and non-res low singles to mid-single down. If we kind of look at your new view of the world and in light of kind of what we've seen with some of the activity out there. Is there any way you can kind of help us kind of bridge back these kind of expectations for these end markets relative to kind of what you were looking for?
Howard Nye: Sure. Happy to, Trey, and that's a great question. So if we think through it, I'll actually work from the bottom up. So we were previously in res, we were saying, look, res was going to be down low single-digits to mid-single-digits. So now as we see it look, we think it's going to be in mid. So we've gone to the lower end of the original guide, if you see it, I mean, relative to res. If we're looking at non-res, we had previously said, look, that's going to be down mid single-digits to high. So we've really taken the same view on that, that we have relative to res. We said that's going to be down high single-digits. Not because we think heavy is not going to be good. I think heavy is going to be increasingly good. These are going to be big jobs. It's going to take a little bit of time. But really, what we've done is – excuse me, we've looked at the public side of it. We had said we thought public would be up mid single-digits to high single-digits. We actually think that's now going to be modestly down, and it's more of a timing issue than anything else. Because part of what we're assuming is -- let's assume we're going to have a relatively normal weather calendar year this year. And if we go to businesses like the Central division, once we get toward late October, frankly, you're rolling the dice a little bit on whether you're going to have a good business. There won't be frozen weather impacted in November and December. So now we pulled back a bit on infrastructure. And, again, that's not work, Trey, as you know, that's going to go away. It's going to be work that's going to be pushed into 2025. And for a lot of reasons, we're perfectly okay with that. But relative to the guide and relative to the end users, I hope that puts the specificity around it, it will be helpful to you.
Trey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. That was perfectly helpful. Just one last one, if I could sneak one in. I think you mentioned that the integration of Blue Water and Albert Frei & Sons are complete. And it sounds like they're performing at least as good as your expectations if not better. If you could maybe go a little bit more comments about kind of where you're seeing the outsized benefits or where they're exceeding expectations? And also just on the pipeline. I mean, you just completed two deals this year, one pretty big one. Do you think we should -- what's the pipeline look like? And do you think we should be looking for more kind of tuck-in deals, given that recent M&A activity you've been doing? Or could there still be the potential for some chunky deals out there for you guys?
Howard Nye: Great questions, Trey. So thank you for all of that. So we'll start with both Blue Water and Al Frei relative to integration. So you're right. I mean from our perspective, those integrations are done. They have been tucked in. They are pure bolt-ons. Our integration process is extraordinarily efficient. And we discussed that before. We typically integrate the back office systems and processes and onboard people literally over the course of a weekend. So our intention is typically to close on a Friday and do a lot of training over the course of the weekend, open Monday and have people going over our scales, getting Martin Marietta tickets and having them in our systems, and that's exactly what happened. So as we think about what's happening with those businesses now, operationally, they're performing really very well, number one. Number two, these are folks who know that they've got a forever home right now. I mean, we're an aggregates-led business. They're delighted to be a part of Martin Marietta. Number three, their safety numbers have been extraordinary. I mentioned in my opening commentary, that from an incident rate perspective, this was the safest quarter that Martin Marietta has ever had. And to be able to say that after we've done the degree of acquisitions that we've done, in my view, is pretty extraordinary. Now if we think about what continued synergy realization is going to look like, several things. Number one, we will continue to invest responsibly in these businesses and fixed plant rolling stock, et cetera, and we think that will continue to make the businesses more efficient. But equally important, the pricing at those locations is actually notably below Martin Marietta corporate average. By that, I mean, let's call it, $4-plus a ton. So if I go back to the commentary that we had on targeted mid-years and the fact that they're coming through the way that we would have expected on the acquisitions, that's going to give us continued near-term upside on those businesses. We think that's likely to persist for a number of years. Operationally, they will continue to get better for a while. So we think there's going to be goodness that's going to be coming to us from Blue Water, from the Albert Frei & Sons, by the way, from the continued acquisitions in California and Arizona for a while yet. Now, that leads into the second part of your question, that is, what does the pipeline look like? And the pipeline continues to look attractive. The pipeline continues to be almost entirely pure aggregates businesses. And they tend to be a bit of a blend of what you said. Some of them have a little bit of chunkiness to them. A lot of them are nice tuck away transactions. We hope we'll have more for you on some of that as the year goes on. As you know, between what's going in and what's gone out this year, we've done well over $4 billion worth of transactions. But if we're sitting at a net leverage of 2 times as of June 30th, as you know, that gives us ample dry powder to continue doing what I think is really a core competency for Martin Marietta, and that is doing M&A and doing it well. M&A is something that's in our DNA, and we're very proud of that. So, Trey, thank you for that second question. I hope that cleared some of those items up too.
Trey Grooms: Yes, great color. Thanks Ward. Best of luck.
Howard Nye: Take care.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please ask your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi good morning.
Howard Nye: Good morning Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I wonder if I can just ask you conceptually right this year, you folks had excellent pricing based on the volumes that we're seeing from everyone across the board, you haven't had to succeed market share to get this level of pricing, we're seeing stubborn inflation across repair and maintenance and elsewhere, how does that impact. How you're thinking about 2025, obviously, we can't count on a volume ramp back up. So, I'm wondering, based on what you're seeing and the receptivity of price increases and inflation. I guess what are the prospects for potential double-digit pricing year again in 2025 based on everything you've seen year-to-date?
Howard Nye: But obviously, we'll give you more of a definitive guide on that as we go into next year. But Jerry, as I think about the building blocks for what we have, I think infrastructure is going to stay very attractive. I think housing in our markets has more than found bottom. I think that's going to get attractive. I think heavy non-res is and is going to stay attractive. As I indicated in the commentary, I think the lag we've typically seen between non-res on the light side and res is going to be abbreviated, I think that sets us up for a really attractive 2025 and beyond relative to pricing. From my perspective, the pricing that you have seen in Martin Marietta for 30 years as a public company that I think you would look at and say, historically has looked really good. Frankly, you're seeing a step change. And I think the step change is appropriate. But for a number of reasons, and among others, is people now are starting to think about this business on what is replacement cost look like for these hugely valuable reserves. I mean if we look at the reserves we have today, seven-plus years at current extraction rates is a significant body of reserves. At the same time, I don't think that we should be punished for having the discipline and having the vision to make sure that we've got adequate reserves. So, does that tell me? And does that help inform you that we think pricing will continue to be at what I think will be new levels. And probably in that ZIP code of what you're talking about, I think the answer is yes. It probably will. And again, we'll come back with more definitiveness on that in February, but I would not encourage you to think about it materially differently.
Jerry Revich: Super. And can I ask you, Jim, in terms of the midpoint of the aggregates gross profit and top line parameters. It looks like on a year-over-year basis, you're guiding to about two points of gross margin expansion back half 2024 versus back half 2023, which is better than in the first half. Is that right? And can you unpack the drivers behind that, if that's the case, how much of that is the mid-years in Tennessee and California, et cetera, that's driving the acceleration in the outlook?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. No, you're right, those ballpark numbers are correct. The star of the show, as always, has been growing ASP. So that's flowing through in the second half of the year. That's the primary metric that's driving that improved margin, Jerry. Secondary impact is, as I mentioned in prior calls, inflation is abating. It's moderating as the year goes on. So the cost pressures are by and large, coming back down, not to where they were at pre-COVID, of course, but 5% to 6% on baseline cost inflation. So those two things are the main driver.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please ask your question.
Anthony Pettinari: Hi. Good morning.
Howard Nye: Hi Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: Hey, Ward, could you talk a little bit more about maybe state funding environments as you think about next 12 months in fiscal 2025. I think there was some data that suggested general fund spending for the states could be down in fiscal 2025 after a number of years of very strong growth. Obviously, that's not one-to-one to DOT spending. But just wondering, if you could kind of walk through the states and where you're maybe the most excited and seeing some growth versus which could be wider kind of as you think about the next 12 months?
Howard Nye: No. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it very much. So let's just two march together. So look, if we're looking at Texas DOT lettings, for FY 2024, lettings forecast of $13.7 million. That's up 17% from the year before. But equally, if we're looking to see where they are next year, again, they're looking to be up over that next year. If I'm looking at Colorado, they passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill. And that basically ensures consistent stream of DOT funding beginning in 2023, and that's going to go on for several years. And we expect, even going into 2025 that Colorado DOT is going to have at least $3.7 billion available to spend. And that's going to be a really attractive budget. If we're looking here in the backyard in North Carolina, we expect their budget to increase to $7.6 billion for FY 2025. Again, that's an increase over prior year. And part of what's notable there, keep in mind, North Carolina started looking at different ways to fund their infrastructure a few years ago. And from 2025 thereafter, they're going to be using sales taxes at about 6% to fund infrastructure work here in North Carolina. That's going to make a nice difference. Equally, if we look at Georgia, their 2025 budget of $4.2 billion, that's a 7% increase over where it was in 2024. And this one is interesting to me, even if we look at Florida, Florida's budget, if you look at a top side, looks like it's going down. But that's only because FY 2024 had about $2.1 billion of one-time supplements that were in it. So if we're looking at a base budget in Florida of about $15.1 billion, we're looking at what we think is a base in FY 2025, of about $15.5 billion. The punchline is this, if we go and look at our top 10 states, Texas is up, Florida is up from a base budget perspective, North Carolina is up, Indiana is up, Georgia is up, Colorado is up, Arizona is up, and Texas is up. So really, there are two states that are down. One is Minnesota. It's going from $4.5 billion to about $4 billion. And to put that in some context, Minnesota is going to have a DOT budget next year that's rivaling it back where Georgia is. I don't think that's a bad place for Minnesota to be. And California is going to be modestly down. And I think that's simply in keeping with what we see more broadly in the California budgeting process. But again, if I look at these top 10 states, it looks awfully attractive to me. But equally, when I look at the highway contract awards over a period of time, like if we go back to, let's call it, midyear 2022 on an LTM basis and look at where it is this year, in June on an LTM basis, it's up 25%. And that's the step change that we thought we would see on contract awards. And again, part of SOAR that Jim referenced in his comments, dictated where we wanted to be and one of the places we wanted to be are places that had good, long, durable DOT budgets and had people moving those states so they would have the imperative to continue to invest. And as we look at how those state DOT budgets look today and how they're going to look more importantly to your question tomorrow, we have a lot of confidence about that and have a very attractive outlook as we contemplated. So Anthony, I hope [indiscernible].
Anthony Pettinari: No, that's extremely helpful. I'll turn it over. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.
Angel Castillo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to drill in a little bit more on the kind of 25% of the volume that decline was maybe more related to kind of the price over volume strategy. Could you just talk about is there any sense for kind of what market that may be occurring more and or some of the competitive dynamics that might be driving that versus kind of a greater or increasing kind of discipline toward price over volume?
Howard Nye: You know what it was interesting because I took that same deep dive that you're trying to do intellectually just to make sure that there wasn't some overriding trend or something that we need to be concerned about or alarmed by, and it wasn't. I mean as you recognize and we do too, markets in our world tend to be an MSA because of the weight to price ratio that I spoke of in the CEO commentary. The material often doesn't travel very far. And what we see on occasion is somebody can be aggressive. Somebody can be long on any given product. There can be just a whole host of things that can drive different degrees of behavior in different markets. So we're not seeing anything that's overwhelming in any one market that causes us any concern. Obviously, we've stated a preference for value over volume. We believe in that. We see it in the numbers. We believe that it's proving its efficacy and what we're seeing in the financial results. At the same time, we're always going to be thoughtful around are we pushing too hard on occasion and are we losing too much. And so it's a process we do go through. It's a dialogue that we do have here in this office, but more importantly, have it with our division presidents and VP GMs. So there's no one area that if I were you, I would look at and have any concern about, obviously, I don't want to talk about specific markets per se. It was really more of a weather event than anything else, degrees of softening and then here or there on pricing. But Angel, that's the best way that I can guide you to think about it right now.
Angel Castillo: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on the cement business. You talked about that returning to kind of being close to full sold out in the quarter or, I guess, [indiscernible] the third quarter. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color or remind us how we should kind of be thinking about the flow through of the expansion in terms of ramp-up of volumes, and how you kind of see the profitability of that business has to be kind of normalized from these weather impacts?
Howard Nye: Sure. So, I'll do a couple of things. One, I'll ask Jim to speak to the capital project that we have underway, and he can give you a bit more on that and the 450,000 tons that will be added through that, because we'll be thoughtful around the way that we do it. But obviously, if we're just looking at what happened relative to the weather in DFW, that was the driver pure and simply. I mean that took organic shipments down about 18%. But again, pricing was up 9.5%. And part of what we saw in that business is we actually saw gross margins expand in that business. And that's one reason that we speak to what we've long called strategic cement. It's where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a downstream business, and we do in Dallas, that takes about 30% of what we're doing there. And its ability to be interdicted by waterborne imports is really quite minimal. And so if we look at what strategic cement for us is, it's Midlothian. If we look at how the pricing behaved, it behaved well. despite the fact that organic shipments were down, we still expanded gross margins, which is why we want to invest capital in that market. And for that, let me turn to Jim, and he can give you a sense of where we are in that process and how we think about volume.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So that project, the finish mill 7, as we call it, will be completed this quarter. As you know, it's 450,000 tons per year of annual production capacity. So give or take, 110-ish thousand ton per quarter. We won't hit the market with that full speed on day one. We'll be responsible about feathering in those volumes to ensure we don't disrupt the commercial strategy we've been following in that marketplace. So more to come on when that comes out, but that will be helpful to us, a, in terms of volume, but also more importantly, operational flexibility, wait time for customers, storage facilities, our ability to react to different events is enhanced as a result of this project. So we're looking for this to improve margins going forward and of course, volumes as those become available to us.
Howard Nye: Angel, the last part of your question was what do we see happening in volumes here as the quarter ended? And I think we indicated as weather got better in Dallas Fort Worth, we were back to near sold-out conditions at Midlothian. So, I think that puts a bow around it.
Angel Castillo: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Zack Pacheco: Good morning. It's actually Zack Pacheco on for Garik this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate you guys walking through the outlook on state funding moving forward, a couple of questions to go, maybe just to dive into that real quickly. We've been hearing other siding inflation kind of eating into those IIJA base dollars, therefore, causing some delays. Just curious if you guys are seeing that at all, or are the base dollars truly just flowing through nicely? Thanks.
Howard Nye: I think we'd be naive to assume the degrees of inflation haven't eaten into that. And so when we went back over time, I've said before, whatever the volume that people thought would come out of IIJA, the year it was signed in the law. Have you seen some of that being eroded by inflation? Yes, I think so. But at the end of the day, very selfishly from a Martin Marietta perspective, would we trade the volume that we see for the pricing that we're seeing? The answer is yes. I think part of what's so important to keep in mind too is I don't think IIJA is a one-hit wonder. In other words, I think we simply changed the floor in the way that the United States Congress and the government will continue to invest in infrastructure because keep in mind, we went 1.5 decades with woefully under-funded infrastructure. So I think in many respects, yes, some degree of volume has been taken out simply because of inflation. At the same time, I believe when we see a reauthorization of this act, we're likely to see something at/or above where this is. And again, it would provide a nice extended period of time for the United States to invest in this much-needed infrastructure. At the same time, it will allow us to make sure that we're getting the appropriate return for our very valuable materials that are in the ground and that we work hard to turn into a spec product. So that's the way that we think about it. There's nothing per se new in that, but I think it's important to be able to articulate that to the investing public, because I think from our perspective, it works.
Zack Pacheco: No, that makes sense. Thanks.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of Truist. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Questions back in cement. To your point, tremendous pricing, the best pricing increase I've seen during this earnings season from cement. Now the Midlothian is back to sold out, is there going to be further increases this calendar year? Or is that something we'll have to contemplate for next year?
Howard Nye: No. Look, we've certainly told the market that we are looking to have another dialogue in September. Obviously, it's not yet September. So we'll have to see how that goes, Keith. But again, there are a lot of different cement markets across the United States. And Dallas is a really good cement market. And, obviously, Dallas had a strange market in Q2 simply because it was wet. But when Martin Marietta was buying TXI back in 2014 and 2015, I remember very clearly what I said to our Board of Directors at the time, and that was -- I felt like Dallas-Fort Worth might well be the single most attractive heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 years. It has not disappointed. So have we told our customers that we're going to have a dialogue in September? Yes. Am I ready to tell you what that's going to look like? The answer is no. But in any event, to your point, as I've watched public data come out, I concur with your conclusion, I haven't seen a market that has reacted more attractively than DFW has on pricing on a percentage basis.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Keith.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please ask your question.
Adam Thalhimer: Good morning guys. Share repurchases. That was a really heavy pace in the first half of the year. Curious how we should read that and what the outlook is?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. Well, simply, there's a couple of things that go into that. One is we are well-below our target leverage ratio. And we had entered the year with the quarter with over $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. So that was part of it. But, of course, we thought the stock price was at an attractive level as well. We thought it was under undervalued. So that's really -- it's as simple as that. We're pretty opportunistic about our stock buyback, Try to avoid a lazy balance sheet at the same time, and those things just coalesce this quarter.
Adam Thalhimer: Thanks, Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is actually Collin [ph] on for Phil. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the aggregate volume guide. What is baked into the aggregate 1% to 4% decline from an organic perspective? And how are you thinking about those organic trends in the back half of the year here, just given the wet start to the third quarter and maybe some of the softer trends that you're seeing in the warehouse office and resi markets that you called out.
Howard Nye: Yeah. Thanks, Collin. Thanks for the question. We try at this point now that those operations are really fully integrated. I wanted to break some out for the quarter because we were going through the integration process, but now that they're fully integrated, we just think about it candidly at this point is all organic going forward. I mean, clearly, I gave some, I thought, helpful color relative to end users and what we thought the shifts are going to be relative to up, down, sideways, et cetera. But again, if we're looking at the second half of the year on infrastructure, we think it's going to be a busy second half of the year. At the same time, the biggest things that we're trying to get our heads around is what we're navigating right now and what will be the fallout from, as I said, what, July and what has so far been a wet August with the hurricane making its way literally from somewhere between Myrtle Beach and Charleston right now, eventually up through the Greensboro High Point area. So those are more of the swing factors in the near term and in the longer term, this year, to the extent there can be longer term this year, it's really going to be more driven by when winter sets in and what the effects of that may be in certain markets. So I can remember years that we were doing asphalt and paving in Colorado in December. That doesn't happen very often, but it does happen. And those will be your swing factors really as we think about volumes but more granularly as we think about infrastructure.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And just one follow-up question. I guess if we see some more accommodating monetary policy here in the back -- later this year, how quickly do you start -- do you think that starts to show up in your shipments?
Howard Nye: I think it starts to show up reasonably early in 2025 because I do think in portions of private, particularly in homebuilding, et cetera, you've got the pent-up demand. And it's interesting as we have people looking to move to Raleigh, one of the issues that they chronically run into. And by the way, I'm using Raleigh as an example, but we could go across our footprint and say the same thing. The inventories is really very low. And frankly, from our perspective, that's a pretty high-class problem, Collin. Is it tough for people moving to the area because they can't find a home that they want? Yes. Does it mean, however, that once you have that more accommodating policy that you're going to see homebuilders moving, we think, with alacrity to fill what's a needed hole right now. We think that's the case. And that tends to be, particularly if they've made the investment in land, which in many instances they have, that they can move relatively quickly and keep in mind a portion of what we're going to capture as residential will be those streets. It will be that curb and gutter. It will be the sidewalks. It will be the utilities until those subdivisions are turned over to the local municipality for maintenance. So what we see on the resi side, I think so, does that mean that you're going to see light non-res come behind it in that more abbreviated period, I think so. And all that underlies what we think will be a continuing attractive infrastructure setting. So again, I hope that's helpful.
Unidentified Analyst: It is. Thank you for the color.
Howard Nye: You bet, Colline.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please ask your question.
Joe Nolan: Hey. Good morning. This is Joe Nolan on for David. You touched on COGS briefly, but I was just hoping you could provide an updated cost outlook for the year and discuss some of the moving parts within that. You also mentioned your focus on controlling costs. I guess I was just wondering, what are some of the areas that you can focus on with cost-cutting measures in a softer market?
Howard Nye: So happy to, Jim, you want to ahead and take the first and I'll come back on where we're focused?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. So the full year guide on COGS per ton it's -- well, second half rather to be more precise is up 7% second half of this year versus second half last year. It's reflective of, again, general inflation slowly coming down. There's a little bit of under-absorption in that as well as the volumes come down versus their old -- our old view. Then the repairs and maintenance costs have remained elevated. We've seen some improvement as we -- as volumes have come down on contract services. The outsourced services have been reduced, lower over time. And of course, we do have a bit of diesel tailwind built in, so that's helpful too.
Howard Nye: Well, I think Jim really hit very, very nicely, a, what the percentages look like; b, what the emphasis is going to be. Obviously, we're going to be focused on maintenance and repairs because we've seen those up disproportionately. But we're also seeing general inflation come down. We are seeing some nice tailwinds coming from portions of energy. It's been a bit of a bifurcated situation, though, because we've seen diesel clearly better. We've seen electric modestly up. But again, managing our hours managing our over time, keeping our people safe will be areas that we will have a unique focus as we always do in the second half of the year. But I think you will see a better trend on repairs in particular.
Joe Nolan: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Howard Nye: You bet. Good to talk to you, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please ask your question.
Tyler Brown: Hey, good morning. You talked a little bit about this earlier. But if I'm not mistaken, in conjunction with Blue Water, there was a notice of a July 15 midyear. I believe you had already communicated midyear's out West early in the year. So I'm just curious though, when you look at the portfolio, just how close are prices how West's recently acquired operations to being harmonized to your heritage markets? Because I assume your heritage markets are also price increasing. So do you feel like there's still some catch-up work there? And why wouldn't this be a sizable tailwind to pricing over the next few years just as you harmonize that whole portfolio?
Howard Nye: So Tyler, thank you for the question. So I would say two things. One, we are getting closer. We are getting ever closer to harmony in the Western U.S. So pretty soon, you can start humming that music. I think that's going to be there. But here's the other thought that I would have for you I'm not sure we're looking for harmony in the West. I think the West ought to be a price leader because as we look at the cost of doing business in California as we look at barriers to entry in California, just a host of things. The West Coast businesses should never, in my view, have been businesses priced below a Martin Marietta heritage number. And I think there should be a premium associated with businesses in that geography, because you've got at times some premium costs associated with that geography. Now, to the rest of your question, should there be recovery in places like Tennessee and elsewhere as we continue to go through the synergy realization process of the Blue Water operations. The answer is yes, there should be. And as I indicated, I think in some of my earlier commentary, there's over $4 a ton delta right now between the average in those locations and heritage Martin Marietta. So to your point, should there be an extended period of goodness in that. The answer is yes because, obviously, the heritage footprint or price profile will continue to go up as we continue to move up at the Blue Water operations as well and get those closer to that harmony point that we spoke of before. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me as I look at our portfolio that North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee would or should look materially different. And that's where we're endeavoring to take the business.
Tyler Brown: Yes. Excellent. Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen.
Howard Nye: Good morning.
Michael Dudas: Did notice in the presentation that the Magnesia outlook is up for 2024 relative to the expectations. So maybe spend a little bit on a minute on that business? And is there any reads or indications on general economic or business activity that can be helpful to thinking about how that business flows over the next several quarters?
Howard Nye: Happy to. And it's really a tale of two different businesses there. So if we're looking just at revenues, as Jim said in his comments, they were relatively flat. Now as we look at that, chemicals up around 7%, lime though, up 24%. And what we're seeing is pricing gains are more than offsetting lower chemical shipments. So chemical markets around the world. And keep in mind, this is not just a regional business. This is a business that we cover the US and we have double-digit international business there as well. So we obviously saw volumes down, we saw pricing up. So you're seeing a lot of the same dynamics in the Magnesia Specialties business that we're seeing overall in the aggregates business as well. Part of what I'm pleased with is steel utilization levels are remaining just above the 70% historical average, that's not a terribly high number. And what our team has been able to do there is several fold. One, control costs really well. Number two, they're going about their commercial strategy in a fundamental fundamentally different way. That's been a business that historically has had longer-term contracts, and they've been in a position revisit those contracts, reset them and make sure that, again, same circumstances aggregates. We've got long-lived reserves at our facility in Woodville, Ohio. We have long-lived brine reserves in Manistee, Michigan. At the same time, we need to be getting good value for those. And Chris Sanborski and his team have managed both sides of that business, controlling costs well and controlling pricing really well. And the EBITDA numbers that we're seeing in that business based on the volume in that business. Frankly, looks fundamentally different today than it would have two or three years ago under the same economic circumstances. So I'm very pleased with that business. The other thing that I'll say, too, it wasn't part of your question, but I think it underscores the efficiency of the business. Their safety numbers have also gotten notably better. And you just see that business going in a direction that we're very pleased with. And what's probably one of the tougher economies that any sector of our business is dealing with. And they're likely to come in with a record EBITDA year this year. And that's the type of performance in this setting that makes us really excited about what Martin Marietta is going to look like in 2025, 2026, 2027, et cetera.
Michael Dudas: Excellent. Appreciate that work. Thank you.
Howard Nye: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.
Timna Tanners: Hi. Good morning. One remaining one from us, if I could.
Howard Nye: Good morning, Timna.
Timna Tanners: Good morning. I actually just -- I wanted to touch on the comments you had earlier about interest rates, and I want to ask something similar, but about the election because we are hearing that there's some pause in activity around the election. And so curious about that, but also if you could dive into maybe any risk to some of the IRA-related projects, especially as they relate to EV demand and given the potential outcome of the election? Thanks.
Howard Nye: So Timna, thank you so much. What we're not seeing -- I don't think we're seeing a real slowdown in public relative to the election. So I think that just chugs along. I think that can have an effect on private. And I think that's probably some of what we've seen in the first half of this year. So I think that's probably just more of the same. Relative to public and what that could look like on IIJA reauthorization or the Inflation Reduction Act or otherwise. Yes, I would say several things. One, I think we're relatively agnostic. And here's why, Timna. Look, I think if you have a democratic administration that's in power this next time. My guess is IIJA looks pretty similar on a reauthorization basis and then you continue to see things like the Inflation Reduction Act. I think if you have a Republican administration, honestly, you probably have a more amped up infrastructure law and probably less IRA. And again, from our perspective, they're probably almost awash, and again, if we're looking at where the big investments are going to be made in highways, bridges, roads and streets, it's going to follow where people are. It's going to be driven by what's happening with DOT budgets, and it's going to be happening driven by what happens at the ballot box, where most of these places that are seeing big population trends continue to pass initiatives at well over 80% rates of passage, and we think that's going to endure. Frankly, if we've looked at the last several elections and you look at what's passed, almost half of it tends to be in Texas. And again, it goes back to building that marketplace that we have in Dallas Fort Worth and San Antonio and in Houston. And again, relative to what we see going on in energy and otherwise, I think that can move around a little bit depending on whether we have regime change. But if you build your businesses the way that we have on major commerce corridors, that's where the activity is going to be, whether it's factories, whether it's industrial, whether it's energy or otherwise. And that's why the positions we have along the I-85 corridor, the I-95 corridor, the I-25 corridor, the I-35 corridor and the I-5 corridor are so important to us. And keep in mind, Timna, we're the largest shipper of crushed stone on the railroads for a reason. We're the largest shipper of stone on BNUP. Number one on CSX, number two on Norfolk Southern and now number one on the Canadians after they bought the Kansas City Southern. And to the extent that this industrial buildout continues on either commerce by truck or commerce by rail, we're going to be well suited by that. And I think that's why from an election perspective, we're relatively agnostic and I think we're going to be good either way, and we love that durability.
Timna Tanners: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Operator: We do not have any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye.
Howard Nye: Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has built a durable and resilient business poised to continue outperforming through dynamic macroeconomic cycles. Our compelling underlying fundamentals, dedicated teams, well-defined strategic plan, carefully curated coast-to-coast footprint in the country's fastest-growing markets and unparalleled attractive growth opportunities reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2024 results with your fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website.
 I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms.  Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin. 
Jacklyn Rooker: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.
 Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.
 As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website.
 Ward and I will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our first quarter operating performance and our recently completed transactions as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to 1 question.  
 I will now turn the call over to Ward. 
C. Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta's continued growth and results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined adherence to and execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan.  
 With the nadir, that is always the industry's first quarter concluded in the 2024 construction season meaningfully underway, we remain confident that steady product demand supporting favorable commercial dynamics continued adherence to our value over volume strategy, ongoing operational excellence undertakings and portfolio optimizing transactions will position Martin Marietta for continued outperformance in 2024 and beyond.
 As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range to $2.30 billion to $2.44 billion or $2.37 billion at the midpoint. This increase reflects the benefits that will be realized from the recently acquired Blue Water operations as well as strong realization of this year's pricing actions. As is customary, we'll revisit our guidance again at midyear.
 Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, we've executed $4.5 billion of portfolio-enhancing transactions this year, reducing cyclical downstream exposure while redeploying the proceeds to expand our aggregates footprint and improve our ability to generate consistently higher margins. More specifically, on January 12, we completed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, strengthening our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area.
 And on April 5, we acquired 20 aggregate operations from Blue Water Industries providing us a new growth platform in Tennessee and Florida. These 2 pure-play aggregates transactions are expected to add approximately 17 million tons of annual shipments and generate approximately $180 million of annualized EBITDA, more than offsetting the EBITDA from the February 9 divestiture of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. These transactions are all reflected in our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance as of their respective closing dates.
 Turning now to the company's first quarter operating performance. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, increasing 12.2% or 12.7% on an organic mix adjusted basis, underscoring the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, and our sales team's unwavering commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. Aggregate shipments declined 12.3% due largely to the well chronic cold weather impacted start to the year in our East and Southwest divisions and softening demand in warehouse, office and retail construction partially offset by more favorable weather and relative strength in our Central and West divisions. Aggregates product line gross profit per ton increased 14% and gross margin expanded by 90 basis points notwithstanding the shipment decline.
 Looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end uses of Public Works, nonresidential and residential construction. More specifically, we believe these markets in Martin Marietta's chosen geographies will drive aggregates intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for the foreseeable future. We expect robust multiyear demand in public infrastructure, U.S.-based manufacturing, energy projects and data center construction will partially offset near-term softness in warehouse, light nonresidential and residential end markets. That said, we fully expect the housing recovery, particularly in single-family once affordability challenges subside as demand in our key markets remains robust.
 Infrastructure activity is expected to continue to grow in 2024 as early Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA projects advance to the major construction phase. Notably, according to the annual market outlook provided by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, public highway, batement and street construction, the largest market sector is expected to increase 16% to $126 billion in 2024 as compared with $109 billion in 2023 as record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, match federal funds and provide additional investments.
 The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand grew 11% to $116 billion for the 12-month period ending February 29, 2024. This generational investment in our nation's infrastructure supported by federal, state and local actions provides state DOTs with certainty to advance projects in their backlogs, driving sustained multiyear demand in this aggregate intensive often countercyclical market.
 Shifting to the heavy nonresidential market, manufacturing projects continue to be supported by steady demand from ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, Construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the February ceasing adjusted annual rate of spending for 2024 a $223 billion, a 32% increase from the February 2023 value of $169 billion. Equally, we expect the long-term secular trends towards cloud-based services and artificial intelligence will drive renewed growth in data center construction, which had moderated from a post-COVID peak.
 As an example, in March, Google announced a new $1 billion data center in Kansas City to help drive its artificial intelligence efforts, which requires nearly 800,000 tons of aggregates from our uniquely positioned underground operations.
 Looking at the light nonresidential market, we expect 2024 demand will be challenged given higher for longer interest rates, high office vacancy rates and the natural construction lag from the last 2 years of single-family residential declines. As for the residential market, despite near-term uncertainty around mortgage rates, we're encouraged by positive trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand, which were 1 million units in March 2024, a nearly 21% increase from a year ago.
 Notably, single-family housing starts have been at or above 1 million units since November 2023, indicative of a recovery from the 2023 trough. Given the well-publicized structural housing deficit in our company's key metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction once interest rates moderate and monthly mortgage payments become more affordable.
 I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter financial results. Jim? 
James Nickolas: Thanks, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and indicated in our earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBIT guidance to $2.37 billion at the midpoint and our full year 2024 aggregates gross profit guidance to $1.75 billion at the midpoint. The updated guidance for Aggregates gross profit includes a $30 million nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting impact expected in the second quarter the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition.
 The Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 8% and gross profit of $248 million, a decrease of 10%. The vast majority of the decline in both metrics is due to the effect of our divestiture of our South Texas cement and ready-mix business. A much smaller portion of the decline was due to shipments impacted by tougher weather this quarter compared to the prior year's unseasonably favorable weather conditions. Despite the lower shipment volumes, Aggregates gross profit increased modestly to $239 million, and gross margin increased 90 basis points to 27%. These results reflect our team's focus on what we can control specifically the efficacy of our commercial discipline and flexible cost structure, which drives higher profits without the benefit of growing volumes.
 Turning to our Texas cement and targeted downstream businesses. Our Cement and Concrete revenues decreased 22% to $265 million and gross profit decreased 47% to $31 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily by wet weather in Texas. Additionally, the new finish mill at our Midlothian cement plant in North Texas, which will add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity is still on track to be operational in the third quarter of 2024. Consistent with typical seasonal trends in relevant geographies, the asphalt and paving business posted a $22 million gross loss as our Minnesota-based asphalt facilities are inactive during the first quarter due to winter operational shutdowns and our Colorado-based operations experienced unfavorable winter conditions.
 Magnesia Specialties achieved an all-time quarterly gross profit record of $29 million despite a 3% decrease in revenues to $81 million as strong pricing, improved maintenance cost control and energy tailwinds more than offset continued headwinds in metal mining end markets. Our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities remain focused on responsibly growing our business through value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. In the first quarter, we invested $200 million of capital into our business. We also returned to shareholders almost $200 million during the quarter with $150 million of that used to repurchase over 255,000 shares at an average price of $586.85.
 Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x as of March 31. Assuming no further M&A activity, we expect net leverage to be 1.4x by year-end below our targeted range of 2.0 to 2.5x providing a strong balance sheet to capitalize on a robust acquisition pipeline. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. 
C. Nye: Jim, thanks so much. To conclude, we expect 2024 will be another year of significant achievement for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to benefit from infrastructure tailwinds, providing steady product demand and favorable commercial dynamics across our coast-to-coast footprint. Over the past 30 years, since the public company, Martin Marietta has built a resilient and durable business. We'll continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful an aggregates-led platform with an unwavering commitment to safety, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities.
 If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.
 All right. We're going to proceed with the next question. And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. 
Trey Grooms: Yes. Sorry about that for Kathryn. You all have clearly been very busy with acquisitions and overall portfolio optimization. And I know it's early days, but maybe if you could talk about kind of the integration of AFS and BWI. How that's going so far, maybe where you see opportunities there? And then with that, relative to the information you've given us in the past, I think you might be adjusting your view of the demand environment just a little bit, but taking up the ASP and maybe even the stand-alone EBITDA guide a bit. First off, do I have that right? And maybe could you help us out with that? 
C. Nye: You do have it right. And thanks for the questions. I'll try to do with all 3 parts. So let's talk first about integration, and your question is a good one. And look, you've -- we closed on Frei. We closed on Blue Water. The transactions went well. And the nice thing from our perspective, one, our teams have done this and done a lot and done it well. Number two, we typically close on a Friday, and we open up on Monday morning and it's a Martin Marietta operation. It has our signs, it has our tickets, they're on our networks, and that's exactly what we've seen. So again, the blocking, the tackling and the people integration is complete, and it's exactly where you would expect it to be based on our history.
 Now from a commercial excellence and operational excellence integration perspective, a couple of views on that. If we're looking at the commercial excellence, I mean, given the fact that we closed on Blue Water relatively quickly, number one, we were able to announce midyears in all of those markets effective July 15. And we generally ought to provide people with at least 90 days of notice to our customers. So again, the early closing of Blue Water worked to our advantage in that respect.
 With regard to operational excellence, several things that I think are worth noting, look, we look for quick wins. We're looking for suppliers. We're looking to spend more on favorable contracts that typically happens within the first 90 days without any incremental CapEx, we're seeing that. Longer term, we're obviously going to be looking at plant upgrades. We're looking at fleet modernization. And that typically takes some time, and it's got a CapEx component. And actually, one of the things that you'll see in the guidance is CapEx is up modestly, and that's up modestly because of things just like that in addition to what we feel like could be some opportunistic land purchases later.
 One thing relative to BWI in particular, keep in mind that was a carve-out. So no corporate SG&A came with that business. So it was already basically synergized from that perspective. So again, all of that has actually gone very nicely, Trey. The other piece of it that you mentioned, and you're right on if we're looking overall at volume, you remember when we came out at the year, not taking these transactions into account, we said we thought minus 2% to plus 2%. Midpoint was 0. What we're seeing now because of interest longer, really a bit of a weather-impacted start to the year.
 And the fact is if we look at 5 million tons down in Q1, if we parse that, several things worth noting. One, there were 3 less shipping days in this quarter than there were last year. That's probably about let's call that a couple of million tons by itself. But if we're looking then at the balance, which is quite about 3 million tons really, Trey. I mean about 1/3 of that was slower private, about 1/3 of that was weather, and about 1/3 of that is value over volume.
 So again, when we're taking those components into account, and we're looking at organic or heritage volume, but we think we're probably closer to the lower end of that original guide, let's call it down 2%, down 3%. And then what you're seeing in the new guide, takes the acquisitions effect into account. So hopefully, that gives you the bridge that you wanted, Trey. So I'll try to go through the integration components of it and then deal also with the volume bridge. Was there a piece of your question I did not respond to yet? 
Trey Grooms: Yes. Ward, the one thing was just, again, there's a lot of moving pieces here. But just based on some of the information you've given us in the past about BWI in particular, it seems like maybe you're just in that kind of stand-alone EBITDA guide up a bit. Do I have that right? 
C. Nye: No, we are. So if you look at the overall EBITDA midpoint, it's now $2.37 billion. Now that's 11% over where we were last year. So take that into account that basically, we're going to give you a year's worth of Blue Water in only 9 months. So that's one way to think of it. But the other thing that's important to state is we're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business as well. So we're getting a 2 for there. We're getting the benefit of Blue Water, by the way, which we think there's going to be more to come. We're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business you can see, among other things, we raised the aggregate pricing to 12% at the midpoint.
 So again, that's going to include some degree of midyear this year. And keeping in mind some of the difficulty that we have is if we're looking at pricing that was at Frei and pricing that was at Blue Water, their pricing was actually below Heritage Martin Marietta pricing. So the pricing that you're seeing and the changes that you're seeing are despite the overall headwind that we actually have from the new businesses that we brought in, Trey. So I hope that helps relative to the EBITDA range and what we're doing relative to pricing as well. 
Trey Grooms: Yes. Very helpful color, Ward. Very encouraging, and good luck for the rest of the year. 
Operator: And we'll be taking the next question again from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. 
Kathryn Thompson: Just a cleanup question from your prior answer, which was very helpful around guidance. Just a clarification, how much of the pricing guidance takes into account midyear pricing actions? And also any other factors that we should take into account given a change in mix from acquired and the opportunities for pricing with those acquisitions?
 And then finally, if I could just do one follow-on with Magnesia Specialties. While a small portion of EBITDA contribution, you had a very good quarter, what can we read through from a broader macro perspective on this business segment's outperformance? 
C. Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. So a couple of things. One, if we're looking at the pricing guide that we've given for the rest of the year, I mean here's the direct answer. It's got some mid years. It doesn't have everything that we believe we're going to see. So what does that mean? It means that now that we bought Blue Water, we've already indicated to those customers, they're going to get midyears. So we've built that in. As you may recall, coming into the year, we had indicated that we had not put it in guidance. We had already indicated to our customers in California that they were going to get midyears, that has been worked on.
 So there have been some very specific midyears that have been worked into the numbers that you see. So the numbers that you're seeing reflect 2 things: some very direct midyears, very nice realization of the beginning year increases that we put in. But the fact is, we still think we're going to see some more mid-years at midyear. So what that tells you is you should expect us to come back with more color on what that looks like. when we're reporting during the summertime. So that's the way I would ask you to think about that.
 Now relative to Mag Specialties, I would say several things. Number one, the chemical markets globally are still very difficult markets. Now that said, Mag just had its best quarter ever. So I'd say a couple of things are worth reading through on that. Number one is steel doing relatively well. It is. Is it blowing the doors off? It's not. So it tells us that business is actually performing quite well. So steel utilization is about at 72%. So if we're looking at the way that business is overall going, I'm actually very pleased with it.
 I think a read-through that you may be looking at is this. One of the things that we're seeing begin to recover nicely is TPO roofing. And that tells us now as we're looking at degrees of manufacturing and that manufacturing renaissance that we can look for across the United States that TPO roofing is what we're going to see in a lot of these data centers and a lot of these new battery plants and others. So typically, we're watching those products go into larger industrial uses. But when we're seeing TPO roofing recover, -- if you're looking for that read through, Kathryn, I don't think that's a bad read through. 
Kathryn Thompson: Very helpful. And best of luck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. 
Stanley Elliott: Ward, can you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing from an end market perspective? You mentioned about kind of some building into from a volume standpoint as we're kind of moving through the rest of the year. And I apologize if some of this was covered on some of the others. I've had some technical difficulties as well. But would love to kind of give some color on what's happening across the end market. 
C. Nye: Stanley, thank you for the question. Happy to do so. I mean, look, let's start with infrastructure, which is our single largest end use and an end use that we think is going to get nicely larger. Look, we see that up mid-single to high single digits this year for several reasons. One, you've got the bipartisan infrastructure law that's going to be coming in, in a meaningful way this year. Build into '25 even more meaningfully. So we see that working in a very significant way in a multi-year fashion. Keep in mind, too, we've got very healthy DOTs in our chosen geographies.
 If we're looking at our top 10 states, those budgets are up around 10% year-over-year. And last year, keep in mind, those budgets were pretty attractive. I mentioned in my prepared comments that if we're looking at the last 12 months highway, bridge and tunnel awards, those were up 12%. That's $116 billion versus $104 billion during the prior period. And the other thing that I think people forget is what's happening at local levels relative to ballot initiatives and what we saw last year were about $7 billion of transportation funding approved in 2023 that we'll see in the marketplace this year. So again, we think infrastructure looks attractive.
 If we're looking at non-res, our view is still largely the same. We think that's down probably mid-single digits, perhaps a little bit more. Keep in mind, of the portion of our business that is non-res. Around 55% of it is heavy non-res and about 45% of it is light non-res. And by the way, we think that's a pretty good break and we like the way that looks. Now if we're thinking about heavy, several things that worth keeping in mind. One, we put in the supplemental slides the fact that there's $53 billion worth of CHIPS Act money and about $250 billion of Inflation Reduction Act money that will be flowing through those sectors over the next several years. But what we're seeing more specifically is demand for heavy side energy and domestic manufacturing. That continues to be really resilient. And we think that's offsetting moderation in degrees of distribution and warehousing.
 Now where we are seeing some green shoots, and I think this is important, is in AI and in data centers. So for example, I mentioned Google is building a new facility in Kansas City. It's going to take about 800,000 tons but it's not just there. I mean, we're seeing it across the Midwest. We're seeing it in Omaha. We're seeing it in Des Moines. And we're going to be a disproportionate beneficiary of that due to the availability of land and wind power in those states where we actually have a very significant interest.
 Now light non-res is, in fact, in our view, going to be impacted near term by the high interest rates for longer and office vacancy rates. And I think that partly goes back to the commentary that I was having with Trey relative to what we see going on with organic volume. So that's certainly a piece of it. And resi, we see that down, let's call it, low single digits, maybe modestly higher than that. We think softness will persist there as we continue navigating this period of higher mortgage rates that's impacting affordability. I think clearly, people are thinking today that mortgage rates are going to remain higher than they would have thought in February. And I think that's part of the reality of it.
 But I do like the recent trends. I mean if we're looking at recent trends in single-family housing starts are encouraging because since last November, the starts have been at 1 million units, and that's a nearly 21% year-over-year increase, and we know the demand is going to have to be met with new construction. And again, if you take a look at the states with big population inflows I mean think about these states and think about Martin Marietta Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, et cetera. So far we think near-term single-family housing is going to be a modest headwind, we think long term, it's going to be really very attractive.
 So our view is if we look at infrastructure and think about how that's going to build multiyear, we look at res, think about how that's going to build multiyear look at the heavy side of non-res, we think that's going to continue to be very resilient. And we think the light nonres is going to come behind res most likely with that 6- to 9-month lag. So Stanley, I hope that helps. 
Stanley Elliott: Great color, Ward, and best of luck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. 
Anthony Pettinari: With the portfolio moves, it looks like you'll raise your aggregates mix from high 60s to high 70s in terms of gross profit. And my question is, is there kind of a long-term target percentage that you envision there and understanding you'll continue to grow aggregates organically and through acquisitions. I'm just wondering if you could talk about kind of the role you see Mag and the remaining cement assets playing in the broader portfolio? 
C. Nye: I'd say several things. Number one, we are an aggregates-led company, and we've always told people that's what you should expect us to be. And the moves that we have made are totally consistent with that. So should you expect to see aggregates number go up largely because I think we'll be buying relatively aggregates pure businesses? I think the answer to that question is yes.
 Equally though, if we pivot and talk about the other 2 businesses that you spoke up, remember, we've long spoken of the criticality of strategic cement. And we've said strategic cement is where we're an aggregates leader where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a significant downstream business, meaning ready-mix concrete, that takes a significant portion of the cement and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water.
 And the fact is that is precisely what Midlothian means to us. And one of the things that you will keep in mind, Anthony, we've got 450,000 tons worth of annual capacity that will be coming on at Midlothian this year in Q3. So we continue to invest in that business because we like that business, and we very much like being in that business in Dallas-Fort Worth.
 Equally, if you look at the Magnesia Specialties business, and keep in mind that's a business that we have about $100 million worth of investment in. That's a business that's going to make over $100 million a year. And frankly, it's a business that if we can find ways to responsibly grow it, they've earned that right because from a margin perspective, that's a hugely attractive business. So the way that we think of it, yes, is it aggregates led, you bet. Are we looking in particular at those 3 big upstream businesses is driving the vast majority of our revenues and profits.
 And the upstream businesses, meaning, number one, aggregates; number two, cement; number three, Mag specialties. So yes, you will see that aggregates percentage go up. And yes, your number was right. I mean we're sitting here today looking at gross profit from aggregates at about 77%. And if we look to where we were a year ago, it was somewhere sub-70%, closer to 69%. So expect that number to keep going up but I hope I've also outlined to you the way that we think about our very important and very good cement business in Dallas-Fort Worth and a high-performing Magnesia Specialties business as well. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. 
Jatin Khanna: Good morning, everyone. This is Jatin Khanna on behalf of Jerry Revich. From a portfolio standpoint, what has driven significant deal opportunities for you? And is there a scope for further asset refinement for the industry? What's the range of additional M&A that's feasible based on your pipeline? 
C. Nye: Thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, we have looked in the markets in which we want to grow and in the markets, most importantly, that we can grow. So we have several things that advantage is. Number one, the condition of our balance sheet. So if you look at our balance sheet, we are in a position that we can grow and we can continue to grow smartly. Number two, if you look at the transactions that we've done, I think you'll look at the transactions and say that we have done those in a wise and prudent fashion.
 If we look at businesses that we want to buy in markets in which we want to enter, by our math, we found businesses that on a per annum basis, produce and sell about 238 million tons of aggregates per annum. Here's the way to capture that. Basically, there's another Martin Marietta that's out there that we believe we have the ability over time to buy. Now can I sit here and tell you from a linear perspective exactly what that's going to look like? No, I can't.
 But can I tell you that I believe, economically, geographically, regulatorily and otherwise that we are uniquely positioned to do that, in my view, better than any other publicly held company in the United States. I believe that we are. And of course, I look at the world through Martin Marietta lenses, but I also believe that's a good clinical view of where we are. Our team is good at that. We're good at identifying businesses. We're good at the contracting phase of it. And as you heard during our earlier comments, we're very good at the integration and synergy phase of it as well. And our shareholders like what we do from M&A.
 So will it continue to be our first call on capital, if we've got the right deal? The answer is it will. So our capital priorities remain the same. The right deal is, #1, investing in the business responsibly is #2, and returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and through share repurchases remains #3. And my guess is those will be our priorities for quite a while. So again, I hope that's responsive to your question. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. 
Angel Castillo Malpica: And Ward, just to build off that last comment there, it sounds like nothing is really changing there in terms of the capital allocation priorities. But curious, as M&A perhaps or the opportunities to do things at attractive multiples as you have done in kind of the last several quarters here. Just curious as you think about the valuation, one, how is it evolving in terms of the pipeline opportunities?
 And two, I think some of your peers have talked about their ability to do greenfields in kind of a shorter period of time is 4 years. So just help us understand, I guess, maybe how that's evolving with rates, where they are with the valuations where they are, just any kind of puts and takes there in terms of opportunities around greenfields as well as M&A. 
C. Nye: Yes. Thank you for the question. Number one, what I would say is when we go through a transaction and look at what we can do from a synergy perspective on making the operations safer, on making the operations more efficient and making sure that we can bring more products to market. The ability to go through a business and synergize it from those perspectives so it works for our customers is important, and that's precisely what we've been able to do at Blue Water, and that's what we're doing right now at Albert Frei. And through that type of process that we have, we can take what might otherwise look like a relatively high multiple. And by the time we're done with it, bring it to a multiple that you look at, and I look at our shareholders look at and feel like that's a very attractive model.
 Our view is that's the way that we're going to continue growing our business. Now from a land use and planning perspective, look, we're good at that, too. We're good at identifying property. We're got going through the zoning, we're going to going through special use permitting. But frankly, you're going to see more of that adjacent to ongoing operations than you will from a greenfield perspective. And one reason I feel that way. Look, I think 4 years is a pretty heady time frame to think about a greenfield operation. I think a more realistic time frame is probably 7 to 10 years. And if we think about the difference in cash flow, getting a meaningful profit in buying a business today as opposed to greenfielding, we think that's a more constructive way to do it.
 The other thing to keep in mind is we're an awfully long way away from being anywhere near peak volumes in our business. So we're looking at reserves in the ground today that are nearly 70 years at current extraction rates. So our need to go out and put in greenfield locations is not terribly high. Our need in some instances, for example, in California and what we did in Colorado years ago in buying adjacent properties, bulking up what looks like a 30-year reserve position in California, it's something that's going to be a lot longer. We think that's a very sensible way to go through land purchase.
 And you heard me speak earlier in our CapEx number we're looking at some opportunistic land purchases. But I would expect us to do M&A, I would expect us to do within multiples that to us, and I believe to you, will look quite reasonable, and I would look for us not to do so much greenfielding but to be more focused in our heritage business and adding reserves to existing locations. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital Markets. 
Garik Shmois: I was hoping if you could speak to what you're seeing on the cost side. Obviously, you had good margin performance in aggregates in the quarter despite the weaker volumes, just wondering if you could speak to any updated cost assumptions if anything has changed since the beginning of the year? 
James Nickolas: Yes. Garik, Jim here. I think I indicated at the last quarter's call about 7% COGS per ton inflation. I think that's still accurate for the full year. I would say that inflation rate will be higher in the first half of the year and lower in the back half of the year, but a blended average of 7%. So I think it's still consistent. We did have some diesel tailwinds in Q1 that's going to fade as the year goes on. But I think on an overall basis, I think 7% is still the right number. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from Truist. 
Keith Hughes: I just want to go back to the organic unit expectation for the year. I'm a little surprised at some of your comments, given that usually this weather gets pushed, whether shortfall gets pushed forward. And with the highway money coming in, is the non-res offset that big? If you could just talk a little more about that. 
C. Nye: I think the overall private offset is what we're more focused on. I think we believe the heavy side of non-res will continue to be attractive, Keith. I think we believe that we're going to see a continued build in public throughout the year with momentum going into next year. I think if we're seeing degrees of softness, and we are, it's going to be in the like non-res and the res. And of course, single-family res is about 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily is. So I think as we're just looking at it through those lenses with longer, higher interest rates. And frankly, degrees of share that we're properly giving up and have given up with respect to our value-over-volume philosophy. I think as we're looking at those things together, that leads us to the conclusion that I've offered to you relative to the organic overall volume on aggregates. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. 
Philip Ng: Appreciating Texas Cement a little smaller now for the divestiture. While it was obviously a little wet to start the year. So just curious, how is the April Texas demand increase coming along? You guys are obviously ramping up grinding capacity from Midlothian. Have you locked up some of that business? Any risk it puts on perhaps pricing in the back half? And does the market, in your view, support potentially a midyear for Texas Cement. I like to see where you guys are situated? 
C. Nye: Well, thanks for the question. So several things. One, if we're looking at ASP, really looking at it on mix adjusted, it was up like 8.7%. So I mean number one, that's a pretty good number, taking into account a lot of things happened in April. The other thing that I will tell you is we have not given up the goes on the prospect of a price increase in September as well. So no, we continue to see North Texas being very healthy. We continue to see the pricing environment there, very good. And keep in mind, we've got a big internal customer there of our own as well. And we treat our own business just like we treat other customers in that marketplace.
 So again, we feel like that's going to be pretty attractive. The other piece of it that fits together, and I think this is what we're saying as we look at it, Equally, if we look at ASPs in ready mix, I mean, they were up 9% versus the prior year quarter. So again, the ready-mix business, despite the fact that we had significant weather headwinds in the Southwest, we actually had nice weather or nicer weather in Arizona. And if we look at the overall gross profit for ready mix for the quarter, quarter-over-quarter, it was actually nicely up. And again, I read that through for you, Phil, because I think that's a good indicator of what's happening in cement as well. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. 
Brent Thielman: Ward, what inning or quarter or however you'd like to describe do you think you're in with respect to the legacy Heidelberg assets, essentially the California business I'm thinking in particular just around the pricing optimization strategy. And could we infer sort of a similar time line for what you plan to implement in AFS and BWI? 
C. Nye: Brent, thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, I still think we're in relatively early innings in California. I mean that's still a business that if we look at the overall average selling price, it's below our corporate average. You can't say that about many things in California. So I think that's a piece of it. I think the other thing that we're focused on is continuing to grow our business in aggregates in that state. And I think as we continue to do that, that business will mature. That business will become more profitable. Our team will become more seasoned. And that business from the perspective of what does it look like from a percentage of profit look like -- it looks like a lot of the rest of Martin Marietta. So I would think we're in relatively early innings there.
 If we think about the Frei business and the Blue Water businesses, yes look, I mean, they're clearly below a Martin Marietta average. We're already talking obviously about mid-years in the Blue Water transactions. Those are also more home markets for us. I mean that's -- those are Southeastern markets and markets that we know well. I'm not sure what the rate and pace of those businesses will look like compared to California. But my guess is they will likely run in parallel, maybe modestly ahead. That would be the way I would think about it, Brent. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. 
Michael Dudas: I want to come back to your comment on data centers. Relative to some of the other heavy res, non-res markets seems a little bit more in the presentation as well, bit more cautious. Is that a reflection of just the fact of power siting issues, lumpiness in where these data centers are going to be in the areas that you participate? It's just a little -- is it just there's so much demand there? It just needs to be a kind of a sorting out of this opportunity? I just want to get a sense from your standpoint being a large vendor in the early stage of it. 
C. Nye: Yes, I would say several things about it. Number one, there was a really good piece in the Wall Street Journal about 10 days ago, talking about how prolific these data centers will be and talking to a degree about what some of the roadblocks we've had in getting them in and they're multifold. One is land. I mean what's available to is degrees of energy. And I think one reason we feel particularly good about that is the presence that we have in the central part of the United States. So as I'm sitting here today, there are 4 data centers under construction today in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. I mean that -- and those are actually really important markets for us.
 So again, as we're looking at the long-term secular e-commerce, cloud, AI trends but importantly, the where on that, I think that's where we get to advantage Martin Marietta because are we going to have more of that in the Southeast? Yes. Is land use going to be a bit more complicated here? Yes. Will they need more in Texas and the Southwest? Yes. And will land use people, water, et cetera, be a bit more complicated? Yes. But again, as we're looking in the Central United States today, where we have a very significant presence and a very attractive business, I think, in the near term, meaning '24, part of early '25. I think that's where we'll see it. And I think that's going to be our differentiator. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. 
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, can you comment on the value over volume strategy? Kind of why is that sticking with us here? And any additional color on why we're dealing with that issue? 
C. Nye: I guess one thing that I would say is, frankly, I think our products have been underpriced for a long time. And there's no heavy side building activity that takes place without our product. And we're 10% of the cost of building a road. We're 2% of the cost of building a home and some part between those 2 numbers on a non-res project. but we're also mining and putting something on the ground that takes a lot of skill to do it well and to do it safely. And from our perspective, making sure we're getting good value for the product is really important. And if you look at the quarter that just ended, if ever there was a quarter that revealed why value over volume is so important, this has been it, right? I mean you're looking at ASPs up over 12%, you're looking at volume down 12%.
 But here's what you and I know. The pricing is going to stick and the volume is going to come back. And when those 2 things happen, what you have is a margin expansion show that's really quite impressive. So if we look at the overall difficulties of doing our business, the overall difficulties of getting into our business and the degree of work that we have to go through to put a quality specification product on the ground safely. I think talking to our teams about value is an important conversation for us to have. And from a customer perspective, what we've largely seen is if they have enough time to work those numbers into their bid, it tends to work relatively well from their perspective as well.
 So look, as we've said before, I think if we're in a world that we're looking at pricing the way it was looked at in our company here 4 or 5 years ago, going forward, something has gone wrong at that point. I just -- I believe we're in a different period of time, a different economic cycle and a different way of thinking about value of our product in the ground and in the stockpile. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. 
David S. MacGregor: Ward, congratulations on all the progress on the portfolio management, very impressive. 
C. Nye: David, thank you so much. You've watched it a long time. So you've been able to see it. 
David S. MacGregor: Yes. Well, it's still going. It sounds like it still has more to go. I wanted to just ask you about the weather impact in the first quarter and how that may have complicated price realizations on your beginning of the year pricing. I know you kind of touched this in response to a previous question, but I may want to come at this at a slightly different angle. Can you just talk about the variance that you're seeing on kind of an MSA to MSA basis across your footprint? in terms of traction on this price increase?
 And also from a weather standpoint, given that maybe some of this is getting pushed out a little bit, does it leave you maybe looking at some ASP pressure temporarily in 2Q before you're able to get greater footing on those price actions in 3Q and beyond? 
C. Nye: David, thanks for the question. I would say several things. You know what, to the last part of your question first, I don't think it puts a degree of 2Q pressure on that. And again, we think we're going to see degrees of midyears even beyond what we've already built into the guide right now. What I would say relative to the weather, it was really more of a Southwest issue than anything else because there was so much rain in Texas and it was so considerably different year-over-year. We did see degrees of deferrals in some places in Texas from January 1 to April 1. And that was part of the conversation that I was having a bit earlier relative to cement in particular. So I do think the weather in that unique circumstance played a bit of a role.
 But again, keep in mind, a lot of the country was accustomed to seeing April 1 pricing. So this notion of pushing everything to January 1 was really something that we've introduced with our customer base here over the last, let's call it, 18 months to 24 months anyway. So I think if I'm looking at whether, how it affected pricing, I think that was it. I think it was relatively discrete I don't think it puts any degree of undue pressure on what we'll see here in the second quarter or for the balance of the year. And I do think it's one of the reasons, again, that we're going to be at least looking at the prospect of some September price increases in cement because it was a little bit slower coming out of the gate in January. David, does that help? 
David S. MacGregor: Yes, it does. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. 
Timna Tanners: I wanted to ask about the data center commentary with regard to the 800,000 tons. Is that normal for a data center? Or is that, that particular Google one you mentioned? And also how do we compare that with the footprint of a warehouse because I've heard some comparison there. Just wondering like size-wise, how they compare against one another. And I think there was an earlier question about maybe your caution there, but it is in your presentation is something you're more cautious on. So I just want to make sure we understand that. 
C. Nye: Yes. Good question, Timna. Look, I don't look at that and think of that as being anywhere outside of a normal fairway on what you'd expect on that type of a large commercial project in that type of space. So do I think that's pretty consistent with degrees of other large warehousing? Yes, I think it probably is because if you think about it, Timna, several things are happening. One, they're doing the normal site work that's going to take a good dealer base. At some point, they're putting in the floors that would typically be concrete. At some point, too, they're going to build the walls. And keep in mind, this isn't typically an exercise in aesthetics. In other words, it's not going to be brick. It's not going to be other things that are painted for beauty. In large measure, although I'm not saying there's not beauty in concrete walls. In large measure, these will be concrete tilt-up walls.
 And then the last piece of it, it goes back to some of the conversation I had earlier, Oftentimes, you'll see TPO roofing on these. And I referenced relative to the question on a read-through in Mag, was there anything that could pull through, I think this is an example of that. So no, 800,000 tons isn't unusual. Two, I think it's about in the middle of the fairway. Three, that what the typical build looks like at one of these.
 And as you know, for us, in many respects, it's all about location. And the point I was referencing there in particular, we're the largest underground miner in aggregates in the United States. And when we get in the central part of the United States, in particular, we're able to use our underground mine locations to actually be closer to market centers than we would be able to if we were mining in open pit locations. And what that means is this, for somebody that we're talking about is one that is literally almost above us. So from a proximity perspective, Timna, that actually works very well. 
Timna Tanners: That's helpful color. I like the beauty in concrete. 
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A portion for today's call. I would like to turn it back to Ward Nye for closing remarks. 
C. Nye: Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. In summary, we believe our commitment to world-class safety, commercial and operational excellence and sustainable business practices position us to provide compelling results for the foreseeable future.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Martin Marietta's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacqueline, you may begin.
Jacklyn Rooker: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nicholas. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward and I will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our 2023 financial highlights and operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. After which, Ward will conclude with end market trends and our 2024 outlook. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Jacklyn, thank you. Good morning and thank you so much for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report 2023 was the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. We delivered both record financial performance, eclipsing $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and also world-class safety results, achieving a world-class total injury incident rate for the third year in a row and a world-class lost-time incident rate for the seventh consecutive year. This year was also highlighted by several portfolio enhancing transactions significantly strengthening both the durability of our business and our balance sheet and which cumulatively, positions us well to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our 2023 achievements were accomplished despite a macroeconomic environment encumbered by restrictive monetary policy, a housing slowdown, and heightened geopolitical tensions. That our team was able to successfully overcome these challenges further underscores the continued success of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan, the vitality of our purposely curated geographic footprint, our team's steadfast execution of our proven value over volume commercial strategy, and the resiliency and earnings power of our aggregates-led business. Subsequent to year-end, on January 12th, we closed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, expanding our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area. More recently, on February 11, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia aggregates operations of Blue Water Industries, a closely held pure-play aggregates producer with a portfolio of 20 active operations and attractive Southeast markets, including Nashville, Knoxville, and Miami. Consistent with our SOAR plan upon closing of the Blue Water Industries acquisition, which is expected to occur later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, these two pure-play aggregates transactions will not only add approximately 1 billion tons of high-quality reserves in specific SOAR-targeted markets, but also enhance the product mix of our portfolio. Assuming these transactions have closed on January 1, 2024, we would have expected these two acquisitions to generate approximately $180 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, more than offsetting the adjusted EBITDA divested in the February 9, 2024 sale of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. As we turn the page to 2024, favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy and giving effect to the recently closed Colorado acquisition and Texas divestiture, we expect to deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. However, assuming these transactions and the recently announced Bluewater Industries' acquisition had all been completed as of January 1, 2024, we would have expected the new portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion in 2024 at the midpoint. Before discussing our full year 2023 results, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter. Aggregates pricing increased 15%, driving product line gross profit of $328.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 36.8% and gross profit per ton of $7.04, a year-over-year increase of 39.8%, both fourth quarter records. While aggregate shipments decreased 2.1%, these financial results clearly demonstrate the success of our sales team's commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. The primary and disproportionate organic earnings growth driver of our business. Turning now to our full year 2023 results. As previously noted, we established new financial records in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated total revenues of $6.8 billion, a 10% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $2 billion, a 42.1% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $19.32, a 41% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, a 33% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.93, a 46.4% increase. Moreover, we successfully implemented midyear price increases across the majority of our markets as we endeavor to pass through persistently high cost inflation. Shifting now to our full year 2023 operating performance beginning with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 4.3%, the combined result of our value over volume strategy and softer demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing increased to 18.9% or 17.2% on a mix-adjusted basis as pricing fundamentals remain attractive. Texas Cement shipments decreased 3.4% to 4 million tonnes. Pricing increased 22% or 21.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 12.1%, but that reduction was largely driven by the April 2022 divestiture of the company's Colorado and Central Texas concrete businesses. Pricing increased a robust 20.4%. Asphalt shipments increased 3.5% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing end market trends and our 2024 outlook, Jim will now discuss our full year financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we completed the sale of our South Texas Cement plant and related concrete operations last week on February 9th. While these businesses were classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of December 31st, revenues and profits from these operations through the divestiture date are included in the earnings from continuing operations. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are included in both 2023 as reported earnings from continuing operations and in our 2024 earnings guidance through the February 9th close date. The revenues and profits from the Colorado assets acquired on January 12th, 2024, also are included in our forward earnings guidance. Lastly, the Bluewater Industries transaction has not yet closed and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Accordingly, the contributions from the pending acquisitions are not included in our 2024 earnings guidance. That said, we will provide updated earnings guidance after closing Bluewater transaction, which is expected to occur later this year. The Building Materials business posted full year 2023 revenues of $6.5 billion, an increase of 10.3% and gross profit of $1.9 billion, a notable 43.7% increase year-over-year, both new records. The aggregates business achieved all-time record revenues in 2023, growing 10.9% to $4.3 billion. Gross profit increased 40.1% to $1.4 billion, and gross margin increased 660 basis points to 32%. Again, both all-time records. Solid pricing growth more than offset lower shipments, further demonstrating how the disciplined execution of our value over volume, commercial strategy yields, higher profits and higher margins even without the benefit of growing volumes. Our Texas Cement business extended its track record of outstanding performance and once again delivered record top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 17% to $725.5 million and gross profit increased 64.6% to $333.6 million, driven primarily by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and energy cost tailwinds. As a reminder, the new finish mill at our Midlothian, Texas plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024, adding approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high margin annual production capacity. Moving to our targeted downstream businesses. Our concrete revenues increased 5.9% to $1 billion and gross profit increased 44.2% to $102 million, driven primarily by pricing gains and mega project contributions, which more than offset higher upstream, raw material, and delivery costs. Asphalt and paving revenues increased 12.6% to $887.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.7% to $109 million. The result of strong demand and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties full year revenues increased 3.8% to $315.4 million, while gross profit increased 6.9% to $97.1 million. Strong pricing and energy cost tailwinds more than offset weaker demand in certain magnesia end markets, including TPO roofing and cobalt mining. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. In 2023, we invested $650 million of capital into our business and returned $324 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times as of December 31st, assuming the Albert Frei & Sons and Bluewater Industries' acquisitions and South Texas Cement and related concrete operations divestiture were effective as of January 1st, 2024, after giving effect to the impacts of these transactions, our net debt to EBITDA ratio would have been 1.85 times, just below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which would provide ample dry powder to take advantage of additional value-enhancing acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward to discuss end market trends.
Ward Nye: Jim, thanks so much. We're enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate healthy demand in public and heavy non-residential construction will largely offset softness in the residential sector and expected moderation in light non-residential construction. However, anticipated decreases in mortgage rates should provide tailwinds in residential demand and an uptick in single-family home construction as evidenced by recent [Indiscernible] data. As you've heard us say for years in this business, where you are matters and Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these long-term secular trends. Infrastructure activity is expected to remain resilient as funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, along with record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, as well as voter-approved state and local transportation-related ballot initiatives coalesce to per years of steady investment and demand. The value of state and local government highway, bridge, and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, grew 8% to $113 billion in 2023. According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, Texas, Colorado, California, Georgia, and Florida, key Martin Marietta states are among some of the largest growing markets based on contract awards. Importantly, our investment in our nation's infrastructure continues to maintain broad bipartisan support. During the November 2023 election, voters approved 88% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $7 billion of additional infrastructure funding. We expect this enhanced level of federal, state, and local infrastructure investment will yield steady, multiyear demand in this important aggregates-intensive often countercyclical end market. Moving to non-residential and starting with heavy industrial, strong demand for large manufacturing and heavy side energy projects is expected to counterbalance ongoing moderation in warehouse and data center construction from its COVID peak. Construction spending from manufacturing in the United States continues to trend positively with the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $214 billion, a 61% increase from the December 2022 value of $133 billion. Manufacturing projects continue to be supported by health demand from the ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, including semiconductors and electric vehicle battery manufacturing. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Toyota announced an $8 billion expansion to their battery manufacturing campus in North Carolina, bringing their total investment to approximately $14 billion. This incremental investment solidifies North Carolina is Toyota's central hub for lithium-ion battery production in North America with this campus having over 7 million square feet. Importantly, our quarries are well-positioned to supply the aggregates needs for this type of multiyear project. Shifting to light non-residential, while demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates, and tighter commercial lending additions, we expect 2024 demand in this segment to moderate as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Given the structural housing deficit and favorable population trends in key Martin Marietta markets, we fully expect the affordability-driven single-family residential slowdown will recover as interest rates declined further and monthly mortgage payments become relatively more affordable. Although there's still near-term uncertainty, we're encouraged by recent trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregate demand, which were 1 million units in December, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. As previously mentioned, we anticipate flat aggregate shipments as infrastructure and large-scale non-residential projects should largely offset softness in the residential and light non-residential sectors. With steady product demand, supporting favorable commercial dynamics and the disciplined execution of our value over volume strategy, we expect double-digit aggregates pricing growth to overcome inflationary pressures and lead to expanded gross margins and unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses and contributions from our recently acquired Colorado assets, we are confident in our expectations for consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting performance in 2023. We demonstrated our ability to successfully navigate another challenging macroeconomic environment and deliver superior returns for shareholders. As we begin the new year, our teams remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial, and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build the safest, best-performing, and most durable aggregates-led public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in driving responsible and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Please ask your question.
Trey Grooms: Yes, good morning Ward and Jim. You guys have been quite busy and first wanted to congratulate you and the team on the recent acquisition announcement, they look like great assets and a great fit for you guys.
Ward Nye: Thank you very much. A busy weekend, I'll tell you that.
Trey Grooms: Yes, I bet it was. On that note, Jim, and you touched on it, but could you -- could you help us with a bit more detail on how to bridge the guide for the full year? Maybe help us understand and quantify what is included, what is not included as we look at the guide for 2024?
Jim Nickolas: Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So, we've closed now on two transactions, the acquisition of Al Frei, that is in -- and that -- you can think about that maybe between $40 million and $45 million of EBITDA coming from that business. And then we've also closed the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and ready-mix business. And you can think about that as around $170 million of EBITDA that was divested. So, those are coming out of what you would have seen from the 2023 view. The Bluewater acquisition, call it, $135 or so million of EBITDA that is not -- that would be a full year run rate view that is not included in our guide. We will, of course, include that -- when that closes, we'll update our guidance for that additional EBITDA at that point. But hopefully, that provides the necessary ins and outs for you to make that work.
Trey Grooms: Yes, that's helpful. Got it. And one more, if I could. I'm located not too far from some of your locations. And it's no secret, January weather was tough, particularly here in the South where we aren't used to snow and ice or sub-freezing temps for long periods of time. Can you help us on maybe how to think about that in 1Q? And anything else to note that maybe we should be aware of as we think about this first quarter?
Ward Nye: Trey, thanks a lot. I mean that's a really good question because as you recall, last year in Q1 weather was actually disproportionately good. And I think when people saw in Q1 numbers, they thought, wow, that's really something. And you know what I've long said, the first quarter can largely be made or broken by the last two weeks in March. But if you do have really challenging weather in January and February, it can put you back a little bit. So, to that end, you should expect a different cadence. I'm going to turn to Jim and ask him to give you some more detail on what that cadence is likely to look like this year. So, Jim back to you for a moment on that place.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So, Q1 2023, as Ward mentioned, was unseasonably good. That year, Q1 represented 15% of our gross profit. I'm speaking on a consolidated basis, so it's not a product-by-product. But on a consolidated basis, 15% of gross profits were earned in Q1. Again, it's a lower -- EBIT lower profit quarter. So, small changes can have big percentage impacts. And then pointing out, as you did the weather this year is worse in Q1. I'm now going to guess around 11.5% of our gross profits that occurred in Q1 of this year. So, that's about a 350 basis point drop. I would say with Q2, Q3, and Q4 would each be about a little bit more than 1 percentage points increasing versus what they were last year. Again, that's percentages of total yearly profits. Does that help?
Trey Grooms: Yes, sir. I got it. That's super helpful. Thank you and good luck.
Ward Nye: Thanks so much. Just one bit more color on that. So, obviously, January was a really challenging month for customers and everyone else as you would imagine. February, as we've seen good weather come through, the business has done what we would have thought. So, I think that's important to note as a footnote to what Jim just took you through. But Trey, thanks for the question.
Trey Grooms: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Please ask your question.
Stanley Elliott: Good morning Ward, Jim. Congratulations on another successful year. Ward, maybe a good time to get an update on how you guys are thinking about SOAR 2025. I mean you effectively doubled the market cap since that came out in 2020, 2021. Any comments on, I guess, the execution thus far, maybe how are you thinking about recent future and future portfolio moves and maybe tie that back into your commercial efforts?
Ward Nye: Stanley, thanks for the question. You're right. I mean, we've been really disciplined, very thoughtful in each of our SOAR five-year increments. So, if you go back in time and remember the first one came out in 2010, and that was through 2015. Then in 2015, we did SOAR 2020 than most recently, again, very cleverly SOAR 2025. And we've been able in each of those to effectively double our market cap and we're almost there now. And obviously, we still had some track ahead of us in SOAR 2025. I would say a couple of things. One, the commercial execution that you've seen us focused on is something that we will continue to be focused on. I think you see it in what we've given relative to our guide this year. Again, we're looking at ASP increases at 11% at the midpoint. And again, I think it's important to say, Stanley, that does not contemplate mid-years. That's the same type of conversation we had in 2023 as well. And you'll recall that we came back and actually had mid-years in more than half of our markets. So, again, we'll come back and revisit that at half year and see where that is. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is you've seen what I think is a lot of very productive, very appropriate M&A. I think it's totally consistent with what we've sent to the market. We are an aggregates-led business. And part of what I moved by, if we look at simply what's occurred so far this year, two large transactions with assets coming into the organization, obviously, Bluewater still has some time to go through the Hart-Scott process. But we'll close on that transaction between Bluewater and what we've done without Frei & Sons, those are two pure-play aggregates businesses. And what I'm particularly moved by as well, if we look at our pipeline, that's what our pipeline looks like, too. I do believe our company is positioned from a quality growth perspective and a very compelling and it's an overused term, but I almost think unique position as well. So, will commercial discipline, be a piece of it? You bet. Will operational excellence be a piece of it? And we think it continue to be, particularly as we bring these businesses into our hold. But again, our ability to do shareholder value increasing transactions, we think here in the near-term, medium term and long-term is a fundamental differentiator for our business. And if we think about what value creation looks like for Martin Marietta and its shareholders, we think those are the key drivers. But Stanley, I hope that's helpful in response to your question.
Stanley Elliott: Sure does. Thanks so much and best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please ask your question.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Anthony Pettinari: The gross profit per ton guidance of $840 million, I think, implies cost per ton up maybe mid-single-digit year-over-year. if I got that right. And I'm just wondering if you could bridge that between maybe some of your different cost inputs and any kind of assumptions around cost categories and maybe energy for the balance of the year?
Ward Nye: So, happy to take, but I'll ask Jim to go through and give you a bucket-by-bucket view. But overall, you're entirely right. If we're just looking at general inflation, it's going to be in the mid to high single-digits range. That can obviously move around a little bit, but there are some components of our business that are seeing higher pieces of inflation. I think it's important to say that labor is actually not one of those. Those numbers continue to be in a very comfortable place, both for our workforce and for our company, but let Jim take you through some of the puts and takes on some of the other inputs.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, you're right. It's about 7% inflation on the COGS -- on the aggregates business, COGS per ton. So, here are the items that are above 7% or north of 7%. Oil lubricants, we're expecting to be up quite a bit explosive, still remain high. The parts and equipment for the plants, also about the ZIP code. So, those are the areas that are pushing it above 7%, areas that are pushing it below 7 are, as Ward mentioned, labor, which is our biggest cost component and also diesel and electricity, nat gas. Those are not expected to be headwinds in 2024. So, those are the large buckets, I would say, that are deviating from the 7%, some are more than 7%, others are well below the 7%. But on a blended basis, that's where we're ending up.
Anthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And the assumption for diesel is just current prices or--
Jim Nickolas: There's a smidge of a headwind in for diesel, not much off of current spot prices.
Ward Nye: So, we hope we've been a bit punitive to ourselves. We'll see how that plays out, Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: No, that’s very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Ward Nye: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.
Angel Castillo: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just was curious on the recent acquisitions. I was wondering if you could help us quantify a little bit more or give us a little bit more color as to kind of upside opportunity on the pricing side as you look at those assets in those regions in terms of bringing those more to the value over volume strategy?
Ward Nye: Well, look, if we look at the overall businesses and looking at the prior business in Colorado, they were doing somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million tons of stone per annum. Denver is a very attractive marketplace. We'll have to see how that plays out. But you can go back over time and get a good sense of commercially at least how we've approached those markets. As you can imagine, the barriers to some degree of entry and hard rock can be quite high in a number of markets. So, we feel very good about our team in Colorado. They're very cost conscious. They're very commercially focused. And we think the marketplace in Denver will continue to be very attractive for an extended period of time. Keep in mind, if we go back -- let's call it, 13 years. We had no significant business at all in Colorado. We look up and down the Front Range today. We're the clear leader in aggregates up down the I-25 corridor. Remember, that's where 80%-plus the population in Colorado lives. And again, the biggest piece of it being in Denver. And now between the Walstrom quarry, which we picked up in our Spec AGG quarry, a very attractive position in that marketplace. If we go and look at Bluewater, obviously, that transaction has not closed. We're going through the Hart-Scott process soon and we're hoping to have that done half year-ish heavy on the ish, by the way. It could clearly push into the second half of the year. If we look at the overall tonnage, that's going to be around 13 million tons of stone. But importantly, if you look at the markets in which it gives us a nice footprint, these are markets that we've long talked about wanting to have a natural position. And so suddenly, we find ourselves in Nashville. Suddenly, we find ourselves in Knoxville. Now we find ourselves in a much more significant way in South Florida and around Miami. So, if you go back and take a look at the slide presentation that we gave to the analysts and investors in February of 2021, we talked about a series of markets that we wanted to enter when we talk about Northern California, Southern California, Arizona, in and around Austin, Texas. We talked about Middle Tennessee, we talked about South Florida, and we talked about in Northern Virginia. We are literally in a place now that we're putting checks in most of those boxes. So, again, if you take a look at the overall pricing at these facilities relative to our corporate average, it's modestly below our corporate average. So, again, I'm hoping I'm giving you something directionally that you can work with. But that gives you a sense of the market, it gives you a sense of the overall volume. I do think we will operationally bring increased efficiencies to these markets, and we're thrilled to, number one, have already brought the Frei team into the Martin Marietta fold, and we look forward to bringing the Bluewater team into our organization as well. So, hopefully answer that response to your question.
Angel Castillo: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet,
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone.
Ward Nye: Good morning Jerry.
Ward Nye: I'm wondering if we just take a step back, historically, in a flat end demand environment, the industry has realized 4 points of price or less. And obviously, we're putting up much better performance here in the price/cost spread widening. As you think about what the industry learned over the course of the hyperinflation period, I guess, do you think the fear of inflation stays with the industry beyond this year? Or could we return to slower pricing cadence in 2025 towards that historical rate? I know it's super early, but I feel like the industry got burned with inflation surprising on the upside. I'm wondering -- does that change the mindset for obviously, you folks and others in your markets?
Ward Nye: Well, Jerry, the only thing I can speak to is Martin Marietta, of course. And I would say several things. One, obviously, inflation has moved significantly over the last couple of years. And we took the actions that were smart and prudent to protect our company as that went up. Secondly, at least here in our company, we recognize that having these long-lived reserves is significant. We're sitting here today at current extraction rates with reserves in excess of 70 years. Something that I think we talk about inside our company is these reserves are worth more tomorrow than they are today. In some geographies, it's very difficult to replicate or replace the reserves. And I think as we think long term, and that's how we tend to think about this business. If we go back to one of the questions that was earlier, they were asking about SOAR and the fact that we look at our business in five-year increments. But the simple fact is, Jerry, we think about our business in terms of decades, not years, not five years, but really decades. And as we look at it through that lens, we recognize that we have the product that is absolutely essential in every form of heavy side development. You don't need asphalt in every piece of it. You don't need concrete in every piece of -- but you need the aggregates in absolutely every piece of it. So, from our perspective, as we looked at what aggregate sells for on a per ton basis and then we consider, one, its vitality to a product or to a project and its overall cost relative to the project, we think we're actually adding more to an individual project than we're costing a project. That's how we think about what we're doing. So, if we go back to the notion of will commercial excellence continue to be a driver for our organization, and I think make our pricing look fundamentally different going forward than it did, say, a decade ago Yes, I think it probably will. Do I think operationally, we will continue to bring great value to the organization by making our businesses better faster, safer, more efficient, et cetera. Yes, I think we will. But I also think that what you should expect from us, and this ties to a degree to it as well, Jerry we will continue to be a very responsible, very visionary acquirer of attractive businesses in attractive geographies. And I think if you take those building blocks that I've taken you through, it gives you a good sense of how to think about the business overall from a commercial perspective.
Jerry Revich: Really appreciate the color. And then you folks have been super busy over Super Bowl weekend. And I'm wondering if you look at the M&A pipeline today now that we're wrapping up the last deal, hopefully, that announced soon. The M&A pipeline from here, word, what's the range of outcomes in terms of how much more capital we can deploy over the balance of 2024, you predicted 2024 was going to be a really active M&A year and I'm just wondering how much is left or there to do based on what's in the pipeline?
Ward Nye: Jerry, that's a great question. So, here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. Let's assume that Frei's closed, which it is, and let's assume the Bluewater was closed. We'd be leveraged at about 1.85 times. So, keep in mind, through a cycle, we like to be leveraged 2 times to 2.5 times. So, we're still, despite that degree of acquisitive activity, we're still below where we would typically like to be. So, my point is this, when we've seen attractive transactions before, we haven't done it a lot, but we've gone over 3 times. We've delevered actually very quickly and easily when we've done that. I continue to believe that there will be more transactional activity this year. I would be disappointed if there's not. You're right on our Q3 call back in November, I said at that time, I thought 2024 would be a pretty busy year. Obviously, we're about a month and a half into it. It's been a really busy year already. But Jerry, the fact is that I think there's going to be more, I'd be disappointed if there wasn't, and you should expect it to be more pure stone type transactions, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Super. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Philip Ng: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. If I take your guidance, Jim, I think you're calling for flattish volumes for the full year. Not too dissimilar to what you told us back on the 3Q call, but I believe your guide now includes AFS, so that would imply maybe volumes are a little softer, but everything that you mentioned, Ward, sounded pretty constructive. So, I just want to make sure we're -- one, we're not overthinking about this. And when you look out to the back half, I mean, you kind of talked about rates coming down, that could be a good guide for housing. Could volumes kind of inflect in the back half and go into 2025? Is there a good way to think about the trajectory for us?
Ward Nye: Phil, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. Number one, you're right. I mean, if we're looking at bringing in Frei, and let's call it, 3.5 million tons, one thing that happened in our sale of the Hunter cement plant is we're actually doing some stone production there as well that was going into the cement production. So, in fairness, that was probably about 2 million tonnes. So, really, if you start taking a look at what went the other way in the Hunter transaction, what's going this other way near-term and Frei, keep in mind that you've got a fairly seasonally impacted business in Colorado as well. Again, I think it leads you back to that relatively flattish. So, I wouldn't strain too hard on what those numbers look like because there's just enough movement on the surface of it that it could put you in a much more comfortable place you [indiscernible] booking pure flat. To your point, though, I do believe if we see interest rate reductions and we see a steady, albeit somewhat slow recovery in housing and then what's likely to be degrees of light non-res that comes behind that in the second half of the year. I'm not sure how much is going to push volumes up in half two. I think it certainly could push volumes up in half two. I think what it's really doing is it's setting up 2025 to be even a more productive year. Obviously, on the infrastructure side, we think it's going to be pretty constructive all by itself. I mean if you think about the fact that we're looking at what's happened on highway contract awards and you're looking at basic and LTM from December 2019 through 2023, that's got almost an 11% CAGR involved in it. And then we're looking at our top 10 states and DoT budgets themselves that are up on average, 10%. And here's some percentages to keep in mind. Texas, which had a really heady budget is up 24%. Florida, which has been at record levels, it's up 9%. North Carolina, our home court is up 11%. Minnesota, when we bought the business there from Tiller several years ago, we said that was a really attractive DoT, it's up about 38%. So, again, as we're looking at public, we think that that's going to be pretty compelling. Even as we sit and move to non-res, if we're looking at manufacturing, the reshoring that we mentioned in our opening comments, is pretty significant. We continue to see more activity in that space. I also called out what we're seeing consistently in energy. We got a new battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana. There's some new one coming in the Bowling Green, Kentucky. But what I've been a bit surprised by and I think this may be more geographic intensive as well or sensitive is even in the areas that have had degrees of slowing warehouses and data centers. I mean we've got four data centers under construction right now in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. And there's a new one that looks like it's coming online in Covington, Georgia. So, again, if we look across our geographic footprint and recognize that we've been very selective in the where. Do I think there's a prospect that you could see some upside in the second half of the year on volumes? Yes, I do. I think that cadence that Jim spoke to earlier, it's important to keep in mind because clearly, we're not going to have Q1 that last year. But again, I think Q2, Q3, and Q4 could be attractive, recognizing, hey, pretty heady Q4. We just had this year, too. So, again, Phil, I hope that's helpful and constructive on the volumes and what the end users look like.
Philip Ng: Appreciate the great color Ward.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please ask your question.
Ward Nye: Tyler, you with us?
Tyler Brown: Yes, you there? Sorry.
Ward Nye: Yes sir, we hear you. Hi Tyler.
Tyler Brown: Yes, good deal. Hey Jim, I'm curious about the CapEx guide. So, it was a little bit higher than maybe we had expected, just considering the South Texas sale. Just curious what all is in that CapEx number. Was there a sizable -- was any spend in there, maybe outsized land acquisition. It just seems like 9.5% CapEx to sales feels a bit higher than normal, just particularly considering flattish volume.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, good question. Our range is between 8% to 10%, typically, 9% is the most common at the midpoint. But we do have a couple of large projects in there. And you're right, the finished mill seven is among those that's one of the larger spends in 2024 as we wrap up that project. Another one is our Beckman plant in San Antonio is getting a significant upgrade there as well. So, the largest items that are helping to push that up to a little bit more than normal, but still well within the range of what I think is typical for us.
Ward Nye: Hey Tyler, let me add this too because Jim nailed it. He's exactly right. The other thing that we're seeing, though, on occasion, and we've seen it more in the last few months is real estate purchases tends to be highly opportunistic. And when the right real estate shows up, you don't always know when it's going to parachute in and we have to have the ability to be pretty agile around that. So, we're looking at some real estate purchases as well that that we think will be important in the near, medium and again, long-term for Martin Marietta, but broadly very much in that range that Jim spoke to, but those are some of the moving parts, both above the water and under the water.
Tyler Brown: Yes. No, that is very helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Please ask your question.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thanks for taking my question today. A lot of focus on all the great M&A and divestiture activity since November, certainly a busy holiday season through Super Bowl. But one of the changes also too is just in the cadence and the type of flavor of capital expenditure, CapEx as you divest some cements and take on more aggregate-focused assets. Could you walk through what this does for free cash cadence and also how we should think about capital expenditure given the change in mix? And then thoughts on capital allocation going forward, given recent activity? Thank you.
Ward Nye: So, I'm going to start with capital allocation, and then come back to Jim, and he can just talk you through more degrees of CapEx and how things can move around. If you think about the capital allocation, Katherine, one of the more elegant things about our company is that stays pretty consistent. Our view is our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. And again, I think our teams are good at that. I think they're good at identifying the deals. So, I think they're good at going through the contracting process. I think they're good at the integration process. I think they're good at the synergy realization process. So, the right transactions will be number one on capital allocation, number two, and Jim will take you through more specifics, we'll be reinvesting in the business. As you know, if you're in the business of crushing stone, you're in the business of destroying iron. So, the fact is we will stay probably in those ranges that Jim spoke about a few minutes ago, but he going to more detail. And then lastly, is returning of cash to shareholders through two things; a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and we say both of those words very intentionally and share buybacks at the right time. So, the capital allocation priorities simply do not change. Now, more to your question on how does this portfolio evolution that we've seen change the way that we look at CapEx for that over to Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So, I would expect it to go either be very constant with historical levels or maybe a little bit higher as we as we look to replant many of our aggregate plants to keep them efficient and highly automated. So, as far as cadence for the year, I would expect it to be similar to last year and the year before Q1 and Q4 a little bit heavier on the CapEx, Q2 and Q3 a little bit lighter. But of course, the things that can throw that out of whack -- on occasion would be the occasional opportunistic generation of land purchase. That would be something that could, of course, grow those percentages and historical patterns out of kilter. But hopefully, that answers the question, Kathy.
Ward Nye: And Kathryn, let me add one more note to that as well because keep in mind, when we're doing replants or otherwise, we're doing those because the income rates of return on those projects is so compelling. We almost would feel silly if we didn't do them. At the same time, part of what's still compelling about an aggregates business is we have the capacity if we need to, and we did it in COVID, and we've done it before, to pull back on that CapEx lever. If we ever need to, we don't see a need to do that. We think we can do it very constructively. We think we can do it in a very value-additive way. But again, I think as you just step back from our industry compared to others, and you look at the degrees of agility that we can bring to something like CapEx in a heavy industry is decidedly different and we think it's advantaged Martin Marietta. So, again, we hope that's responsive to your question. Jim's got one more point.
Jim Nickolas: One more point kind of an overall cash perspective, Kathryn. So, our operating cash flow grew tremendously this year. I'm comparing year-over-year now. Our CapEx did grow, but our cash conversion ratio improved in 2023 over 2022 meaningfully. So, we're very mindful of our cash flow. We think it's good and getting better even with slightly higher CapEx in 2024. We think that trend will continue.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay, great. And very helpful. And just one quick clarification on guidance on interest expense, that you released today, seeing a little light, but just wanted to hopefully can give a little bit of clarification on your interest expense guidance? Thank you.
Jim Nickolas: Sure. Yes. It's actually, it's net interest expense. So, it's gross interest expense of, call it, $160 million interest income of, call it, $100 million. So, net interest expense of about $60 million at the midpoint.
Kathryn Thompson: Great. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Please ask your question.
Timna Tanners: Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the benefits you're seeing from IIJA and any color you can provide on the cadence that you're seeing there and your visibility? We all follow the [Indiscernible] awards data, and it's been quite strong, but kind of leveled off over the last several months. So, just wondering if you can provide some more color on what you're seeing there.
Ward Nye: Timna thank you for the question. Number one, we are starting to see that weekend to pull through. And what I would say, obviously, when you're looking at what you and I know, is a $1.2 trillion bipartisan law, that's the big amount of money. That's $110 billion to roads. It's $66 billion for railroad maintenance. It's $42 billion for port and airport infrastructure. But what's important is to start drilling down and seeing what's going on in many respects on a state-by-state or at times MSA-by-MSA basis. So, if we look at where NC DoT is, for example, their budgets up 11%. They're obviously going to see nice federal money flowing through as well. What we're basically seeing is they're increasing infrastructure funding here by $7 billion over the next decade. So, again, that starts to give you a good sense of how that money is flowing through. Texas, they're looking for FY 2024 to be another record year of lettings. That's going to be at about almost $14 billion by the way, that's up about 15% year-over-year. Their unified transportation plan for FY 2024 is expected to exceed $100 billion. Again, that's an 8% increase. So, again, the federal funds that are flowing through are a big part of that. I'm particularly moved by what we've seen happen in Florida because again, the recent Florida 2024 budget increased to $17 billion. Again, that's an all-time high, over what had been an all-time high last year. But again, as we think about what Florida is able to do because of what they're seeing from IIJA you've got the move in Florida Forward Initiative that was announced in late Q3, that's going to bring $4 billion from general revenue surplus into transportation in that state. And even as we look at what's going on in California, their recently passed FY 2024 budget includes $20.5 billion for CALTRANS and that's still a 5% year-over-year increase from FY 2023. So, if we're looking at where the states are, what they're doing with their budgets, how they're taking these funds that are also coming from the Federal government? It's a pretty compelling story, as we sit back and look at it. Jim's got a few things he wants to add as well Timna.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Our volumes were down 2% for the quarter, but I'll point out our infrastructure volumes were actually up 6%. So, we think those are -- we're seeing it's coming through those infrastructure volumes.
Timna Tanners: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And just one follow-up on all the M&A discussion. You've highlighted an appetite for bolt-ons -- but obviously, you also highlighted that you have spare bandwidth or capacity, if you will, in your debt leverage. So, I'm just wondering for the right deal, are you willing to kind of tap the capital markets? Or is it still just kind of a priority for bolt-ons as you look ahead? Thanks.
Ward Nye: For the right transaction, we would certainly do that, Timna. And again, we've demonstrated the capacity if we've done the right transactions to bring down leverage very, very quickly in the organization. So, we'll just have to look at them on a transaction-by-transaction basis. But the short answer is a lot of these, if they came along, you're only going to see them once. And it again can be very opportunistic and sitting at 1.85 times levered today, even having done all that we will have done this year taking into account Frei and Bluewater. We've got a lot of dry powder right now.
Timna Tanners: Got it. Okay. Thanks again.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Please ask your question.
Michael Dudas: Morning Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Michael Dudas: So, following on the acquisition opportunities, just two thoughts. One, as you're going through your plan to SOAR 2025 and maybe beyond, is there a percentage or a mix of aggregates that you're targeting for the contribution for the whole company? And given that you've divested South Texas in a very efficient and cooperative manner with the purchaser, are there opportunities on the sell-side that, again, as you move to that mix target or where you want to be that could emerge over the next six to 12 months?
Ward Nye: Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, number one, if we look at where we're going to be after the transactions that we've done, our 2024 pro forma gross profit mix would be at 77% aggregates. I mean, should you expect that number to continue to grow? The answer is yes, you should. But I would say this, too and I think this is so important to state. The cement operation that we have in Midland Texas is a fantastic cement business. It's a long way from the Gulf of Mexico, we have our Southwest headquarters in Dallas. We're the largest aggregates producer in Dallas. We're the largest cement producer in Dallas. That business has just from my perspective, eye watering margins, we like the businesses that we have very much. And if we've got the ability, desire, and capacity to go and grow our aggregates business, which we do, and take that number that I just gave you 77% push that to 80% and then beyond that, frankly, you should expect us to do that. If we go back through the way that we've long described ourselves, we've said we're aggregates-led, with strategic cement, with targeted downstream. I mean those are, again, very well-conceived, well-thought out adjectives before each one of those businesses. And what you're seeing us to this year is totally consistent with an aggregates-led business and building a business that can outperform through cycles and we think that's so vital to what we're doing. And that's part of what's so important about also this value over volume philosophy that we're bringing to our business. So, yes, you should expect to see that aggregates number continue to go up. And again, that's very consistent with the pipeline that we're looking at today.
Michael Dudas: Thank you, Ward.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Keith Hughes from Truist. Please ask your question.
Ward Nye: Keith are you there?
Keith Hughes: Can you hear me now?
Ward Nye: Now, we hear you Keith. Yes sir.
Keith Hughes: Okay, sorry about that. So, a question on cement and the remaining cement business for 2024, what kind of price volume expectations do you have in the guide?
Jim Nickolas: I'll give you some of that, Keith. It's getting increasingly challenging for us to give too much granularity around that cement business. because that's the only cement business that we have. So, I'm torn between -- I want to make sure I'm transparent giving you everything that you need. I also don't want to put ourselves at a remarkable competitive disadvantage. So, I'll give you an overall sense -- obviously--
Keith Hughes: Give me what you can.
Jim Nickolas: I'll give you what I can with that -- so look, we obviously kept the larger of the two cement businesses. From a volume perspective, it's going to be modestly over two million tons. From a pricing perspective, we're looking at an increase in North Texas of around $15 per ton. That increase -- if I were you, I'd be modeling that more in an April timeframe as opposed to a January timeframe. Obviously, you saw very attractive margins in that business last year. And what I would suggest to you is our aim would be on a full year basis to maintain the types of margins in that business that you saw in the overall cement business last year in Texas. So, Keith, I hope that gives you broadly what you need.
Keith Hughes: That’s fine. Thank you.
Jim Nickolas: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Please ask your question.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on aggregates pricing. The outlook is in line with how you framed it coming out of the 3Q call, but and we appreciate your value over volume strategy, but there was a competitor last week that spoke to both trying to take share this year and pricing maybe a little bit more closely to inflation or the rate of deflation that they were seeing. I'm wondering if maybe you're seeing a change in the conversations at all with aggregates pricing going into this year? Are those becoming maybe a little bit more difficult? Maybe I'm over thinking here, but I just thought I'd ask the question on how those discussions have been going?
Ward Nye: No, Garik, it's a fair question. The conversations have actually been pretty constructive with our customers. And keep in mind, several things happen. Number one, location is going to matter a lot. Number two, relationship is going to matter a lot. Number three, I think the swing factor in some places may be what degrees of midyears declined. Again, the only place right now that we've already got stated midyears are in California, where we told people basically we're coming out of the gate in 2024 were $2 a ton up, and then we're going to do another $2 a ton at midyear. Keep in mind, too, that most of our customers are not the owner. They tend to be a general first-year tier sub, second tier sub, third tier sub, et cetera. and they tend to be cost-plus themselves. And if we're looking at being 10% of the cost of a road, 2% of the cost of a home, and somewhere between those two numbers on a non-res project. The price of the stone usually isn't why a project goes or why a contractor gets the job. But at the same time, we're placing that stone once it goes out of our gate can be pretty challenging. So, look, do I think -- do I think we will see years and years of price performance like we saw in 2023? No, I don't think that's going to be the norm. Do I think we're trending more towards -- but I think the norm will be from Martin Marietta this year? Yes, I think we probably are. And to me, that feels like an appropriate place for us to be given the economy, given the difficulties that you can have in replacing some of these reserves in some of these key markets. Remember, we have some urban quarries and locations that trying to find opportunities to come back behind quarries if they're depleted would be hugely challenging. And building new cars will put you further away from the city centers and take degrees of efficiency away. So, again, I hope that gives you, number one, a philosophy on how we approach it. Number two, what our dialogue looks like with our customers and number three, how I think it's going to play out, at least from Martin Marietta over a period of years.
Garik Shmois: No, that's helpful. Just wanted to follow-up just quickly just on cement margins, recognizing the increasing importance size in that segment. With the finishing coming on later this year, is there any choppiness or inefficiencies that we should be aware of?
Jim Nickolas: No, I don't think so. To the extent -- I mean we're going to be very disciplined about bringing that online. It won't be disruptive to price. We think we'll be able to bring it online gradually in terms of operational approach as well as marketplace impact. It will be very disciplined, and we think it won't be very disruptive at all. So, we're not looking for any kind of noticeable effect from external view on this point. And margins should be enhanced when those come online. So we think it's really going to fit the market is sold out by and large, and we think it will fit nicely with the growing demand there.
Garik Shmois: Understood. Thanks again and congrats on the quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks so much Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please ask your question.
Joe Nolan: Hey, good morning. This is Joe Nolan on for David.
Ward Nye: Hi Joe.
Joe Nolan: Hi. I just had one quick question on the aggregates volumes guidance, you provided up or down 2%. Just with that, what would be the primary drivers that you're monitoring to drive the high end or low end? And just within that, can you talk about how the value over volume strategy might play into that?
Ward Nye: Yes, happy to. I mean here's a good way to think of it, and this is not a bad laboratory to give it some thoughts. So, if we look in Q2, volume is down 2%. So, last year, we were at 47.7%. The year just ended 46.6%. If we're really looking at that and saying, what were your swing markets or what are you swing factors? Value over volume was probably modestly over 1 million tons of that. So, again, if we think -- what we actually had a better return for shareholders. We kept those reserves in the ground or we kept them in stockpiles. We'll sell them another day, we'll sell them for higher. And that was your primary driver, there was some degrees as well chronicle of market softening in degrees of residential and non-res, but the biggest piece of that was value over volume. So, if we're looking at what swing factors can be, as Jim pointed out, in the quarter, we saw infrastructure volumes up 6%, that wasn't a surprise, but really it was a nice affirmation of what's happening. So, if we continue to see public grow sensibly, if we see res start to do, but we're not predicting it, but you can certainly see that res could have a nice recovery beginning in half two. We think that's important. And again, as we're looking at these mega projects, if we're looking at non-res projects of size and of scale. Depending on how some of those play out, it doesn't take a lot of those. I mean it could take one or two of those to really change the trajectory of degrees of volume. And obviously, we're still having significant conversations on a number of large non-res projects in the Gulf of Mexico and if some of those go -- I think those are your swing factors, Joe, as you think about volumes. So, I hope that helped.
Joe Nolan: That’s very helpful detail. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Ward Nye: You bet. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Please ask your question.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. Great quarter, great outlook.
Ward Nye: Thank you so much Adam. Good to hear your voice.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, you talked about data center weakness in Q4. That surprised me. What are you seeing going forward there?
Ward Nye: Well, I'm not sure it was so much -- I was talking more broadly about what some of the writers have said. I think what I was saying is, in our world, it hasn't been as down as people would have thought. Now, keep in mind, it was against a really tough comp. So, that's more other than anything else. But if you just look at general trade publications, they're going to say, look, in warehousing and data center, you're going to start to see some moderation simply because the comps were so high. I guess my point was not all markets are going to be equal. And I think when we start looking at the Southeastern, Southwestern and interestingly, these Midwestern markets, where there's a lot of data center activity, which was why I was calling out, in particular, part of what's happening in Nebraska and Iowa because those have been actually really resilient markets in that particular space, Adam. So, it was something I was really calling up high degrees of weakness. It was more comps are tough and the overall commentary around that is a little bit softer than in some other areas. But again, I think we're holding up better than most.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then clients ask me this, I'll just ask you, are we still early and you guys seeing the benefit from IIJA?
Ward Nye: Yes, I think -- look, I think if we're talking about that in innings, I mean we're in the very early innings of that. I mean, I think as a practical matter, 2024 is really the first year that we're going to start to see significant stone go out the gate on IIJA. So, here's the way I would think of it, Adam. 2024 on that is going to be better than 2023. 2025 is likely to be better than 2024, and I think 2026 could be better than 2025. So, in baseball parlance, we're not anywhere near the seventh inning stretch. I mean we're in a very healthy spot right now, and it's likely to be that way for a number of years.
Adam Thalhimer: Great answer. Thanks Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Ward for the closing remarks.

Martin Marietta once again delivered record results across nearly every financial and operational measure extending our long track record of industry-leading performance and responsible profitable growth. Thanks to the dedication of our colleagues across the enterprise, we achieved accompanying milestone by exceeding $2 billion in trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Our exceptional third quarter is highlighted by a 42% improvement in aggregates gross profit per ton despite lower shipments further validating the benefits of our value over volume commercial strategy and our commitment to operating with excellence, while meeting and exceeding our customers' needs. Importantly, while our work in continuous safety improvement is never done, I'm proud to report the company concluded our safest third quarter on record with total and lost time incident rates surpassing world-class levels. On another third quarter event it's notable that just yesterday on October 31 we finalized the sale of our Tehachapi California Cement plant substantially completing the planned asset sales from the 2021 Lehigh Hanson West acquisition. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, this divestiture of a non-strategic asset provides us with additional balance sheet flexibility to advance our well-articulated path of quality aggregates-led growth. As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, as pricing momentum will more than offset lower shipments and recently increased energy and related costs. Turning now to Martin Marietta's third quarter financial performance. We established all-time quarterly records across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $2 billion, a 10.1% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $676 million, a 38.6% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.94 of 48.6% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $705.2 million, a 32.3% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $7.89 of 42.4% increase. These results reinforce the durability of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically situated in well-curated geographies. These record results also reflect our team's focus on what we can control, despite heightened geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic headwinds, including growth restrictive monetary policy and continued inflation. Shifting now to our third quarter shipment and pricing results. Aggregate shipments declined 7.3%. Our value over volume strategy is clearly an unapologetic component of that result, as a softening demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, which was partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive with pricing increasing 20% or 17.2% on a mix adjusted basis, as we continue to expect fair value for our depleting resources. Near sold-out Texas cement conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, continue to drive strong product demand in a favorable commercial environment. Third quarter cement shipments of 1.1 million tons were flat to last year's comparable period and pricing grew 18.9%, as we continue to largely sell as much as we can produce. We expect favorable Texas Cement pricing dynamics will continue and accordingly announced a $15 per ton price increase effective January 1. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3.6%, while pricing improved a solid 20.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 5.7% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and a preliminary view of 2024, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning, everyone. The Building Materials business posted record quarterly revenue of $1.92 billion, a 10.5% increase over last year's third quarter and record quarterly gross profit of $649.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 38.4%. Aggregates gross profit improved to 32.1% relative to the prior year period to a record $440.6 million, as pricing growth more than offset lower shipments and higher production costs, underscoring the strength and effectiveness of our value-over-volume commercial strategy, as a distinguishing hallmark to grow profitability through economic cycles. The business also achieved an aggregate gross profit margin of 36.2%, setting a new all-time profitability record despite the shipment decline. Our Texas Cement business also extended its track record of outstanding performance. Revenues increased 18.3% to $199.1 million, while gross profit increased 61.5% to $108.7 million. Pricing growth and lower energy costs, more than offset higher raw materials and maintenance costs. Domestic production capacity constraints and robust demand continue to drive extremely tight supply particularly in North Texas. As a reminder, Martin Marietta has taken two notable steps to increase our Texas Cement production capacity to capitalize on the supply-demand dynamics. First, we've homely converted our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement also known as Type 1L, at both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants. This conversion not only reduces our carbon footprint, but also expanded our production capacity by approximately 10%. Second, our Midlothian Texas plant is installing a new finish mill, providing 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity. This project should be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024. As previously discussed, we began utilizing the new silos to low customer trucks in July. In addition to increasing cement storage capacity by over 60%, these silos have considerably enhanced the customer experience by reducing lot cycle times and are saving our customers up to an hour at peak shipping times each day. Our concrete revenues increased 25.3% to $285.2 million and gross profit increased 81.8% to $34.1 million, driven primarily by steady volume growth pricing gains and mega project contributions which more than offset higher upstream raw material and delivery costs. Our asphalt and paying revenues increased 14.6% on $359.9 million and gross profit increased 33% to $66.1 million, reflecting higher selling prices and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $75.5 million in the third quarter in line with the prior period and gross profit increased 3.6% to $21.4 million, softening demand in certain Magnesia end markets including TPO roofing and metal lining was more than offset by commercial and operational excellence initiatives and energy tailwinds. We expect demand to soften due to labor unrest in the automotive sector and Magnesia end-markets remaining weak in the fourth quarter and as such have reduced our Magnesia Specialties full year gross profit guidance. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase to our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, demonstrating its confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.96. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times as of September 30th, representing balance sheet strength and flexibility to responsibly grow through quality acquisitions and prudent capital investments, while returning capital to Martin Marietta to shareholders. To conclude my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that the record-breaking financial performance of this quarter and year-to-date has demonstrated a disciplined execution of our value over volume commercial strategy yields higher margins, higher profits and higher cash flow without the benefit of growing volumes. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2024, we remain confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals across our coast-to-coast footprint, specifically infrastructure demand from increased federal and state level investments and heavy industrial projects of scale should counterbalance headwinds in the light nonresidential and historically underbuilt residential sectors, which are more sensitive to tightening credit conditions and higher for longer interest rate expectations. In the third quarter, infrastructure accounted for 39% of total shipments, predictably building to a higher and more normalized portion of our overall business. The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand is meaningfully higher year-over-year. These infrastructure contract awards grew 18% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period, ending September 30, 2023. Collectively, we anticipate that the historic increase in public sector investment from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, record state departments of transportation budgets and voter-approved state and local transportation ballot initiatives will provide sustained multiyear demand to this aggregates intensive often countercyclical end market. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 33% of our third quarter shipments. Heavy side energy and manufacturing projects of scale continue to drive demand in this segment, as warehouse and data center construction continues to moderate from the post-COVID period. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States continues to trend favorably with the August season adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $198 billion at 66% increase from the August 2022 value of $120 billion. The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS act together with significant private investments, provide funding certainty for these large-scale manufacturing and energy projects that we believe will be disproportionately and positively impactful in Martin Marietta markets. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these large projects and with the successful execution of our commercial and operational excellence strategies will do so in a manner that is margin accretive. Moving to white non-residential, while third quarter shipments remained resilient, we expect the recent interest rate acceleration together with tighter commercial lending conditions may impact future demand. That said, the anticipated softness in this segment should be partially offset by the extended cycle and strength of the more aggregates intensive heavy nonresidential sector. Softening in the residential end market, which accounted for 23% of aggregate shipments this quarter, is expected to continue, driven by current mortgage rates which are nearing 23-year highs at 8%. While single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand signaled a near-term bottom and inflection point over the summer, the current higher rates are exacerbating affordability challenges and driving our revised expectations of soft demand in this end market. Nonetheless, we fully expect this current single-family housing slowdown will reverse once home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium, as demand far exceeds supply across key Martin Marietta markets, the result of significant underbuilding over the last decade and homeowners' reluctance to abandon low-rate mortgages. As we look to 2024, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments will be effectively flat as increased infrastructure investment coupled with robust activity from heavy non-residential projects of scale should help balance expected softness in interest rate sensitive private construction end markets. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will be supported by 2023 exit rates as well as the realization of our previously announced January 1, 2024 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low-double-digit growth in aggregates pricing and another year of profitable growth in 2024. To conclude, our team achieved impressive results in nearly every aspect of our business against a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. One of Martin Marietta enduring qualities is our proven ability to adapt quickly and respond effectively and durably to changing circumstances. Accordingly, we are extremely proud of our company's exceptional safety, operational and financial performance through the first nine months of 2023. Moreover, our record-setting third quarter performance, together with our fourth quarter expectations, reinforce our confidence that we will deliver our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $2.1 billion on organic improvement of $500 million or 31% over 2022. Through the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, we intend to continue driving responsible and profitable growth in 2023 and into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi. Thank you for taking my question today. Just following-up on the value over volume is clearly is showing through with the pricing performance this quarter and throughout the year. But it can have an impact on relative market share, because it's principally you're willing to give up some volume and for secure pricing. So could you discuss how it's working and speaks to what it means to relative market share and how it affects your business not just only now but a bigger picture over the next several years? Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet. Kathryn thanks for the question. So, several things. Can it affect degrees of tonnage going out the gate? Yes, it can. So if we're looking at the tonnage down this quarter versus the prior year quarter probably a little bit less than half of that was due to value over volume. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. We've got depleting reserves. That said, on average, we've got 70 years of reserves at current extraction rates. So we've got a long-lived business. But we know the reserves are worth more in the ground tomorrow than they are today. And if we're looking at really where we're seeding some share on, it tends to be lower-margin products. In other words things like base and fines. So part of what we're trying to do is we're talking with our customers to make sure that they understand really twice a year is something that we're looking at on revisiting our pricing. The other thing that's important to keep in mind relative to aggregates, and this is different from some other functions as well. It doesn't have to be a 24/7 business. In fact, in most of our locations, it's not and where you've got 24/7 businesses incremental volume can give a high degree of operating leverage. That's just not something with which we're encumbered, in aggregate. So we shut down each evening, and open up each morning and that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility. And then probably most importantly, Kathryn, when the volume does come back and by the way it typically does. It typically comes back at higher pricing. So, you can see the math. I mean the value over volume strategy works, it protects our reserves. It protects the longevity of our business. And it's something that we've been very clear, with our team is important to us and part of what you can see in the numbers is, that it's coming through. So, I hope that's responsive, Kathryn. Thank you for the question.
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. And just one quick follow-up with the sale of the California Cement asset, do you speak to just general state of your Texas Cement operations our inventories relative to demand? Have you seen any changes? Just to kind of that business, as you plan for next year.
Ward Nye: Thanks for the question. As you know, when we went into cement in Texas, we said, we view that as a strategic cement business. And my prepared comments said, we sold a non-strategic asset in California. And we set strategic cement for set where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated where we have a downstream business taking a significant portion of it in Texas it's about 30%, and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water. Our Texas Cement business is very solid. And part of the reason on it is, it's in Dallas-Fort Worth and it's in San Antonio. So, it removed from the vicissitude of imports largely. So what we're seeing in that marketplace and what you saw in the quarter, is volumes were largely flat because we're broadly sold out. And we continue to largely sell, what we're producing. And part of what we're anticipating and part of what we've announced, is a $15 a ton price increase for cement effective January 1. So, I think that -- those data points give you, a good snapshot of where Texas Cement is today.
Kathryn Thompson: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. 
Trey Grooms: Thanks and good morning.
Ward Nye: Hi, Trey.
Trey Grooms: So, maybe sticking to the pricing theme here particularly in aggregates. If you could maybe talk through your initial 2024 aggregates pricing outlook of low double digits growth that you've laid out, and maybe unpack how much you have coming from carryover 2023 midyear increases, and how you're setting the stage for low double digits price improvement in 2024?
Ward Nye: Happy to try. Thanks for that. So we're thinking about the 2024 guide, similar to the way that we did the 2023 guide. What I mean by that, is the guide that we've given I think this is more to stay out immediately, does not include any midyears and again, just as we saw in 2023, we think we're going to have mid-years in 2024. But right now, the guide that we've given, does not assume that. So, I think that's important. Secondly, as I indicated in the previous question, we think midyears are becoming more and more the norm, with our customers and we think the expectations have been set, the customer letters that have gone out indicate that pricing is largely effective from January 1 to June 30. So in the correspondence that has already gone, people know that we're going to protect them through midyear. Now, in fairness there's a footnote to that. And the notable exception is California, where our pricing letters already include announced midyear so that our customers can plan for that in that marketplace. We've long talked about what we inherited when we bought the business in California and we're trying to address that. Just to be clear, California totaled 2024 increases right now look like that's going to be about $4 a ton across all products and markets, as we continue to implement that strategy in particular in what's a relatively new marketplace for Martin Marietta. Now to your point, if we're thinking about the way carryovers are going to work carryovers next year are probably going to be in the low single-digits so a little bit lower than they were this year. But again, we've got a lot of confidence in what we think we will come out with on January 1. And then, again, if we have something that even begins to replicate what we saw in midyear next year and frankly there's probably some upside to that Trey. So I think that gives you a good build on the way that we see that working based off exit rates in 2023.
Trey Grooms: Yeah. Super helpful Ward. Thank you so much and good luck.
Ward Nye: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone and congratulations. Can you guys talk about what you guys are seeing on the M&A front? I mean, historically, you've done a nice job strategically expanding the footprint. Leverage the 18% free cash flow cement sale even better by year-end. What is the M&A market looking like these days?
Ward Nye: Stanley, thanks for the question and for the comments on the quarter. The M&A market is actually looking increasingly attractive. The level of dialogue has ramped up in the second half of this year. From my perspective, that wasn't a tremendous surprise. As you know, 2021 was a big year for M&A for us. And part of what we've been doing, since then is a lot of what you saw in today's announcement relative to the sale of Tehachapi, making sure we're getting our pricing right in different markets making sure we're getting our hands around the operations. And now, as we sit here today, several things are apparent. Number one, we're looking at a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. So that's below our targeted range. Two, you can see from the financials what the cash flow in this organization looks like that can clearly help fuel and will fuel some aggregates led frankly from my perspective pure aggregate transactions. And then two or three, when we had the proceeds that have just come in from Tehachapi, it puts us in a very attractive place. Do I think we'll have anything to announce here in the rest of this year? Probably not. Do I hope that we'll have some things that we can announce early next year? I think that we will. So, more to come on that Stanley. But again, we like financially where we're sitting. We like strategically where we're sitting. We like what we believe or what we know we can do from a regulatory perspective because we think that's a differentiator right now. So we believe that we can continue to give you price. We believe we can continue to give you really good cost control. And we believe we can keep giving you good solid attractive M&A. And we think that's a hattrick that we can offer today.
Stanley Elliott: Great. Thanks so much and best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Hi. Just pulling together what you shared in your preliminary comments double-digit pricing growth, flat volumes, embedding call it high single-digit COGS per unit growth. I mean, that essentially gets you to roughly $200 million of aggregate profit growth 2024 versus 2023 which is I think probably consistent with the consensus growth expectations for total company EBITDA 2024 versus 2023. So I know you're not providing your full 2024 outlook here, but it does feel like you're giving us the pieces to get the consensus EBITDA numbers with probably higher profitability and lower volumes than what folks expected on a bottom on basis. Is that fair? And any other puts and takes that you would add?
Ward Nye: Yes, I think, that's relatively fair. And if you think about it Jerry I think that's what we did in Q2 and I think that's what we've done in Q3. I mean I think part of what you're seeing is the world can go through different degrees of economic turmoil and this is a business that continues to be very steady very durable in all forms of markets. So I don't disagree at all. I'll turn it over to Jim in just a moment so he can add if there are any particular things that he wants to make sure he calls out. But one of the things that I think is worth noting Jerry, I mean, did energy help us this quarter? Absolutely it did. But I think part of what's so striking to me is even if we did not have the energy tailwind that we did this quarter we would have set new records this quarter anyway. And I think it's so important because I know what you're looking for those puts and takes I wanted to go ahead and address that one upfront because, while in the quarter that was powerful. It would have been a very powerful quarter even without that. Jim anything you want to add?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. No it's just that the cost inflation continues to moderate slightly still elevated compared to historical levels. But again as we've demonstrated this year, we expect it to happen next year pricing growth exceeds cost inflation. So we do expect margins to expand next year.
Jerry Revich: Super. And can I just follow-up the downstream businesses you folks are executing really well this year how much of that has been because of a helpful move in diesel and liquid asphalt versus what's sustainable in the new portfolio particularly on the ready-mix side post the divestiture?
Ward Nye: Yes, Jerry, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One if you think about our ready-mix business it's almost uniquely in Texas and Arizona. And those are two very good markets. And one reason that they're good is look you're in New York if you look at your window you're going to see asphalt streets and when you get to the bridges you'll have concrete bridges. If you're in Texas you're writing on concrete roads and concrete bridges and you're building things structurally with concrete as well. So those markets tend to be more durable from a supply perspective because again you've got that really non-cyclical or often countercyclical infrastructure market that will place some meaningfully in in our ready-mix business. And clearly ASP was up 20% in ready-mix. That helped a lot but frankly volume was up very modestly. And again Texas is 80% of our volume in ready-mix. Now alternatively, if you go to HMA give you a sense of that's going to be full year probably about nine million tons. So it's a fairly notable business. Now practically speaking, it's in three places. It's in Minnesota, it's up and down the Rocky Mountains and it's in California. And what we saw there was ASP was up 6.7% because liquid wasn't moving as much. But the fact was Q3 was an all-time record of almost 3.9 million tons for us in asphalt. And keep in mind asphalt's going to be about 95% crushed down. So from our perspective that's a very attractive business, particularly, in Minnesota where as you recall Jerry it's largely an FOB business. So it's truly a material business for us there. And of that nine million tons, Minnesota is going to be a little bit over $3 million of it. So at least those are the quick puts and takes that we've got on that. Jim anything you want to add on that?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. I mean, obviously, the bitumen pricing costs did help the asphalt pay business. improve margins. It wasn't wholly due to that of course. But on the ready mixed side I would say was very, very little additive from the lower energy costs. So hopefully that answers the question too just rounding out what Ward provided.
Jerry Revich: It does. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jerry and take care.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: Hey. Ward, you talked about some softness in ag in the quarter in the Southwest and the Midwest, if I heard that right. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Was that weather driven or maybe a specific end market? Just wondering if there's any carryover into 4Q or potential reads into 2024?
Ward Nye: Thanks for the question. We had a couple of things. One in the Southwest, frankly, you had a lot of heat and the heat slowed some things down and you also had some timing relative to the large energy projects as well. So I see a lot of that being pushed off to the right. I mean clearly and it's not just the Southwest or Midwest issue. There are some degrees of softening relative to warehousing and data centers. I mean that's not a surprise. We anticipated that. But what we are seeing is a nice renaissance relative to manufacturing and then the timing of energy coming. Energy is not one of those issues that we have any concerns about. It's just relative to pace. So I think more than anything we had degrees of timing and we had certain degrees of softness that, from my perspective were broadly anticipated. And I think that's one of the reasons that when we were giving you our results at half year, part of what we indicated to you, is we thought we would probably see a near-term nature in volumes in the third quarter. So if we're looking at the way Q3 worked from our perspective Anthony, honestly, no big surprises including the way the pull-through came through and some -- obviously some very attractive incrementals in the quarter.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful. I’ll turn it over.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. And obviously, your price -- your value over volume approach is showing in your results. But I'm just curious how much line of sight do you have on your aggregate pricing in 2024? How are your competitors behaving in this environment? Is that value over volume approach potentially at risk tier volumes? The reason why I ask is because one of your bigger competitors calling for perhaps weaker volumes than your flattish outlook. So I just want to understand how the competitive landscape is behaving on pricing?
Ward Nye: Well, the things that we stay focused on Phil is what can we control and how do we run our business and we do that based on what our needs are. So we're very focused on Martin Marietta. We're focused on where operations are we're focused on what our inventories look like. We're focused on what our reserves look like in the ground. And we're focused on what we feel like the market can bear relative to these products. So our perspective, those are really the unique drivers on that. As I indicated before, if you're looking at volumes for the quarter were our volumes down a little bit more than others yes probably, so are we okay with that? You bet. Do I feel like that's probably going to find more degrees of equilibrium going forward? I think it probably will. At the same time, if I'm looking at the geographies in which we tend to be focused, let's face it we're talking about Texas, that's going to be awfully good. I mean we're looking at a Texton budget for FY 2024 that it exceeds $18.5 billion. I mean that's just a massive budget in Colorado, recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, that's going to be massive in that state here in North Carolina and it was something that I'm proud to have been part of the project. We structurally change the way that we're paying for infrastructure here. Now we're using a degree of sales taxes. And in FY 2024, it's going to ramp up to 4% here in North Carolina, because North Carolina recognized they needed to increase their spending by over $7 billion over the next decade. But even separate distinct from that, if we're looking in Florida right now, Florida is looking at a $17.2 billion budget for FY 2024 and that's an all-time record. And I feel like I've said for probably the last six or seven years, that every year is an all-time record for transportation in Florida, largely because it has been. And in California where we brought that new business the Caltrans budget is $20.5 billion next year. Now to give you a sense of it, that's a 5.5% or 5.6% year-over-year increase with $12.1 billion designated for highway and bridge capital spending. So as we're thinking about what that public funding looks like and we're coming back and looking at what's happening industrially in places like Atlanta what's going on in South Georgia, literally just yesterday, Toyota announced they're adding $8 billion to what is already a large battery plant that's underway in Randolph County that's just downside of Greensboro. These are the types of things that we're seeing in our markets both in public and heavy non-res that gives us a lot of confidence around the way that we think volumes will work next year. And the fact is with the footprint that we have, I don't have any doubt that we're going to get our fair share of that business. I just want to make sure that we're doing for what we feel like is fair value for that business.
Phil Ng: Super. And Ward, you mentioned maybe some of the weakness recently is tied to some of these bigger projects whether its energy mega products, getting pushed out. Can you give us a little perspective when you see that kind of ramping up? Is that early next year middle part of next year? And then on the public infrastructure side, we could all appreciate there's a lot of money coming. How do you kind of see that ramping up and building into 2024?
Ward Nye: Yeah. Phil, those are great questions. I think on the public infrastructure side, we're still where we were. We said, we thought we would start to see that building in for and then build into 2024 -- when I say four, I mean Q4 of this year. And that was part of what led us to the commentary around the fact that we thought we'd probably see this type of dip in Q3. So again very anticipated, if we're looking for example at the large LNG projects, part of what we're seeing right now is several projects that are already underway. Golden Pass is underway, Chevron Phillips has a large facility in Orange, Texas that's underway, Port Arthur LNG, at least portions of that are underway, Cheniere has a lot this underway. But if we look going forward, I can think of at least four big jobs and I think this gives you a sense from a timing perspective in Texas that we're watching. Cheniere has another one in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. We are grand LNG in Brownsville and Freeport LNG in Texas, all are looking at we believe 2024 start dates. We're actually anticipating some acceptance of materials maybe as soon as this week on some of those projects. So it continues to be a live conversation. So if we think about it for the year has timing been a little bit of a headwind on those, yeah, it has. Do we think they're going away? Absolutely not. And part of what we're seeing and frankly in degrees this is helpful, you've got degrees of material tightness in some of those markets and that continues to underscore at least the notion of the overall economy in Texas today. So I hope that gives you a snapshot at least on some of the heavy non-recipe.
Phil Ng: Appreciate the great color.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.
Timna Tanners: Yes. Hey good morning everyone.
Ward Nye: Hi Timna.
Timna Tanners: I want to follow up on one would just appreciate that...
Ward Nye: Timna, I'm sorry to interrupt you. We're having a hard time hearing you. Can you lean that a little bit more please?
Timna Tanners: Yes. Is that better?
Ward Nye: Yes ma'am, it is. Thank you.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Sorry about that. So I appreciate the commentary on big projects and starting up in 2024. We have heard some delays and cost overruns. So does that affecting your geographies perhaps as much? Or are you budgeting for that as well?
Ward Nye: I don't think, they're affecting number one our geographies that much and two, to the extent that inflation or varying degrees of it continues to go through. Frankly, if we can keep up with that or stay ahead of it Timna, it's actually been an ally to our business, not an enemy to our business. So I do think if we had a strikingly different geographic profile then we have, I would probably feel differently about it than I do. But if we go back to that conversation I was having just a little while ago relative to our leading states and the degree of both public and private activity that we're seeing in Texas and Colorado and the Carolinas and Georgia and Florida. Those are very powerful steady markets right now. And I'm even taken to by the continued resiliency in markets like Indiana and in Iowa as well. Iowa is a state that has been very steady all the way through cycles for us including probably the single most steady market in which we participated during the great financial crisis. So, I just call that out, because it's one of those states that doesn't come to mind immediately, if you're in New York or Chicago or Dallas or Los Angeles thinking about this industry. But it's been one that for us that's been actually quite important and very durable.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Helpful. And then just on the commentary on M&A. I know in the past you would have hoped to have some done by the end of this year now talking about next year. Is that just a timing issue? Or is there anything that you can share there?
Ward Nye: It's more of a timing issue than anything else, Timna. Obviously, you know what the process looks like. You're going to have dialogue with a potential company you want to acquire, you'll go through a valuation process, you might go through a letter of intent contracting and then you also have regulatory processes that you have to go through. And none of that's easy, but our team is essentially very good at it, but we're going to be thoughtful as we do it. So it's not the fact that you haven't seen more done is not indicative of anything other than it's just an ordinary process. Now part of what's been different too in fairness, we're typically not in the selling business. And we've been in the selling business for the last 1.5 years more than we ordinarily would be. And you've seen what we've done relative to the reading plant in Northern California, the tax replan in Southern California and even relative to our ready-mix business in Colorado. I mean, if you think back to it between Stockton, Reading to Tehachapi and our Colorado business that we sold, that's over $1 billion worth of divestitures. And that's not ordinary for us. But again we talk about the fact that, it's an aggregates-led business. And when we talk about cement, we talk about a strategic cement business. So -- some years most years we're going to be busier buying than selling. The last 1.5 years we've actually had more on the sell side than on the buy side for all the right reasons.
Timna Tanners: Got it. Thanks, again.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Tyler Brown: Hi. Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Tyler
Tyler Brown: I want to come back to cost a little bit. So it feels like costs are -- they're obviously remaining fairly sticky here. You mentioned a little bit of easing. So just specifically, where are you seeing some of that moderation? Are you seeing in labor consumables, is maintenance starting to roll? Just a little bit of color there, would be helpful.
Ward Nye: Sure. I'll tell you, what I'll do I'll turn it to Jim, and ask him to come back and give you more granularity. If you think about overall cost, I mean have we seen supplies go up mid-single digits, yes. Have repairs gone up low double digits, yes, and contract services as well. But Jim, can give you a little bit more color on that.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. It's largely the same story as before, which is a continuing slow moderation in cost inflation, still elevated versus historical levels, slowly coming back to normal from where it was very elevated, but it still remains elevated. I would say, the most problematic areas are parts costs are still quite high. I don't see those coming down for a bit. But labor is behaving more and more normal, as we go on. But otherwise, I'd say, high single digits mid- to high single digit is the right way to think about it for the rest of this year getting a little bit better moderating next year. Again, I'm holding aside energy, which is very volatile and just holding that one aside because we don't know where that ends up going. Does that answer your question?
Tyler Brown: Yes. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate it.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Your next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. 
Ward Nye: David, are you there?
David MacGregor: I'm here now. Sorry, about that. I apologize. Congratulations, on a great quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks so much David.
David MacGregor: Yes, I just wanted to sort of revisit the slide in your deck, on highway contract awards up 18%. And I get your thoughts in terms of what's changing in the lag from awards to stone demand and stone shipments?
Ward Nye: Yes. No, I think it's been Dave from my perspective, a fairly predictable and I think in large measure because we went for such an extended period of time, without more money coming from the federal government in a meaningful way on that. So, if you think about what happened, we had a decade plus of continuing resolutions. Then we had the FAST Act, that didn't have more money, but it did have more time. And so now what's happened is, you've had that very attractive double whammy of hey, here comes more money. Here comes more time. And you also had DOTs who had actually been building up their own budgets, for about 15 years because they weren't getting more money and more time from the federal government. So I think what we're going to see particularly in Martin Marietta states is, it's not so much driven by maintenance and repair. It's going to be more driven by bringing in new capacity. And that's important for a number of reasons. Number one, our states have had a lot of people move to them. So, if we're simply looking at overall population trends, I mean it's pretty eye-popping to think about the fact that, Texas has led all the states and population gains over the past decade adding four million people. If we're looking at Colorado, their population has grown 14.8% just since 2010. And mean North Carolina has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country. Georgia is going to move up to number 8 in the country in population. So if you think about, why these states need to add capacity, as opposed to maintenance and repair. That's a big reason. And if you're thinking about what happens from a lag perspective, on rather than putting new asphalt, on top of old asphalt but rather adding a new lane or building new roads, it frankly takes a little bit longer. Now, the punchline is it ends up being considerably more aggregates intensive. So, for us, it's like a big birthday. It's worth the wait sometimes. So, we feel like good things are coming from this but I think that's really driving that lag that we've seen the dollars are there. And you can see where they are. You can see what the state DOT budgets are. But again I think it's those states those budgets those population inflows that are driving a different nature of construction. What we'll see in Charlotte, what we'll see in Atlanta, what we'll see in Dallas is going to be a very different story than what you'll see in New York or what you'll see in Chicago.
David MacGregor: Great. Thanks very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Good morning Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Dudas: You've been terrific observations about the markets and some of the puts and takes heading into end of this year 2024. Just wondering as you look at the residential side of the business in your important states it seems -- we're at a -- is that the flywheel that could impact positively expectations on volume given it seems like we're at a bottom or in this kind of longer base bottom given the affordability issues. Is that kind of where the help could come if volumes could get better? And is that a market that you'd be able to take advantage of given your positioning in your -- certainly your backlog and your ability to serve?
Ward Nye: Yes. Look, I think the answer Michael is yes and yes to all of the above. It's interesting because you've got two issues relative to housing in the United States today. We've talked about one of them and that is affordability and clearly seeing mortgage rates move to 23-year highs drive some of that. The other issue that doesn't get the airtime that it probably should but it does in our states is availability. And that's a big issue today. And single-family housing in the US is structurally underbuilt. I mean it's a practical matter it ought to be trending comfortably over one million starts a year at least as we drill it down to the markets in which most of our business is because again we're back to those population trends that I mentioned in the dialogue with Dave MacGregor just a few minutes ago. If you come to Raleigh, your biggest issue is can you find a house. Same issue in Charlotte. Same issue in Atlanta. In various degrees, the same issues in Dallas-Fort Worth and in Colorado today. So, to the extent that there could be some upside there. Could it be single-family housing-driven? I think so. And for example several things are happening. Our homebuilders looking at having their own mortgage companies within homebuilding companies? They are. Are they doing that because they want to keep building? They do. Do they want to keep building because they know the market is there? Absolutely. And in some instances are they building and basically building to rent even in the near-term because they recognize that they can do that. So, I think your point around a swing factor on housing is important. And I think it's relevant to say keep in mind single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates-intensive than is multifamily. So, if you're watching housing look is it nice to see multifamily go? Yes. Is it really nice to see single-family go? The answer is yes. But I think what we've just described is worth watching and could be a build in 2024. And I hope that helps Michael.
Michael Dudas: It sure does. Excellent Ward. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Great quarter. Two quick questions, getting late in the call. Two quick questions. One where do you want us for Q4 because the range is pretty wide. And I'm just curious if we wanted to bake in an early onset to winter where would that put us? And then the second question is do you ever see yourself recreating what you've built in Texas and other geographies?
Ward Nye: Well, that's two big questions for a guy late in the call today Adam. A couple of things. I'll take the second part of that. I'll leave the first part to Jim. Texas is a tremendous market. And when we bought TXI and when we've done some of the moves that we've made in Texas since then frankly we thought it was going to be that kind of a market. But at the same time we're in some other markets today that are enormously attractive. Do we think we can do some very great things in California? Yeah, I think we can. Can we continue to grow our business in places like Florida and still in Texas and in Tennessee and others? The short answer is yes. But one thing I think is so important for me to say Adam is you should expect us to continue to be an aggregates-led company. And I think that part of what is so evident in these numbers is again how durable that is. Now with respect to Q4, I'll pivot over to Jim and he can talk to you a little bit more about how we see some puts and takes on that. But frankly a lot of it is going to be driven by when does winter show up in different parts of our business. So Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah. So Q4 I would say look generally speaking look at the midpoint of whatever we put out that sort of -- the best way to think about it. What could push it to the bottom end? Ward mentioned obviously bad weather, rainy weather in Texas, early winter in the north part of our footprint. And then, of course, there's cost timing and shifts. There's nothing fundamentally happening that's troubling. Costs could shift from one quarter to the next causing volatility. It was slipped into Q1 that would help Q4. If they don't that would hurt Q4. So I think I'd just stick with the midpoint for now Adam and go with that.
Adam Thalhimer: Great. Thanks guys.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to Martin Marietta’s Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company’s website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.
Jennifer Park: Thank you. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today’s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward Nye will begin today’s earnings call with a discussion of our operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation, after which Ward will conclude with market trends and our outlook for the remainder of 2023. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Welcome everyone and thanks for joining this quarterly teleconference. I am pleased to report Martin Marietta’s exceptional performance across nearly every safety, financial and operational measure in the second quarter, which built upon our record first quarter performance. Given the overall challenging macroeconomic environment, including continued monetary policy tightening and the related residential housing slowdown, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team’s focus and resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also finalized the divestiture of our Stockton, California cement import terminal in the second quarter, further enhancing our company’s margin profile and improving the durability of our business through cycles. As indicated in today’s earnings release, we revised our 2023 guidance to reflect the company’s results from the first half of the year and our current expectations for the second half. Notably, we raised our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to range from $2 billion to $2.1 billion or a 28% increase at the midpoint as compared with the prior year. The core assumption underpinning the adjusted EBITDA guidance is that accelerated commercial momentum will more than offset lower shipments and higher costs as we endeavor to continue managing the last 2 years of historic inflation. Further, given the typical lag effect between single-family housing starts and aggregates demand, we expect recent aggregate shipments declines will find a bottom in the third quarter of 2023. Against that backdrop, Martin Marietta achieved strong second quarter results across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $1.82 billion, an 11% increase; consolidated gross profit of $560 million, a 32% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $596 million, a 25% increase; and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.80, a 28% increase. These stellar results reflect the continued disciplined execution of our strategic plan through economic cycles. Shifting now to our second quarter shipment and pricing results, starting with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 5.7% as we experienced the expected lag between last year’s decline in single-family housing starts and our shipments to the residential market. Predictably though, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 18.6% or 17% on a mix-adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Second quarter shipments were a record 1.1 million tons and pricing grew 21.8%. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and expect solid realization of the $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 1.7%, while pricing increased a robust 21.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 1.7% and pricing improved 7.9%. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our second quarter discussion with a review of the company’s financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good day to everyone. The Building Materials business posted record second quarter revenues of $1.74 billion, an 11.6% increase over last year’s comparable period and a quarterly gross profit record of $536.1 million, a 34.3% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 20.7% relative to the prior year period resulting in a quarterly record of $370.9 million as strong pricing growth and lower diesel fuel expenses more than offset lower shipments and increased non-energy-related costs. Our Texas cement business also continued its track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.7% to $197.7 million and gross profit increased 84% to $93.3 million. As previously discussed, our Midlothian, Texas plant is installing a new finish mill that we expect to be finished in the third quarter of 2024. Upon completion, the new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today’s sold-out Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace. This project will achieve its first major milestone this month as our new cement titles will begin loading customer trucks. The new silos and load-out system are dramatically improving customer service by reducing load-out cycle times by as much as 45 to 60 minutes per truck during periods of peak shipping. In addition, this project has increased cement storage capacity by over 60%. The process of converting our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as Type 1L is now complete at both our Midlothian and Hunter, Texas plants. We expect the Type 1L conversion to provide additional production capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022 and helped reduce our carbon footprint. Our ready-mix concrete revenues increased 19.7% to $271.4 million and gross profit increased 142.3% to $35.4 million, driven primarily by strong pricing gains in the quarter, more than offsetting higher upstream raw material costs. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 11.7% to $240.9 million and gross profit increased 37.9% to $36.5 million due to pricing improvement, coupled with lower bitumen costs as compared to the prior period. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $80.5 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year quarter and gross profit increased 13% to $27.7 million. Notably, gross margin increased 440 basis points from the prior year quarter to 34.4%, driven by pricing growth and moderating energy expenses. As a general matter, energy costs are down from last year’s highs and have now seemingly stabilized. Non-energy costs continue to grow at rates well above historical averages and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. That said, expected midyear price increases should serve to offset the expected cost inflation. During the quarter, we returned $116 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 178,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $422 per share in the second quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.1x, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. This balance sheet strength gives us ample flexibility to continue investing in the business and pursuing accretive acquisition opportunities, while at the same time, extending our long record of returning capital to Martin Marietta’s shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. With this year’s construction season well underway, we are confident in Martin Marietta’s bright prospects for the remainder of 2023. We continue to be encouraged by a number of factors that support sustainable demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy non-residential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the infrastructure investment in Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects for years to come. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated from any mild-to-moderate private sector contraction. We began with infrastructure, which accounted for 36% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is again meaningfully higher year-over-year, with growth of 25% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2023. Importantly, in addition to incoming IIJA funding, state legislatures are choosing to commit considerable investment to transportation projects. For example, Texas and North Carolina have directed portions of sales tax collections to infrastructure, while Florida is transferring general funds to augment State Department of Transportation resources. We expect this increase in public sector investment to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important often countercyclical end market. Moving now to non-residential construction, which represented 35% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. As warehouse construction has moderated from its post-COVID peak, other heavy industrial projects led by onshore manufacturing and energy continued to drive demand in this segment, accounting for the majority of total non-residential shipments. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States has accelerated to well above record levels as the MACE seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 is $194 billion, a 76% increase from the May 2022 value of $110 billion. Since 2021, supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act, private companies have announced over $500 billion in commitments to invest in critical sectors like semiconductors and electronics, electric vehicle and related batteries and clean energy as those projects are both economic and national security consequence. Further, the nation’s aim to be the global leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to drive substantial demand for new data centers for the foreseeable future. As a result, we expect an extended cycle within the aggregates intensive heavy non-residential sector. We also remain optimistic about Martin Marietta’s light non-residential end markets, where we have yet to experience any notable weakness as shipments to in-process projects continue. We are actively monitoring this portion of the segment, but expect any possible future softness to be partially offset by the relative strength of the more aggregates intensive, heavy non-residential project pipeline. Moving to residential. Shipments to this segment accounted for 24% of total aggregate shipments this past quarter. Given the structural housing deficit in key Martin Marietta markets, we correctly anticipated that the affordability-driven residential slowdown would be short-lived. Accordingly, we are encouraged by recent public homebuilder sentiment and single-family starts data, which are indicative of a near-term bottoming and inflection point. The significant underbuilding over the last decade, coupled with existing homeowners reluctance to abandon their low rate mortgages, is exacerbating the housing deficit, thus available home inventory is being disproportionately driven by new home construction, a notable trend that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting second quarter performance provides outstanding momentum and a solid foundation for the balance of the year. As a result, we are confident in our ability to achieve our raised 2023 financial guidance. We believe our most recent results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model and our team’s steadfast commitment to health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives will support our success. We remain focused on building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Ward, Jim.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Trey.
Trey Grooms: I guess I want to touch on the cement volume, Ward. It was – seeing it was actually up slightly year-over-year on a tough comp and it’s no secret that Texas weather wasn’t particularly favorable in the quarter. And granted, I think maybe cement can hold up a little bit better in bad weather than maybe aggregates or asphalt, but that’s still impressive. Could you give us a little more color on kind of the drivers there in Texas for cement what you are seeing there with those end markets? And with that, you mentioned you expect favorable traction on the midyear cement increase. Any additional color you could give us around that?
Ward Nye: Happy to, Trey. Thank you for the question. So first, you are right, it was weather in Texas. We had 20 weather-impacted days this quarter as opposed to 16 in the last quarter. I think what that does tell you is the essence of what you asked is right. That is cement because some of it is going to vertical construction as opposed to horizontal construction can actually weather better than aggregates can or asphalt can, because they are both going down literally on the ground in most instances. What I would say relative to the business, number one, it is very durable in Texas. If we go back to our definition of strategic cement, the business we have in Dallas and the business we have in San Antonio fits it perfectly. If we think about Texas as the market all by itself, North Texas is the single healthiest market in Texas. So if we look at the way Midlothian continues to perform and it’s performing very well. That was the single strongest cement performer that we had. That said, Hunter was a very solid performer as well. So if we are looking at overall volumes at 1.1 million tons, the important thing to remember is markets largely sold out. So in essence, short of that capital project coming through next year, we are basically running at capacity. So having a cement business in Texas with the biggest piece of it in Dallas-Fort Worth, running at capacity is a really good start for a cement business. The second part of your question was relative to the midyear, we have announced a $10 per ton midyear price increase in cement in Texas. We think we are going to get very good traction on that, so more to come on that as we come toward Q3, but again, a very solid performance by our team. They continue operationally to run that business extraordinarily well. Again, if you are looking at what the pricing has done. Q2 saw pricing up 21.8%, even if you look at mix adjusted, it was still over 21%. But as Jim outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to see in different parts of the business, degrees of inflation. So part of what we are trying to do with our pricing is stay at least even or try to do some catch-up on that. So Trey, I hope that’s responsive.
Trey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the color, Ward and keep up good work. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stanley Elliott: Hye, good morning, Ward, Jim. Thank you, guys for the question. Ward, I guess we’re getting halfway to the point of the SOAR ‘25 program you outlined a couple of years ago. Where do you think we are strategically from an overall perspective, and I say it in the context that now you have an infrastructure bill, there is other government programs that really weren’t on the table at that time? I’d just like to see how you’re thinking about things.
Ward Nye: Stanley, thanks for that question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about what we outlined is important. We talked about value over volume. If we’re looking at price cost spread, we’re 200 bps ahead of that today. So I think from that perspective, where we thought we would be. If we’re looking at bringing operational excellence to the enterprise, and we’re looking at the best safety metric rates at this time of year we’ve ever seen. If we’re looking at continued throughput and tons produced per working man hour, they continue to go up. But if we also take a look at what we said we would do relative to growing our business, the short answer is we’re ahead of plan on that. If in year 1 in 2021, we bought Tiller and Lehigh West. We spent year 2 really last year and the year before, doing portfolio shaping and really getting our leverage back down to the areas that we told you that we would. So keep in mind, in a post West Coast world, we are modestly over 3x levered. Today, we’re down to 2.1x. So when we’re looking at our range of debt to EBITDA to 2.5x, we’re actually the lower end of that. And then I think importantly, if we’re looking at the pipeline that we have today to continue growing our business, it’s a very attractive pipeline. And I think what’s important in that, Stanley, is it’s attractive in the areas that we’ve continued to say are most important to our business, and that’s back to the notion of an aggregates-led business. So again, if we’re measuring where we were from the perspective of, we said we thought during that 5-year period, we could double our market cap. Math tells me we’re like 60% plus there. and we’re about halfway through. So again, tactically, I like where we sit. If we look strategically on how we think it’s coming together. Look, I think at the end of the day, the plan works. So thank you so much for the question.
Stanley Elliott: Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.
Ward Nye: You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. I guess some good color on guidance, but just a couple of clarifications on the updated EBITDA guidance. pricing is improving, but volumes are adjusted given today’s results, they can step back. How much does pricing versus lower costs for certain categories playing the change? And what are you seeing in key end markets? We know Texas and North Carolina are key states that are doing quite well, but are there other end markets from a geographic standpoint that are contributing to the change in guidance? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Kathryn, thanks for the question, too. So look, if we’re looking at really what the drivers are, clearly, what we’re seeing relative to average selling price is the single largest driver that we have right now. If we’re looking at Q2 in aggregates up 18.6%, a really nice performance, obviously, in cement. We talked about that over 20% ready-mix, tracking the same thing. These are all important points relative to the revised EBITDA guidance. And it does give you a sense that in today’s world, pricing is actually considerably more powerful than volume is. And I think that’s, to me, in so many respects, part of what’s important to underline. To that end, if we’re looking at the volume and we’re seeing what some of the differences are several things are worth noting. One, relative to volume, we think in the quarter, we lost about 1 million tons simply due to weather. If you were here in the Mid-Atlantic, what you saw is the second half of June was, frankly, a washout. It rained nearly every day. So when the Carolinas and Georgia are feeling that we feel that on volume. I think importantly, too, if we’re looking at value over volume and what we think that cost us relative to volume for the quarter, we think that was probably about 1 million tons. And by the way, we think that was probably a pretty good trade. Equally, if we’re looking at what Jim and I both spoke to in our prepared comments and that is with respect to the residential market. Again, we think housing itself has found bottom, but we tend to lag in that on the stone finds us waiting new subdivisions. So we think we’re actually troughing in that as we sit here probably today going into the third quarter, we think that probably cost us about 0.5 million tons. So again, if you’re looking at what the drivers are going to be, will price be the disproportionate driver? Yes. Have we given up some volume on occasion intentionally and purposely because we feel like really holding firm on some of the pricing that we feel like is fair, is the right thing to do relative to our shareholders? We do. And then to the last part of your question relative to how different markets look, here’s what I would tell you. The Southeast remains strong. If we’re looking at the Carolinas, if we’re looking at Atlanta, if we’re looking at coastal markets in the East, they continue to be quite good. If we’re looking in Texas, in many respects, the results speak for themselves. But in particular, Dallas-Fort Worth in the North and Austin are strong. San Antonio and Houston are feeling degrees of residential weakness. I don’t think that’s a surprise any place. If we’re looking at Colorado, Colorado had a very wet June, as I mentioned, it was the wettest June on record. But if we’re looking in California and Arizona, here’s where we see really strong demand in Phoenix. We see strong demand in Southern California. The places that are a little bit weaker, it’s a little bit weaker in San Francisco Bay Area. We thought it would be coming into the year. It’s a little bit weaker in portions of the Midwest. Again, that’s a cold weather market that in many respects, it’s just starting to hit its stride right now. But modestly weaker there. But overall, if we’re doing a heat map across our markets in the United States, given how intentional we’ve been in building our business in areas that continue to have good population inflows, very good public spending and good private growth. We’re seeing better markets than not. And again, that’s not a big surprise to us, Kathryn. So again, I think I hit the points that you wanted to be raised, but I hope that helps.
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. Thanks very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Ward, I just wanted to maybe build on Kathryn’s question there about the time you walk through 1.5 million tons of displaced business that related to weather and other I guess I just wanted to get your assessment of maybe the totality of what you might be behind in terms of tonnage here just because of disruptive weather and construction projects generally running behind at this point of the year? And how much of that can realistically be captured in the second half of ‘23? And I guess just secondly, how much availability is there in the current transportation and handling infrastructure capacity to support the fourth quarter volume surge in seasonal markets if that’s an option, if that’s a possibility?
Ward Nye: David, good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, if I go through and telling them look, I think weather was 1 million. I think value over volume is another 1 million. I think residential market softening was probably 500,000. I think in some instances, frankly, just having availability of certain sizes was probably somewhere north of 500,000. So again, you start telling those up, you’re getting a lot closer to 3 million than 2 million by just some quick math. If I think about really what it looks like for the rest of the year, we did our best to try to capture in the revised guidance, how we thought that was going to play I do think it’s important to reemphasize what I said in the commentary. Look, I think we’re likely because of housing and the timing on housing defined volume in Q3, the most challenged of the year. I think so. Do I think we’re likely to see an inflection in 4. I do in large measure because last year’s 4 was not a particularly compelling fourth quarter. And again, as we see the build go through 3, I think we’ve taken a very measured view. And of course, it’s easier to do it in late July than it is in late February on how the year is going. So I think we’ve captured pretty well how we think volume is going to play out for the rest of the year. And the other thing that I think is worth keeping in mind, David, is the way pricing is working now and how we see that working for the rest of the year. Because keep in mind, part of what happens at this time of year, as we report Q2 is the central part of the United States that tend to be cold weather markets, but equally don’t tend to be as high priced markets as some of the ones that we have on the East Coast simply rolled in. So what do I mean by that? Aggregates cost more in Charlotte than they do in Cincinnati. So remember, you’re always going to have a little bit of an optical headwind relative to pricing at half year. So again, as we think about volume, we feel like we’re in a perfectly good place on volume, and we think it’s going to build going into 4. We really like the way pricing has worked. And keep in mind, we took so much of our pricing and accelerated that first price increase from January and April, almost exclusively to January. So you had a number of different themes that are in play that in some respects, the market is seen for the very first time in this quarter, at least through an annual snapshot. But David, what I try to do is give you a sense of how we think volumes will build, how we think the pricing is going to come back to support that. And I think it’s important to note that we saw midyear price increases in over half of our markets. And I think if somebody had thought that’s what Martin Marietta is going to see when we came out with our guidance in February, I think they would have been very pleased with that. an I know we are as a management team.
David MacGregor: And just on that Ward, normally, your mid-year pricing would be mid to high 20s traction. In this environment, are we likely to see higher traction rates on these mid-years this year?
Ward Nye: I think the traction rate will actually be good on the midyears. And as I’m sitting here looking at the guide, honestly, if I’m wondering if there is some place that we might be a little bit light on it, it may be on that pricing guide. I think the pricing is going to actually look really good for the year. And I think we can exit the year probably in some instances, pretty close to a 20 figure this year, David.
David MacGregor: Great. Thanks very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Thank you. Hi, good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: What I wonder if you could just pick up the discussion where you just left off in terms of the carryover effect of the mid-year price increases? So essentially, with the bulk of the benefits coming in 2024. Can you talk about what level of price carryover effect will we just naturally have in ‘24 before taking into account the January 1 price increase based on the magnitude and the traction of the mid-years?
Ward Nye: Yes, Jerry, that’s a great question. I don’t want to go into specific details on that yet because, obviously, we will come out early next year and give good guidance for 2024. But I think several things are worth thinking, Jerry. One, do I think it will give us a nice carryover into ‘24? The answer is yes. Do I think we will end up seeing good price increases in January that will help build on that? The answer to that again is yes. So I think what we’re seeing is a pricing cycle right now that’s going to be better than the pricing cycle that you’ve typically seen even separate and apart from what has been a pretty high inflationary market. In other words, if you go back and look at what aggregates were doing at a normal rhythm and cadence even prior to the last, say, 1.5 years. I think what you can expect going forward is going to outkick that coverage that you would have historically seen. So again, do I think midyear help with that? I do. Do I think the price increases that will come back in, in January will help build upon that? Yes. And do I think we’re going to continue to see good sticking on the midyears that we put in place this year. And the answer to that is, again, a resounding, yes, Jerry. So I think from an outlook perspective, pricing has always been something that people have looked to Martin Marietta and said it broadly works. And I think what they are going to come to the conclusion of is it’s going to work in the future even better than it has in the past. And I think that’s saying something.
Jerry Revich: And Ward, in one of the prepared materials that you folks have for the call, you spoke about pretty low pricing starting point in California on the assets that you just acquired. Can you just talk about the pricing path and the decision not to put even more substantial price increases considering where the starting point is for that asset?
Ward Nye: So I guess I just want to make sure that my writing was clear in some instances, maybe wasn’t. What we’re saying is we’ve seen, since we bought that business, ASPs up around $4.50 a ton in that marketplace. And by the way, that was a marketplace that – and we’ve talked about it, Jerry, it was below Martin Marietta corporate average in a state that typically sees higher pricing. So seeing aggregate up since we’ve acquired that business about $4.50 a ton. We think given the barriers to entry, we think with the reserve depletion plays at the California sees generally, that’s a very responsible place for us to be on moving that. The other thing that I’ll tell you is as we’re sitting here now, we’re expecting probably another $2 a ton when we start getting closer to January 2024. So just as we’ve seen in different markets, when we bring the commercial philosophy to a business over an extended period of time, the pricing and the commercial aspects of the business tend to work quite well. And again, I haven’t been surprised by anything that we’ve seen in California, and I’m pretty pleased with where that business is going. And the other piece of it, Jerry, that you’ve watched very carefully is our team has been superb at managing what we’ve had in discontinued operations since we bought the business. So as you can tell, there is very little left now in disc ops. And again, we’ve been very intentional in skinning that business down to what we do, what we do best, very focused and our work there, frankly, is almost done and the commercial aspects of clearly work. So Jerry, I hope that helps.
Jerry Revich: Absolutely. Thank you, Ward. And can I ask just one last one? Jim, in terms of COGS per ton for aggregates, it looks like they were up about 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. I’m wondering any items that you’d call out because diesel, I think, should have been a tailwind. Obviously, volumes were down, but any other factors that impacted...
Ward Nye: Let me ask Jim to respond to that. So what you’re going to hear is energy is a good guy. And then there is some other things that are a bit of a headwind.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. No, the non-energy cost inflation is still with us, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, but things that are also above and beyond that, we did ship more tons via rail this quarter and the rate per ton on those rails shipped stone was higher as well. So that had a disproportionate effect. And again, it’s only quarter so it’s an outsized effect but that was a big piece of it as well as additional repairs costs that we incurred in the quarter. So those are the two things that will probably help drive that number up a bit, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Got it. Thank you. And congrats to the team.
Ward Nye: Jerry, thanks so much. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Wondering about cement gross margin. It’s at an all-time high at this point. And I know you’re adding the finishing mill next year to Midlothian. But conceptually, has the margin structure in that business been changed for the long-term?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Jerry, it’s Jim – Garik, sorry. It definitely has changed. I think the margins you’re seeing today are not anomalous. I would expect them to continue. The only thing that might affect that is if we saw a spike in natural gas prices, of course. But that’s – I would say at this point, it’s performing where we like it at. We think there is other ways to improve it further down the road, but I would view today’s margins as repeatable and enduring.
Ward Nye: And to that end, part of what the team has done so well in Texas. They have been focused on reliability. They have been focused on utilization. And they have also been focused on making sure commercially again, they are getting the right value for that product. And remember, that marketplace is largely sold out. So that certainly helps us. So then coming back as we will here over the next year, with the Midlothian FM 7 project and adding much-needed tonnage to that on top of reliability on top of utilization should put that business in an even more enviable position. And part of what I think we can be so proud of as a team has been the evolution of what that cement businesses look like in North Texas since the 2014, 2015 time frame. It’s consistently gotten better, and we think it can continue to do just that, Garik.
Garik Shmois: Makes sense. Thanks. 
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. The implied guidance in aggregates in the second half of the year, is there any way to tease out what infrastructure is going to be that. I’m really looking for the influence of the infrastructure law, what role it’s playing in the second half of the year?
Ward Nye: Yes. Thank you for the call, Keith. So, as we just think through the way that we think that’s going to look, we think infrastructure for the year is likely to be up mid-single digits. And previously, we had been at mid-single to high-single. So again, we continue to see this roll out. We think, particularly as we get towards the 3 and 4, and remember, we said we thought this would be a back half loaded from an infrastructure perspective. We see that continuing to play the same way. Again, when we came out early in the year, we said we thought single-family would be down low-double digits, I think that’s exactly what we are going to see, so no big surprise there. Again, if we look at non-res for the quarter that just ended, we had a basic breakdown of 55% heavy, 45% light. And what we actually think we are going to see is that heavy piece of it is actually going to get heavier. So, as we watch that rollout and we see some of these large manufacturing jobs come in, again, we think that’s likely to be overall for the year, probably down mid-single digits. So, we do think looking at the end users, infrastructure is the one that’s really starting to move at this point. And we think the primary volume play is that switches that we talked about a minute ago, and that is where we are with housing found, we believe, having found bottom, but shipments not yet having caught up with that. So, Keith, I hope that helps you think about the end users and at least the way we are looking at it on a percentage basis.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Phil Ng: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Cement results were really good guys. Were there any one-time drivers maybe timing of maintenance that led to that upside, or can we just kind of take that run rate in the first half and build off of that? And then Jim, you talked about how you are unlocking potentially some storage capacity and the ramp-up on PLC. Will that be bigger contributors on the volume side in the back half of this year, or you already started seeing it this year already?
Jim Nickolas: No. It’s – well, to answer your first question, there is not really any one-time good guy in this quarter for cement. So, that’s why when I answered the question earlier, I think it’s enduring. Again, there is no anomalous things happening this quarter. So, we can expect these margins to repeat. As it relates to the cement storage capacity, that helps us throughout the year that we will going forward, it’s in our guidance. And then the, of course, finish mill seven to when it comes online next year, that will be another boost to our capacity and our volumes. But our guidance number includes those volumes at this point for this year.
Ward Nye: Just one quick note to that. As we said, the transition to PLC or Type 1 does give us modestly more volume this year as compared to last. But it’s not a huge mover. We are talking, again, mid-single digits on a percentage basis.
Phil Ng: Got it. And then sorry to sneak one more in. Implicit in your guidance, Jim, are you baking in midyear price increases for cement and agg in the numbers along with what are you assuming on your assumptions on energy? I think previously, you were talking about diesel being kind of flattish in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about it at this point in your guidance?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. The first part of the answer to your question is yes, midyears are in for both agg and cement in the guidance. On energy, it’s, we use, again, really late Q2 energy levels and assume that continues for the rest of the year. So, that’s sort of the foundation for the guidance. Now of course, oil prices have come up a bit since then, but we don’t know if that’s going to stick or not, but that’s how we think about it. I would say, in total, this guidance versus prior guidance, energy is a bit of a larger tailwind than we thought. Non-energy costs were a bit of a larger headwind than we thought they kind of net out, leaving us with, the upside is largely price driven, and some of that’s taken back with lower volumes. That’s how I would think about it in the broad buckets, Phil.
Phil Ng: Okay. Really helpful. Appreciate it.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Timna Tanners: Yes. Good morning and thanks for the detail. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on Slide 11. Two questions on these categories. One is if you could talk to us about the aggregates intensity of them, in particular, trying to focus on warehouses since that’s been such a big delta with some of the starts data coming through a lot lower. And then trying to also get color on each of these categories on what you are seeing in your order books or your backlogs, particularly in some of these big categories? Thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Timna, thank you so much for that. So, I guess I would say several things. One, if we are looking at domestic manufacturing and energy and data centers. So, those are items one, two and three on Slide 11. What I would say is, number one, we capture all of those as heavy non-res. So, again, in today’s world, probably 55% of our non-res book of business. Number two, if we compare that to what maybe like commercial, retail and hospitality would look like, I have to tell you, it’s probably 7x to 9x more intensive than a single-standing big-box store maybe. So, if you are looking at the overall square footage, number one, and you are looking at the nature of the construction, number two, meaning what do the roads look like going in, they are almost all concrete. What did the walls look like, they are almost all concrete. What did the floors look like, they are concrete. And then if we throw a bone to our Magnesia Specialties business, oftentimes, the roofing is TPO. So, these large domestic manufacturing and data centers are almost Martin Marietta envelope. So obviously, energy does not because it’s typically open. But if we also think about what’s going on with those very large energy projects along the Gulf Coast of the United States, Again, the notices to proceed are coming on those – the tonnage that’s required on those is very significant tonnage, and we are starting to see movement in lending of those contracts. So again, if we look at 11 and we look at the outlook for those top three that shows full green. And we look at the outlook for the lighter piece of it that’s showing yellow. It doesn’t mean that those that are in yellow were not going forward, they are. It just doesn’t have the same rate and pace. But what we have at the top of the page tends to be some of the more aggregates-intensive. And again, from a percentage perspective, I would say oftentimes 7x to 9x more aggregate intensive than other light non-res activity.
Timna Tanners: Okay. That’s helpful. So, just to be clear then on the warehouses, in particular, we heard that was a huge contributor in the past several years to demand and now seeing those starts come down in the most recent data as much as over 50%. So, I am just wondering if you have seen kind of the big swing there. It doesn’t look like it from the yellow color, but I just wanted a little more information.
Ward Nye: No, I appreciate it. And in the prepared remarks, like we said that we haven’t seen even on the light side of it, that big a change yet. And we are watching it and we are sensitive to what could happen because of the way interest rates are moving because that tends to be something pay that’s more interest rate-sensitive. Obviously, some of that was driving simply because of COVID, the way that people are shopping and the way some of that work. Obviously, Amazon was very clear that they said they were pulling back on some of that. The fact is there were others who frankly had some catch-up that they needed to do. And I think one reason we haven’t felt as acutely as others, Timna, is how intentional we have been in building on corridors. So, if you look at the Martin Marietta footprint, you are going to see I-5 as a major corridor. You can see I-25 and the Rockies is a major corridor. You are going to see I-35 through the middle of Texas is a major corridor, not to mention 85 and 95 on the East. And then another component of it that I think is important, we are the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So, we will ship almost 2x what our closest competitor will by rail. The reason I mentioned that is distribution up and down rail networks, we think is going to be pretty notable as well. So, when we go through those and you see yellow in areas that you otherwise might think based on commentary, it might be trending towards red. I think a lot of that’s driven by the where and the how that we are moving our stone.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Tyler Brown: Hey, good morning.
Ward Nye: Hi Tyler.
Tyler Brown: Jim, first in aggregate, so I think you answered my question on baseline diesel. But what is the expected non-fuel unit cost inflation expected to be for this fiscal year that’s based in the guide because it feels very high? And then secondly, Ward, just given that supply chain issues have eased, it feels like the OEs seem to be improving deliveries, whether it’s yellow iron or trucks, and we have seen some par price disinflation. But basically, my question is, is there any building optimism that repairs and supplies could be a good story into ‘24 on the cost side, or am I maybe a little bit out of my skis on that? Thanks and sorry, for the double question.
Jim Nickolas: Sure. So, I would say that on the non-energy inflation front, high-single digits is what we are looking at for the rest of the year. I do expect that to taper a bit as we go into the year, into next year, and I would expect it to be lower next year, more closer to normal. But – and so from that perspective, there may be a tailwind. But the repairs expense that we are incurring this year, I wouldn’t view it as just for the quarter that is going to cause much of a comparison good or bad for next year, if that was the – if that was the answer to your question.
Ward Nye: And I think, Tyler, going back to your other question on supply chain and how that’s working. Look, we are seeing contract services up almost 10%. As Jim indicated, supply is up closer to 15%. So, do I think we could see some degree of moderation in that as we go into ‘24, the short answer is yes, I think we probably will. Has it been at what we feel like are unnaturally elevated levels over the last 18 months to 24 months, again I think the answer is yes. I think part of what our business has shown is a high degree of agility when we are faced with those to be able to come back and address them from a commercial perspective. So, I think we will continue to be able to do that. But I think to your point on are supply chains getting better, yes. Are we likely to see some easing in that dimension, probably so. Obviously, we will give you more detail on that as we come into ‘24, but at least those are some topside thoughts.
Tyler Brown: Yes. No, that’s good stuff. Thank you.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Good morning Ward, Jim and Jennifer.
Ward Nye: Hi Michael.
Michael Dudas: Ward, you and Jim talked in your prepared remarks, you have done a really good job of getting the leverage down and where your net debt ratios are today. And you have highlighted about portfolio optimization. So, where do you stand today relative to the optimization and looking at the pipeline for acquisitions? Is that something that might be a bit more pull forward as you look at some of the opportunities at the market that you need to serve, given you should be a pretty reasonable recovery in volumes and business as we move into ‘24 and beyond?
Ward Nye: But the short answer is I agree with you. Number one, kudos to Jim, the finance group and our operating team to find ourselves to a 2.1x leverage ratio. I mean that’s nice de-levering after what had been some of the largest M&A that the company has ever done. To your point on future growth, part of what’s attractive now about having a coast-to-coast business in markets that have been carefully curated by us and where we want to be is two things happen now. One, our aperture relative to bolt-on transactions has been opened considerably. And of course, bolt-on transactions, if you think about a return on investment, being able to get very quick synergies, that’s really the best type of transaction you can do. But here is the glory of it. Almost any transaction we would do now is going to be a bolt-on, whether it’s a single site or whether it’s multiple sites. So, I think where we positioned ourselves tactically and strategically for future growth it’s actually very important. I will tell you, we are engaged in a number of what we feel like are very meaningful conversations today, separate and distinct from the dialogue that’s ongoing relative to our discontinued operations that I mentioned before. And the dialogues in which we are engaged are primarily, if not almost exclusively on the aggregate side. So, should you expect us to continue growing our aggregates footprint, absolutely. Will we ever surprise you, I think not, because we have largely said where we want to grow and why we want to grow there. So, do we have an appetite for it, we do. And one reason we have an appetite for it, and I mean this is a complement to our team. They are good at it. They are good at identifying businesses. They are good at the contracting phase of it. And they are good at the integration phases of it as well. So, I hope to be able to tell you at some point in the year, some good stories that we can talk about specifically in the M&A. And by that, I mean the buy side and on the sell side.
Michael Dudas: Excellent. Ward, thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Gainey of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.
Kevin Gainey: Good morning everyone. It’s Kevin on for Adam.
Ward Nye: Okay.
Kevin Gainey: So, I wanted to maybe touch on ready-mix. It looks like it’s probably the best margin since maybe 2016, I don’t want to make too much of one quarter, but as far as that business, is there any structurally improvement there that maybe change things after a number of challenging years?
Ward Nye: Yes, I would say several things. One, the pricing worked well in ready-mix, number one. Number two, the ready-mix business that we have is largely a Texas ready-mix business and an Arizona ready-mix business. So number one, they tend to be warm weather states. Number two, keep in mind, particularly in Texas, we are selling aggregates to that business. We are selling cement to that business. So, about 30% of our cement is going to find its way to our own ready-mix business. We are selling degrees of our own cement in Arizona though not the same degree. So, if we look at what the drivers were, I mean you saw shipments were relatively flat. ASP was up 21%. And part of what we are seeing, and this is not a surprise, is strength in infrastructure and non-res really served to offset what had been degrees of residential softness, particularly around San Antonio and Texas. So again, you saw a very nice rise in gross profit. You saw gross margin increased 660 basis points. So again, what you are seeing is that business get back to a point that’s largely consistent with the way that we told you we thought that business would work. We told you we thought the margins would be in that low to mid-teens. So, part of what we have done over time, again, I am going to use the word I used before, we have curated the business. And we really have ready-mix there for our overall enterprise. It makes the single most sense, Kevin. So, I hope that gives you an answer to your question.
Kevin Gainey: Yes. Perfect. Thank you, Ward.
Ward Nye: Kevin, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
David MacGregor: Yes. Just thanks for taking my follow-up question. There has been a few questions here about cement margins. I am just wondering to what extent are the cement margins benefiting from Martin’s kind of unique position as a large-scale supplier of both cement and aggregates to large Texas projects and your ability to just extract maybe a synergistic margin like winning on both materials?
Ward Nye: First of all, you sly devil coming back for a second question here, David. No, look, I think your question is a really good one. I think you are right. And I think it goes back to our view of such strategic cement. Strategic cement is in a marketplace where we are the leading aggregates player. Strategic cement is where we have a notable downstream business. Strategic cement is where the market is overall built that way. And it’s not close to water. That’s exactly what Dallas-Fort Worth is. That’s exactly what San Antonio is. So, when we go back to the way that we defined strategic cement almost 9 years ago, and what we thought we could do with the business with those attributes. The cement business is benefiting from that. And clearly, we have got a very healthy concrete business. In North Texas and Central Texas that has benefited from some large projects, for example, in South Texas, what we did with Testa [ph], what we are doing in North Texas right now on any number of large projects. So, I think they have been any number of issues, David, that have come together nicely, but I am going to add, it hasn’t been by accident or happens. This has been a business that we have very carefully built and turned into something that’s a very powerful aspect of who we are. It’s not our aim to be a nationwide global cement player or otherwise. But an aggregates-led business with strategic cement that fits the definition that we have is what we have in Texas, and you can see what the financial results are. So, I hope that helps.
David MacGregor: Thanks very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, David.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Michelle, thanks so much for your hosting this today, and thank you all for joining today’s earnings conference call. Martin Marietta’s track record of success proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence and are confident in Martin Marietta’s prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhanced shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2023 results with you in the fall. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.
Jennifer Park: Thank you. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call.

[Operator Instructions].  I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that this year is off to a very strong start for Martin Marietta with first quarter records by nearly every measure. Given our focus on operating safely and responsibly, we're especially pleased that total and lost time incident rates were down 21% and 50%, respectively, in the first quarter. The exceptional quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus on commercial and operational excellence and the resiliency of our differentiated business model that separates us from others in our industry. We continue to adhere to a value-over-volume approach, focusing on an aggregates-led product strategy and carefully expanding and honing our service footprint, which today is national in scope. In brief, the results we've reported over the recent past, including the first quarter results announced today, are a tribute to our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and gives us confidence that we will deliver 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, consistent with the high end of our previously announced guidance range. As is common practice, we will revisit our guidance more formally at [indiscernible] year. As for the first quarter, our product demand remained robust. We experienced a modest decline in aggregate shipments as historically wet weather in California was partially offset by a mild winter in the Southeast. However, aggregates pricing momentum continued to build with a 12.8% sequential increase driven by the carryover effects of our 2022 inflation management actions and by broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 increases, which were pulled forward from April 1 in the vast majority of our markets. These combined shipments and pricing results demonstrate the relative price and elasticity of aggregate demand where customer service and availability of quality in materials tend to be of greater importance than product cost. Our intentional approach to capacity expansion investments at key facilities across our footprint has positioned us well to better serve our customers during this period of high product demand across many of our locations, including markets in the Southeast and Texas. Now let's turn to our financial results. We established a number of first quarter records for Martin Marietta, including consolidated total revenues of $1.35 billion, a 10% increase; consolidated gross profit of $303 million, a 94% increase; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.16, a 454% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $324 million, a 64% increase; and $5.70 aggregates gross profit per ton, a 134% increase. These results demonstrate the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, which was paramount to offsetting continued albeit moderating inflationary pressures. That said, the April OPEC+ production cuts were broadly unexpected and are likely to put upward pressure on fuel expenses throughout the remainder of the year, which tends to flow through to other cost categories. As such, our teams are actively advising customers of midyear price increases, which we anticipate will be more widely accepted and larger in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer term, Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly favorable and extended pricing cycle. Let's now turn to our first quarter operating performance beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments decreasing only 300,000 tons despite an approx but 1 million-ton shipment decline in weather-impacted California. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 22.6% or 19.6% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions particularly in the Dallas/Fort Worth [indiscernible]. Yet largely due to wet and cold weather to start the year, first quarter shipments declined 6.8%. Importantly, we delivered pricing growth of 32.2% more than offsetting the effect of lower weather-impacted shipments. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and accordingly, have announced a $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments decreased 37.1% and pricing increased 20.2%. As a reminder, our first quarter 2023 ready mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested nearly 13 months ago on April 1, 2022, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. Asphalt shipments decreased 25.1%, driven primarily by wet weather in California and Arizona. Pricing improved 9.9% following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our first quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted first quarter revenues of $1.27 billion, a 10.1% increase over last year's comparable period and a first quarter gross profit record of $276 million, a 99.4% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 131.7% relative to the prior year, resulting in a first quarter record of $238 million. Aggregate gross margin improved 1,250 basis points to 26.1% as strong pricing growth more than offset modestly lower shipments and continued inflationary pressure impacting most cost categories. Aggregates gross margin also benefited from geographic shipment mix, which reflected a larger contribution from the higher-margin Southeast markets. Geographic mix is expected to normalize over the balance of the year. Our Texas cement business delivered record first quarter top and bottom line results, continuing its recent track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.9% to $169 million, while gross profit increased 75.4% to $47 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial strategy drove gross margin expansion of 860 basis points to 28% as pricing gains and normalization of natural gas expenses more than offset lower operating leverage and higher raw materials and maintenance costs. As we shared previously, our Midlothian, Texas plant has several initiatives underway to increase production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill that we expect to complete in the third quarter of 2024. The new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today's nearly sold out marketplace. At both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants, the process of converting our construction cement customers from type 1, type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as type 1L, is substantially complete. We expect those efforts to provide additional capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022. Our ready mixed concrete revenue declined 24.4% to $220 million and gross profit declined 48.9% to $11 million driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations last April, impacting prior year comparability. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 2.1% to $58 million as increased pricing offset weather-impacted shipments in California and Arizona. Consistent with its typical seasonality, this business posted a $20.5 million gross loss as the Minnesota operations are inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. Ideally, most asphalt installations occur when both ground and air temperatures are between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Magnesia Specialties generated record first quarter revenues of $83 million an 8.4% increase. Despite top line growth, gross profit declined 2.7% to $25 million due to higher supplies and contract services expenses, resulting in a 330 basis point decline and gross margin to 30%. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, which emphasizes responsible growth through acquisitions, reinvestment in our business operations and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $117 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 204,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $368 per share in the first quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.4x, within our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. We like Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we begin this year with great promise. We continue to experience healthy customer backlogs and are encouraged by a number of factors that support near, medium and long-term demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated. We'll start with infrastructure, which accounted for 32% of first quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government highway bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is meaningfully higher year-over-year with growth of 16% to a record $104 billion for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2023. Importantly, state Departments of Transportation, or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states are well positioned from a readiness and resource perspective to utilize the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. Also late last year, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package, which included the Cornyn - Padilla Amendment, allowing states and local municipalities to allocate unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. This amendment alone is estimated to provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding to Martin Marietta's top 10 states. We expect this step change in public sector investment stemming from a number of historic legislative actions to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important, often countercyclical end market. Moving now to nonresidential construction, this quarter's largest end-use representing 38% of our aggregate shipments. Heavy industrial projects led by energy, onshore manufacturing and data centers continue to drive demand in the segment accounting for the majority of total nonresidential shipments. The large project pipeline remains robust. As an example, estimated aggregates requirements for key Gulf Coast petrochemical projects have increased by over 33% since our last earnings report. The aggregates intensity of these Gulf Coast projects is immense. And importantly, we have the production capacity and the long-haul logistics capabilities to supply specification products to these significant projects in a timely manner. In addition to large petrochemical facilities, electric vehicle and related battery plants, semiconductor and other critical product domestic manufacturing projects will be supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and Ships Act, resulting in an extended cycle with the aggregate-intensive, heavy nonresidential sector. With respect to the light nonresidential end market, we've yet to experience any notable weakness in this segment as shipments due in-process projects continue. With that said, new projects may have more difficulty accessing capital if commercial lending conditions meaningfully tighten. As such, we expect a slowdown in product shipments to the light nonresidential sector later this year. Residential shipments accounted for 25% of total aggregate shipments this quarter, reflecting a modest 2.6% decline from the prior year as resilient multifamily construction, partially offset the single-family affordability air pocket. Importantly, recent public homebuilder sentiment has been notably upbeat with respect to single-family housing, and we have observed recent positive data indicative of a near-term bottoming in certain of our [indiscernible] markets. Longer term, the structural housing deficit resulting from a decade of underbuilding is expected to drive a base level of demand for single-family homes across key Martin Marietta geographies for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting first quarter performance provides excellent momentum going into the balance of the year. As a result, we're confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our previously announced 2023 financial guidance range and navigate the current macroeconomic backdrop. Taking a broader view, we believe that our financial results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model as we continue along our path of building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Guys, amazing quarter. Was there anything -- maybe it's a question for Jim, but was there anything that specifically helped Q1 aggregates margins? And how are you thinking about aggregates margins as we move into the middle of the year?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. The main answer to the question is ASP growth. That carried a lot of the weight, and it was just obviously a phenomenal performance this year. So that really is the answer. And of course, that's going to carry through into the subsequent quarters as well. That sticks, as you know. So no real changes or unusual items on the cost side but ASO did the [indiscernible] work. Plus, as you know, we advanced pricing increases from April 1 into January 1 successfully this year, and that had a big impact as well.
Ward Nye: Adam, one thing I'll add to that too to keep in mind, what we've said on pricing so far this year does not take into account the midyears that we think we're going to have in place this year. You heard me speak to them in the prepared remarks, we think we see more mid-years. And we think we see higher midyears coming in this year than we thought we saw even in February. And so I think there are a couple of different components as we think about the margins going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Thompson: And I appreciate the color that you gave previously on pricing. And tagging into that and just a bigger picture question. When we look at -- for big trends that are impacting the U.S. reshoring, near shoring, population shift, increasing environmental focus and then government support through IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. When you look at those 4 factors, how does Martin Marietta win in this? And what does that mean for pricing realistically in the mid- to long term?
Ward Nye: Kathryn, thanks for your question. To your question, as we think about pricing and we think about markets, I think several things. One, Kathryn, what you said I agree with. I sum up much of what you said in these words, so I think we're looking at what can be a manufacturing renaissance in the United States. The fact is we as a nation has to get back to building things. And what we're going to see is a nice combination of public spending relative to infrastructure or I should say, investment. We're going to see a lot more manufacturing in the United States, whether it's CHIPS or otherwise. And we're already seeing a nice burgeoning growth in energy. So let's take those 3 things and then step back away from it and think about the where. And I think that's where Martin Marietta is going to be uniquely positioned to win, as you said, going through this because as we think about the position that we've built in the Eastern United States along the I-5, I-95, I-40 corridor, where we are in the central U.S. along the I-35 corridor in Texas, which remember that corridor in Texas all by itself has more people than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If you look at the slowest -- I mean, excuse me, the smallest mega region, but fastest growing up and down the I-25 corridor in Colorado, again, we have a very attractive position up and down I-25 where a lot of people are coming in. And now we have to position up and down the I-4 corridor in California as well. So I do think the commercial aspect of what we're doing now and the commercial aspect of what we're doing going forward will be very attractive. But I think the way that we have very intentionally built out this business in mega regions in the United States trading out of areas that were slower growth into areas that are faster growth and will be that way for the long term is going to make the difference. Similarly, keep in mind, we positioned ourselves in states that are in very good shape from a DOT perspective, and we think that matters a lot. So if we're looking at public spend, which we think it's likely to be the single biggest driver of our business over the next several years, keep in mind, 1/3 of the $110 billion in the IIJA that are going to roads and bridges, a full 1/3 of that is going to our top 10 states. So we talk about housing a lot of times just generally, and it's all about location. I would tell you this business, too, is about location. And that location will drive volumes and that location will also drive the pricing. So Kathryn, I hope that gives you a good snapshot of how we look at it.
Operator: The next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: So first, just as a point of clarity, you mentioned, Ward, that your guidance doesn't include maybe your increases, I know for sure, in aggregates. But is that also the case for the $10 cement price increase that you just talked about?
Ward Nye: Yes, Trey, it is. So again, we've communicated with our customers in April that we're looking for a $10 a ton increase at half year. And again, that is not yet included in our guidance, which we're saying we're going to revisit more formally at half year.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Ward, I wanted to ask about your Tehachapi cement plant since the FTC recently put that deal to the sidelines. And just would love to get some color from you on maybe your expectations for that asset going forward.
Ward Nye: Happy to respond to that. Thank you, Trey. Yes, it was interesting when the termination of that transaction with CalPortland was announced, we actually had a good bit of incoming, and that was not a surprise to us. So we've heard from a number of parties expressing interest in that asset as you saw from our release today. We've also transacted and sold the import cement business in California at Stockton. So again, consistent with our view of what is strategic cement, strategic cement for us is that wonderful cement business that you've heard about in Texas. We will continue to move forward with the process relative to Tehachapi. We feel confident that we will get very attractive value for that. And we feel confident we will transact on that this year. So that's the way we're looking at that right now, Trey.
Operator: The next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.
Stanley Elliott: Congratulations on the strong start to the year. I guess, kind of sticking on the Texas cement market, it's certainly been a differentiator for you all. Maybe can you speak to some of the confidence or some of the conversations you're having around the second increase with pricing up, what, like 30% year-over-year? And then also kind of the health of the market and the ability to absorb the additional production on the PLC side. And then finally, maybe expectations around cost there?
Ward Nye: Stanley, thank you so much for the question. So if we really think about what we're looking at from a volume perspective in that state, it's probably going to be around 4.2 million tons this year. Keep in mind, the need for cement in Texas is far greater than the ability to produce it domestically is in Texas today. So number one, you start with that market fundamental, and that's a very attractive place to be. As you know, the largest portion of our cement business is in North Texas. It's led by our Midlothian plant. So as we indicated for the quarter, volumes were down 6.8% overall, largely due to weather. But if we're looking at North Texas, they were down about 1.6%. So again, biggest single piece of our business in Texas remains very robust. Relative to the pricing conversations that we're having with customers, they're aware of where we're going. They're aware of the cost inputs that we continue to see in portions of our business, particularly relative to supplies, materials, those types of things. So as we're sitting here today, again, we've recognized the vast majority of the price increase that we put in place relative to January 1. We're anticipating success on the one that we're looking at on July 1 as well. And we think the overall position of the Texas market -- and keeping in mind a lot of the infrastructure in that state is concrete, most of the roads in Texas are concrete roads and about half of our cement finds its way to infrastructure. So I think when you take the way that state is literally built and where our positions are in Central and North Texas: number one, we feel confident in the durability of the business; and number two, we feel confident in what we're going to be able to do [ happier ] relative to pricing.
Operator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: I wanted to ask, aggregates gross margins on a like-for-like basis, you were essentially flat sequentially versus normal seasonality that where you'd be normally down 12 points. And I'm just wondering, as we consider building off of this margin run rate into 2Q, applying normal seasonality would suggest moderate gross margins in the low to mid-40s, that's excluding delivery revenues in the second quarter. So I just want to make sure we don't get up over our skis and run rating the performance here. Anything we should keep in mind relative to that normal seasonality that just mathematically suggest excluding delivery revenues you'd be in aggregates gross margins in the low to mid-40s in 2Q?
Ward Nye: Jerry, thank you for the questions. So yes, let's be careful with the skis. So the short answer is we're going to see a very nice continued build in margins this year. But the normal build that you would see going from 1 to 2, that would be much larger than it is in most quarters. You won't see that same quantum leap this year. In large measure because as you pointed out, Q1 was so attractive. So do we intend to see and expect to see margin expansion going into Q2 and for the balance of the year. The answer is we do. But I would seriously urge you, don't go leaning into that same degree of percentages that you would have seen in years past. And keep in mind, Jerry, in many respects, we're seeing an EBITDA in Q1 that would have looked like our EBITDA for a full year in 2010. So again, we've built the business very intentionally to be more durable through cycles and through quarters. But given this outstanding performance in Q1, I expect really attractive performance this year. But yes, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves on those percentages. Jim, anything you want to add to that in particular?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. No. Just Jerry, as you think about sort of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, our 3- or 5-year average would show a bigger bump in the line spike in Q2 and Q3. I think for 2023, you should view a higher Q1 and a lower Q2 and Q3 vis-a-vis percent of total profits for the year. So 100% of the profits over the 4 quarters, more in Q1 this year than is typical. But take a little bit out of Q2 and Q3 as a percent of total.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Anthony. If I think about some of the possible drivers of what seems like better than expected realization on your January hike, I think of it maybe like some combination of stronger backlog of demand, maybe some higher anticipated inflation in the industry or maybe some customer rationalization. So in terms of the pricing we saw in 1Q, what would you point to as maybe a bigger driver or maybe a combination of drivers? And then highlight any differences there may be between aggregates and cement?
Ward Nye: Thank you for the question. I think there are a number of different drivers. I think, number one, clearly, inflation just moved very rapidly last year. And what we've proven in this business through cycle after cycle is this is a very durable business. If inflation spikes, very, very quickly, we cannot keep up with the mediacy, but we will catch up with it. We will tend to pass it. And I think that's what you saw. So I think you saw a cumulative action of several different builds from price increases last year, number one; number two, we were very purposeful in moving a number of price increases from April 1 to January 1. That was impactful as well. Keep in mind, the one thing that we've called out that I do think is really important is we have not built midyears into what we're looking at right now, although we do believe midyears are coming. So I think those are the primary drivers. I think, secondarily, is really where we've moved our business over time. So if we're looking at a very strong business in portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, a very strong business in Texas and an emerging business in California, I think all of those help us as we think about the commercial aspects of what we're doing and the fact that aggregates into relatively small percentage of the overall cost of construction. And I think those factors coalesce together to put us in a position that we can expand margins in a business where you have a depleting natural resource. And what we recognize is the stone in the ground is worth more tomorrow than it is today and mindful of how difficult that can be to replace. We want to make sure we're getting fair value for those products today.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.
Michael Feniger: Ward, you talked about how pricing lagged inflation last year in the beginning. Now your pricing is well ahead of inflation. Just -- how do we think about that spread of price versus cost inflation into 2024? Can that spread be outsized in '24 as you edge the year with double-digit price increases, the mid-year price increases come through and we start to see cost inflation start to roll over such as oil and diesel?
Ward Nye: Michael, thank you for the question. Number one, if we're looking at overall cost inflation today, it's probably running, let's call it, 7%. So that's not a bad way to think of it. If we're looking at some of the big movers last year, obviously, energy was a really big mover last year, not as much on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So if we're looking at energy up, let's call it, high single digits -- supplies and repairs are the ones that were actually up in -- supplies low teens, repairs low 20s on a percentage basis. At the same time, if we look at what we're doing relative to pricing, we think at this point, we are likely to stay ahead of that. We think we are likely to see margin expansion. And it's certainly our aim to see that throughout '23 and into '24. Again, back to the notion that we're relatively small cost of the overall construction, and we have a product that, by its very nature, is depleting. And despite the fact that because of good planning, we have very long-lived reserves in our operations today. And I think that's important to call out. But nonetheless, I don't think prudent planning on our part should serve as something that would be a detriment on us utilizing our positions to make sure we're getting expanded margins through the cycle for the rest of this year and into next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.
Timna Tanners: I have 2 high-level questions, if I could sneak them in. One is just given the nice beat in the first quarter EBITDA and the repeated confidence in mid-quarter midyear price hikes, why just steer to the high end of guidance? Is there something that's keeping you from changing the range? And then similarly on -- when you think about cash use, really nice share buybacks. Does that have any commentary on the M&A opportunities that you're seeing or is it just a combination of ways to use cash?
Ward Nye: Thank you for that. Relative to guidance, we just feel like January, February and March is really early to change guidance. Obviously, you can tell from my tone, you can tell from our prepared remarks that we have a lot of confidence in the year. Obviously, as we've said, it doesn't take into account mid-years. So our view is let's come back at half year, let's revisit guidance. Then we can do it, I think, with much more precision then. So our view is we'll just come back and do it then. Relative to the buybacks, I guess several things. Number one, we obviously had some degrees of dilution just through compensation. We like to address that on an annual basis. Clearly, we've gone in more deeply than that. In many respects, Timna, frankly, because we thought buying Martin Marietta made a lot of sense to us, given where the share price was. So from the perspective of just general uses of cash, that made sense to us. It is not a reflection, let me be clear, on how we're looking at the M&A marketplace right now because what I can assure you is actually the dialogue that we have ongoing and the pipeline actually looks as good as I've ever seen it look. And I think there's some potential transactions that we can discuss later in the year that will largely be pure aggregates in nature, that will be attractive and that will be important. So one of the nice circumstances that we have is this business is cash generative of that we can look at multiple ways to return cash to shareholders and increase value. Share buybacks being one of them, a solid dividend that continues to go up is another way to do it and then [ NCDOT ] accretive acquisitions is a third. So that's how I would answer your questions very directly, Timna.
Operator: The next question comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: This is really turning. I guess just if I could just build up to Timna's questions for a second, and then I had a principal question. But what is your capital allocation is the longer term because clearly, we're heading into a period, this isn't just 2023. You're heading into a multiyear period of expanding free cash flow. And so the question from a capital allocation standpoint is, is the principal use of that cash at this point to grow by acquisition? Or is there an opportunity to go in, extend your reserve life and expand organically? And just more of a longer-term view on how you put all of these returns to work. And then if I just give you my question now, I really want to just parse out the ASP growth. Obviously, an awfully strong performance, but how much of this is related to just volume growth in the East versus volume declines in the West this quarter? And as you talked about the timing of implementing pricing in January 1 this year versus April 1 last year, it would be great just if you could bridge those points to the reported number. It would be a big help.
Ward Nye: Happy to do what I can, David. Thank you very much. Let's talk first about capital allocation. As we think about capital allocation, to your point, we've not changed our priorities. So our best use of capital is doing the right transaction in the right place. One of the things that we find so remarkable about this business, as we've gone out look in geographies where we would have an interest and looked in areas in which we believe we could also buy businesses, here's what I'll tell you, we found there were what we think are 200 million tons a year of businesses on a per annum basis that we could acquire. So think of it in these terms, David, that's another Martin Marietta that's out there. So if we're looking at modestly over 210 million tons of production or sales last year, there are businesses out there that are modestly bigger than that, that we think would be attractive to us in the geographies that we said we want to grow, number one; number two, if we think about the quarter that you just saw, and again, you're looking at something the same way that I do. And that is, we think we're entering a series of years here that will be very attractive, here's the way I would encourage you to think about the volume. I'm just going to talk a little bit about what was weather affected in the first quarter. And as we look at weather effects in the first quarter, what I would tell you is, overall, if we're looking in the East, where actually the weather was relatively normal and dry, volumes there were up about 570,000 tons. If we look in the Southwest, again, our largest market by revenue, profitability and otherwise, actually, they had almost 2x the rain that we saw in the prior year quarter. Similarly, if we look at Central -- and keep in mind, Central is never going to be a big contributor in Q1 with the possible exception of agg line because people tend to put that on their fields in the winter, they can do if it's cold, they can't do if it's wet, and Central had the wettest Q1 since 2010. And then the West had record rains. So East was up about 570,000. California was down almost 1 million tons, as I said in my prepared remarks. And the Southwest was down about 320,000. So was there -- were there degrees of movement there? Absolutely. Did it really swing the quarter dramatically? Not so much. But I think that does give you a sense of what was happening underlying weather and otherwise in the quarter. So I hope that helps you build that bridge.
Operator: The next question comes from Rohit Seth with Seaport Research.
Rohit Seth: Volumes seem to be holding up better than expected. Can you discuss your expectations for volumes by market? And maybe comment on what you're seeing today with shipments to the highway projects and what you're seeing with the ramp-up?
Ward Nye: I won't go so much into what we're seeing right now on volume in specific markets because we'll talk more about that in the quarter to come, but here's what I would say. If I go through and really think about our leading states -- and I'll do it this way. If I talk about infrastructure first, TxDOT learnings are expected to exceed $11.2 billion this year. I mean that's an enormous amount. And if we're looking even into next year, it's $11.7 billion. If we're looking in Colorado, which is an important state for us, the recently passed $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill we think is going to have great tailwinds to it. Here in North Carolina, part of what we've seeing here, one, North Carolina has shifted sales tax revenue to the highway fund. So that's going to be an additional 2% this year, 4% in '24, 6% in '25. And in large measure, we're seeing infrastructure increases by $7 billion in North Carolina over the next decade. Obviously, North Carolina is hugely important to us. In Georgia, despite the fact that they had suspended the gas tax proportions of last year, we're seeing $1.1 billion of surplus funds coming back into that. In Florida, record DOT spending, they've got a budget of $13 billion. Again, that's an all-time record. And in California, Governor Newsom has proposed an FY '24 [indiscernible] trends budget of $20.7 billion. That's a 5.6% year-over-year increase. So that's on the federal side. Frankly, not taking into account what can come from Cornyn-Padilla and other things. If we're looking at nonres, and that's something that I think is just so important right now because as we look at those different markets in which we participate right now, Samsung and Texas, the Texas Instruments facility. Golden Pass, CPChem are all big projects. Equally, if we go to Colorado, High Point Logistics park near Aurora is something that's important. But in North Carolina, what we're seeing is Wolfspeed, Microsoft, Toyota, just a host of large industrial projects as well as port development in Georgia. We're seeing Rivian coming into social circle. We're seeing the Hyundai plant in Savannah. So I think to your point, Rohit, if we're looking across volume, and saying, public, we believe, is growing into the second half. We think the second half is where that's really going to show off. We think nonres, as you heard in my commentary, 38% of our shipments, the heavy side of that is good. It looks like it's going to stay good. What we're seeing on those petrochem projects in South Texas and Louisiana is extraordinary right now. And here's the other piece of it that I think is interesting. I think for us, housing is probably at its [indiscernible] right now. As we're thinking about housing, housing started slowing down last year. We're probably seeing the effects of that now. We were still 25% of our volume. And we think in the second half of this year, multifamily is going to start to be joined by single family with more activity. So again, as we think about the way the volume build is likely to go over the next few quarters, we think that's likely to be how it is. I still think this tends to be more of a second half year story than a first half year story. But Rohit, I hope that gives you the color that you were looking at largely on a state-by-state basis.
Rohit Seth: I mean it sounds like the pipeline is pretty strong. Just on the heavy side, is there any risk from the tightened credit conditions on heavy projects being delayed?
Ward Nye: It's hard to imagine on the heavy side, that's going to be an issue. It's interesting to me. Keep in mind, about 55% of our nonres is heavy, about 45% of its light. If we're looking at what we're seeing on heavy, we're seeing energy sector volumes up pretty notably. LNG is up over 300%. Renewables were up 82%. Wind energy -- we saw 300 permits pulled in Iowa for 2024. So again, if we're looking at these types of projects that I don't think tend to be uniquely finance-driven, I think we're in a pretty good place on that. I did call it out relative to certain portions of light that we think might slow down in the second half of the year. And frankly, it's been a little bit better so far than we would have thought that probably helps bridge to a degree what you're seeing relative to the overall goodness in the volumes in Q1.
Operator: The next question comes from Adrian Huerta with JPMorgan.
Adrian Huerta: Given what we're seeing on cost inflation for aggregate volume around mid to high single digits and given what we have seen on pricing and even not including a second price increase, would you agree that gross profit per ton seems to be heading to north of $7 for this year?
Ward Nye: Yes. I'll certainly tell you gross profit per ton has a very nice track record to it. And I know if you go to the supplemental slides and you take a look at Slide 5, it gives you a good sense of what that CAGR looks like over a 3-year, 5-year and a 10-year period. And frankly, my sense is that's going to look better in the future than it's looked in the past. So look, you're seeing where it's come from FY 2013 when it was just modestly over $2 a ton to what we're looking at relative to expectations this year, north of $6. I think our ability to grow that metric is frankly, better than others. I think that's what you're likely to see from us. That's something that we're highly focused on. And look, I see where you're going with it. I'm not necessarily in a position to debate it with you. I think it's just a matter of what the time frame is going to look like, Adrian.
Operator: The next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.
Dillon Cumming: I'm sorry to fixate on pricing again. But I think, Ward, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that some of your confidence in the midyear price increase was tied to the fact that oil had inflated pretty significantly post OPEC cut. And again, unfair probably is given the volatility. But if you look at spot crude pricing, today, it's closer back to that point where it was in March. I think about freight rates, I think you're also down significantly year-over-year. When you take those 2 kind of cost items, are you still, I guess, confident in your ability to get those midyear price increases given the kind of contemplated cost deflation there? Or do you feel like it's not as much tied to what you've seen more recently?
Ward Nye: Yes. I am confident we're going to see the midyear price increases. Now let me be clear. I'm not saying we're going to get them in every market and at every place. But I think we're going to see them more widely than we thought back in February, I think they're going to be bigger than we thought in February. And I think you're right. I mean there's some components of energy that aren't moving with the same aggressiveness that we saw last year. At the same time, as I indicated before, if we're looking at our supplies up nearly 13%, if we're looking at repairs in some places up 21.5% ish, those are the types of inflation numbers that we're having to make sure that we can navigate in our business. And for us to do that, we're going to have to make sure we're getting some help on the top line as well. And again, I think Dillon, it's so important to remember, as we said before, we're a very low percentage of the overall cost of construction. We're 10% of the cost of building a road, 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on our nonres project. So as a practical matter, we think this is going to be very durable. And again, despite the fact that if we look at today's attraction rate, on average, we probably have 70 years of reserves in Martin Marietta operations. Again, good planning should not put us in a point that we're going to be -- that will be punitive to ourselves on what we'll do commercially. So again, we've got great resilience around that. We'll talk more about that and the specifics at our call after Q2.
Operator: The next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Phil Ng: Congrats on a very strong quarter. Ward, it was really helpful kind of highlighting all the great funding you have on the infrastructure side, particularly in your states. So the fundings there, there's no denying that. I guess what I wanted to get better color on is timing of projects? In the past, there could be some movement, right, in supply chain, labor stuff. How is that lining up so far in terms of your expectations and how that's progressing? And then separately, on the heavy side, you sound very bullish on that front. In the past, I would have thought it was more 50-50. I appreciate it's a little more aggregates intensive versus the light stuff. How do you see that kind of -- that mix shaping up in the coming years with all the funding you have, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the IRA Act?
Ward Nye: Sure. Thank you so much for that, Phil. So I'd say several things. Historically, what you've had about a 50-50 split between light and heavy on nonres, Historically, that is where we would have resided. You're exactly right. The last couple of years has trended more toward that 55, 45 break, and that's what we continue to see. I think it's likely to stay that way for a while in large measure. Because, frankly, Phil, the heavy projects are getting heavier. And what I mean by that is they're so aggregates-intensive. And now given the degree of manufacturing that's going to be coming with the CHIPS Act and with the IRA and otherwise, I think we're just going to see more of that, and I think that's going to drive heavy. And heavy, literally is just that, it's heavy. To your question on infrastructure, I get it. Look, I still think it's a half 2 issue. I'm still taken by the fact that when I look at our top 10 states, and I look at an overall average of their budgets up year-over-year, 11%. But then when I look at Florida up 38%, north Carolina up 11%, South Carolina up 28%, these are states that for us from an infrastructure perspective really can move the needle. And keep in mind, even the state like Iowa, is up 10%, and Iowa's state where we've got a very attractive position. So a number of these states have not had the historic spend and invest that we're going to see going forward. I do think, again, it's a second half loaded issue. I don't think logistics are the issue going into this year than they have been in years past. Rail is functioning much better. Trucking is functioning much better. Contractors have hired more over the last 18 months than they were able to previously. So we think from a labor perspective, we're in a good space. We think from a DOT and best perspective, we're in a good place. And we think, again, from a logistics perspective, we're really very advantaged today. And again, I think our ability, for example, to get into some of the petrochemical projects in South Texas, utilizing BN, UP and as well as Kansas City Southern and Ship places us in a position that's really unparalleled today in an area that is likely to see just immense work. And again, even on the public side, keep in mind, if we're looking at highway contract awards over the last 3 years, those were growing at a CAGR of around 5.2%. If we look at where they are on an LTM at the end of March, it's up 16.2%. So again, almost 3x what we've seen historically. So I think by any measure, if we look at infrastructure and we look at heavy nonres and then back to that break that you identified between them, I really am pretty enthusiastic about the way that looks from Martin Marietta right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.
Michael Dudas: Ward, just any thoughts on the performance of Magnesia Specialties? Any indications on maybe general economy you're seeing in that business? Any potential for upside this year and how the business looks moving forward given some of the -- we think some of the positive demand trends that we're seeing tangentially for the rest of your construction world.
Ward Nye: Thank you for the question on agg. So several things: one, it's a very good business; two, I think it's an important differentiator for us; three, record quarterly revenues, again, the RAMP revenues were up 8.4%. The biggest single issues we had there, we saw higher contract services. We had a little bit more kiln downtime. And frankly, steel was running a little bit lower. It's now running at about let's call it, 74% year-to-date, it's been at about 70.1%. So based on some recent history, that's a little bit lower. The other thing that's different in that business, and we're in the process of remedying that. They have longer-term contracts with customers than we would typically see in aggregate that's taken a little bit more time to move those up as we have with aggregates pricing. So the short answer is, it's always ironic when we look at [ MAG ], and we feel like they didn't have the quarter that you would like to have seen. We're still looking at margins with the 3 in front of it. And my guess is as we go through time, we will see that business start moving margins back up to something that looks a lot closer to a 4 instead. So Michael, I hope that's responsive.
Operator: The last question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.
Garik Shmois: Congrats, of course, on the quarter. I wanted to ask on non-res one more time. Just on the light non-res side, it sounds like it's holding in better than expected thus far. I'm curious if you're seeing any change though in the bidding environment? I know you've indicated that you might expect a slowdown later this year, but have there been any recent signs whether in bidding or backlog, the -- that's going to be the case.
Ward Nye: Number one, thank you for the question, Garik. Not so much really. It's really more anticipating where we think that's going to go. Maybe a very modest slowing. But again, -- those projects tend to move relatively quickly. The heavy non-res, you can see coming a long way away. You know that's coming. The light non-res, not as much. So if I told you we had good data on it. I'd be leaning in a little bit more than I should. But I think conversationally, what we're seeing in the world of banking and otherwise, it's just making us look at that with a little bit higher degree of caution. But again, overall, if we think about non-res and what's happening on the heavy side of it, it really does serve as a very powerful counterbalance.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Again, thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success through various business cycles, proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for the safest operations and remain focused on executing our strategic plan while continuing to drive sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2023 results with you in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Again, thank you for your time and continued support of Mart Marietta. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Martin Marietta's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.
Jennifer Park: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our full year and fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends and 2023 guidance.

Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation after which Ward will conclude with market trends and our 2023 outlook. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that in 2022, Martin Marietta delivered our most profitable year and our 11th consecutive year of growth for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. Martin Marietta also achieved a world class total injury incident rate for the second year in a row and a world class lost time incident rate for the sixth consecutive year. We delivered these record results along with platform M&A integration and multiple portfolio optimization actions amid a challenging macroeconomic setting that included a housing slowdown, monetary tightening and 40-year high inflation. Martin Marietta's accomplishments are a testament to our team's steadfast commitments to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Most importantly, the company is well-positioned to deliver another record year in 2023. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few takeaways from the fourth quarter. While pricing growth significantly accelerated, product shipments were adversely affected by inclement weather and a number of key Martin Marietta geographies. As a reminder, we're comparing 2022 results against the fourth quarter of 2021 when we benefited from unseasonably warm and dry weather that extended the construction season late into the year. With this context, aggregates shipments decreased 12% against the prior year quarter. Yet, as we began 2023, aggregates customers' backlogs remained healthy and shipment trends thus far are ahead of planned levels. Aggregates pricing in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased a robust 16.5%, a quarterly record or 5.6% sequentially, providing attractive tailwinds into 2023. Further, despite the weather impacts on operating leverage and acceleration of certain operating expenses, pricing growth drove aggregates gross margin expansion and improved gross profit per ton shipped by 25% over the prior year quarter. In summary, for the final quarter of 2022, poor weather was a literal headwind. The 2023 stage has been set, both operationally and commercially. Now, let's turn to our full year 2022 results and the new financial records we set for an 11th consecutive year in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated products and services revenues of $5.7 billion, a 13% increase, consolidated gross profit of $1.4 billion, a 6% increase, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a 5% increase. These results underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions in 2022. As a result, we achieved double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines. However, we were not immune to the rapid and significant inflationary pressures that impacted our operating costs and affected our product gross margin, which declined 160 basis points to 24.9% for the year. As an example, 2022s results included $178 million of energy cost headwinds, an over 55% increase compared with 2021. It bears repeating that inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for our upstream materials, the benefits of which long endure after inflationary pressures abate. We believe our multiple commercial actions enacted in 2022, coupled with broad customer support of our January 1st, 2023 price increases will drive meaningful pricing acceleration and margin expansion in 2023. Let's now turn to our full year operating performance, beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments increasing 3.3% to 208 million tons. Aggregate pricing fundamentals remain very attractive as pricing increased 10.6% or 10% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record yearly shipments of 4.2 million tons and pricing growth of 16.9%. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future based on market trends and the success of our January 1st price increases. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, prior year shipment comparability for ready mixed concrete is notably impacted by last April's divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and only partially offset by our Arizona acquisition. Cumulatively, concrete shipments decreased 25.4% and pricing increased 11.3%, reflecting multiple pricing actions in the year, including fuel surcharges in order to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost increases. Asphalt shipments increased 28.4% driven by contributions from our acquired California and Arizona operations, which also impacts the prior year comparability. Pricing improved 23.6%, following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our 2022 discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted record products and services revenues of $5.45 billion, a 13.4% increase over last year and a product gross profit record of $1.34 billion, an 8.1% increase. Aggregates product gross profit improved 8.3% relative to the prior year, achieving a record $980 million. Aggregates product gross margin declined 160 basis points to 28%, as robust pricing growth throughout the year did not serve to offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs until the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Texas cement business delivered an all-time record top and bottom line results. Product revenues increased 21.8% to $602 million, while product gross profit increased 30.1% to $204 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial approach drove product gross margin expansion of 210 basis points to 33.9% despite significant energy cost headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. 2022 was a great year for our strategic cement business. It's worth highlighting this business growth and performance over the last three years. Since 2019, shipments are up 8%, while product revenues are up 37%. Revenue has grown over 4.5 times faster than shipments, demonstrating the team's commitment to commercial excellence. Over that same timeframe, gross profit is up 42% despite energy costs doubling. And consistent operational improvements focused on reliability and efficiency have brought increased production and higher margins. This journey of growth is far from complete. As previously disclosed, our Midlothian plant has several initiatives underway to improve production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024. The other initiatives remain on-track and have already provided additional capacity. At both the Midlothian and Hunter plants, we have largely completed converting our construction cement customers from Type 1 and Type 2 cement to the less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. The cumulative efforts of our capital expenditures at Midlothian and the conversion to Type 1L resulted in growing production volumes by 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 levels. We expect those efforts to provide an additional capacity expansion of 5% in 2023. Our ready mixed concrete product revenues declined 17% to $931 million, and product gross profit declined 27.2% to $70 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and partially offset by contributions from our acquired Arizona operations impacting prior year comparability. Increased aggregates and cement costs further weighed on gross margin, which declined 100 basis points to 7.3%. Our 2022 asphalt and paving results include the acquired California and Arizona operations impacting comparability with the prior year. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $775 million, a 50.8% increase over the prior year. Product gross profit increased $3 million to $82 million, while continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to product gross margin decline of 480 basis points to 10.6%. Magnesia Specialties generated product revenues of $278 million, a 1.2% increase over the prior year. However, higher energy, supplies and contract services expenses resulted in a product gross profit decline of 13.5% of $96 million, and product gross margin compression of 580 basis points to 34.4%. Our full year energy expense was $178 million or 55% higher than the prior year and diesel fuel accounted for approximately half of that cost increase. While diesel cost increases moderated in the fourth quarter, they remained a headwind. Our 2023 guidance assumes that the cost per gallon of diesel falls only modestly from current elevated levels. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $309 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As a reminder, in August 2022, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. In October, the Federal Trade Commission issued a second request for information related to this pending transaction and we continue to work towards closing this matter in a timely manner. At December 31st, 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times after a year of robust M&A activity. In 2022, our stated focus was on integrating these new operations into our business, executing portfolio enhancing divestitures and deleveraging to within the Company's targeted range. As a result, we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by year's end. Exiting the year with a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investments in attractive upstream acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks Jim. We're finally enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we build upon the foundation established in 2022. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to support multiyear demand for our products across infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors, thereby improving the durability of our business through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Starting first with infrastructure. The value of state and local governments highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator of future demand, grew 24% to a record $102 billion in 2022. By comparison, the compounded annual growth rate for combined highway and bridge awards from 2018 through 2021, was 1.7%. State Departments of Transportation or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states remain robustly funded with budgets all above or in line with prior year levels and are well-positioned from a resource aspect and desire perspective to deploy the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. In addition to the multiyear funding from the IIJA in December 2022, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package. Included in the package is the Cornyn-Padilla amendment allowing states and local municipalities to use unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. It's estimated this alone will provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding for Martin Marietta's top 10 states. Importantly, investments in our nation's infrastructure maintains broad public support. During the November 2022 election, voters nationwide approved 87% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $23 billion of additional infrastructure funding. A few notable funding initiatives include $15 billion in Texas, $3 billion in San Francisco, $1.3 billion in South Carolina, through a sales tax addition and $1 billion in Colorado, through the renewal of a sales tax addition. We expect this significantly enhanced level of federal, state and local infrastructure investment to yield multiyear demand for our products in this important counter-cyclical end market and drive aggregates shipments to infrastructure closer to our 10-year historical average of 39% of total shipments, as compared to 35% in 2022. Moving now to nonresidential construction, industrial projects of scale, led by energy, onshore manufacturing and datacenters, continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential product shipments. Over the medium term, we expect that enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act will further support and accelerate post-pandemic secular growth trends. This includes restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains, the electric vehicle transition and continued adoption of digital and cloud-based technologies resulting in robust demand within the heavy nonresidential sector. In our supplemental materials, we outlined examples of both in-process and recently announced large industrial projects in our key markets, reflective of these trends. The aggregates intensive nature and multiyear duration of these projects are expected to extend the nonresidential construction cycle. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted light commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect these gains will moderate as these categories generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Shifting to residential. We expect this segment shipments to follow the trend in housing starts, which remain weak. However, we anticipate medium-term improvement as interest and mortgage rates stabilize. Moreover, we expect comparatively positive trends in our Sunbelt markets where there is a significant structural housing deficit due to a decade of underbuilding. As a result, we continue to expect the current housing slowdown will be moderate in our key metropolitan areas as affordability headwinds recede. In summary, we expect 2023 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We anticipate flat aggregates shipments at the midpoint of guidance, as we continue to expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale, we'll largely insulate product shipments from a residential slowdown and a related moderation in light commercial construction. We now expect aggregates pricing growth of 13% to 15%, underscored by attractive 2022 exit rates, early 2023 pricing momentum and a steadfast commitment to our value over volume commercial strategy, which should more than offset continued inflationary pressure and result in expanded gross margins and accelerated unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from cement, downstream operations and Magnesia Specialties, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion or a 15.6% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held for sale. To conclude, we are proud of our 2022 record-setting performance in a dynamic and challenging environment. Equally, we're confident about our 2023 guidance and our ability to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds, while further demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates-led business model. As such, we expect the fourth quarter commercial and margin expansion momentum to accelerate in 2023, resulting in attractive earnings growth and superior value creation for our stakeholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. Volume seems to be a pretty clear, you gave a lot of details. I wanted to focus my question today on pricing. You had very strong double-digit year-over-year pricing and the aggregates in cement and very strong sequential pricing on top of that. Could you clarify your views just in light of price increases for cement early in the year and for aggregates also earlier in the year, the thoughts of resiliency, acceptance and how timing differences this year may impact the cadence versus prior years? Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Please standby, your conference call will resume momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on line. Your conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Speakers, you may resume your conference.
Ward Nye: Kathryn, can you hear me?
Kathryn Thompson: All right. I can repeat the question again.
Ward Nye: Because technology is great when it works and it's terrible when it doesn't. So let's talk about things that work. What's your question, Kathryn?
Kathryn Thompson: Okay, yes, today's has been the day technology for no time. What I said is the volume for the quarter and really kind of as a look toward, makes a lot of sense in terms of what we've seen based on our primary research. I wanted to focus the question on pricing. You had strong double-digit pricing in cement and aggregates, and very strong sequential pricing aggregates building on momentum. You have price increases in January for both cement and aggregates. What is your commentary on resiliency, differences in timing and then also acceptance, given the landscape that we have right now, which is a little bit different? All of it gets into helping us better understand the cadence as we go through '23. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Kathryn, thanks. Thank you for the question, Kathryn. So several things. So let's talk about aggregates first, then we'll talk about cement. So, to your point, 16.5% up in the quarter for aggregates is impressive by any standard. Keep in mind too, that was up 5.6% sequentially. And again, it brought us very much within the range that we had started saying we thought we were going to hit during the year. Obviously, when we look at cement, that was up 20.7% for the quarter, up almost 17% for the full year. So a couple of thoughts on that. One, upstream materials pricing tends to be very resilient. So if we go back over time and look at what has happened in particular with aggregates, aggregates is not a space that gives back pricing. Number two, and I think this is important. Keep in mind, we were moving the pricing as the year went on. As I've said in the prepared remarks, an inflationary environment is hugely helpful for upstream materials. What's the challenge is when it moves so rapidly and moves in big chunks. And that's what happened in 2022. So what I thought was particularly powerful in the quarter is to see margin expansion in Q4 despite the fact volumes were down 12%. So do I think that shows good cost control? Yes. Do I think it shows the power of pricing? Yes. Do I think pricing sticks going into the new year? It's not just that it sticks, I think it continues to expand. Because keep in mind, we're going to continue to see degrees of inflation in our business from our suppliers as well. The difference is now we've caught up with it. So, I think those are important takeaways. Here's another important takeaway, Kathryn, there are two others. Number one, we have moved the vast majority of our customers to January 1 from a price increase. As you may recall from years past, it was somewhat bifurcated, somewhere in January, somewhere in April, the vast majority now are in January. Number two, we indicated to our customers with our price increase letters coming into the new year that we were reserving our rights to come back and have a conversation relative to mid-year price increases as well. We will obviously talk more about that as we get closer to midyear, but here's some important takeaway. The pricing guidance that we have from 13% to 15%, obviously with the midpoint 14%, it does not have in it right now any midyear price increases. So to the extent that we see those during the course of the year, that would obviously trend to the upside on pricing. So, Kathryn, thank you for the question. I hope that's broadly responsive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: Good morning, Ward and Jim. So thanks for the color in the deck. That was very helpful. But, Ward, I was hoping you could dive in a little deeper on your end market expectations, maybe a little more granularity around what is baked into your flat aggregates volume guide for aggregates shipments this year going through each of your end markets and kind of how you get there?
Ward Nye: Happy to, Trey. Thank you for that. So several things. One, if we look at what we believe will be our largest end use in the year, that's going to be infrastructure. We think that's up mid-single digits to high single digits for a number of reasons. One, we outlined at the prepared comments, we have very healthy state DOTs, number one. Number two, if we're looking at highway contract awards, they're up 24% to $80 billion, that's a record number. I mentioned that the Cornyn-Padilla Act that went in really not that long ago is going to add $40 billion just to Martin Marietta top 10 states. That's a big number. We think states will put that money to use. The other thing that I thought was notable as we look at the ballot initiatives from late last year passed at a rate of almost 90%, but importantly, that adds another $23 billion. So when we're looking at already healthy state DOTs, we're looking at Cornyn-Padilla, we're looking at the new long-term highway bill, state initiatives. That's a pretty powerful mix for us, and again, much of what's driving our resilience in that is where. So again, if you go back and look at the states that are so key to us, the Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, California Republic. These states are all in a very good position relative to public infrastructure going forward. As we look at non-res, we see two somewhat different stories in non-res. We think non-res is broadly going to be flat. And here's how we get there. We think large projects of scale, whether it's manufacturing, energy or others and again I think you go back to those states that I was referring you to a minute ago. We think those projects are going to stay very attractive and they tend to be very aggregates intensive work. So do we think having non-res is going to be better? Yes, we do. Do we think like non-res may see some headwinds? Yes, we do. But our view is the heavy piece of it overcomes the light piece of it, leading us to something that we feel like is broadly flat. Look, as we looked at residential, our view is probably not that different than what you seen nationally. The differences are footprint. So do we think single-family res is going to be down? The answer is yes. We think it's going to be down in our footprint, probably 10% to 15%. Again, this is the smallest of our three large end uses. Again, as we're looking in a number of our markets, the biggest issue that we're faced with is not so much affordability, but rather availability, which tells us that housing is going to come under some pressure, probably not as great in our markets as many. The other thing that we think helps mitigate that is we think multifamily is likely to be quite good, and we're seeing good multifamily activity. And then lastly, in our ChemRock and Rail segment. And again, that's going to be railroad balanced, it's going to be, agricultural, lime and others, and we have a bigger end use there than most of our competitors. We feel like that's probably going to be up mid-single digits. So again, as we take infrastructure up, non-res sideways, single family down, ChemRock and Rail up. That leads us broadly to something that we feel like it's going to be flat. But importantly, Trey, part of what we've done is we've gone on a state-by-state basis and we've looked at infrastructure, non-res, res and ChemRock and Rail. And we've tried to look at the jobs that are either in our customers' backlog, we believe that they are well-positioned to get and as we go through that bottoms-up analysis, it brings us from an end-use perspective that we feel like this guide that we put out there is actually a very responsible guide as we look into 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you all for taking the question. Ward, in the press release, you guys talked about some the visibility that you're seeing in the customer backlog. Let's get a lot more context like [technical difficulty] what you're seeing and then by the same token, you mentioned a number of large-scale projects, a number of large scale kind of government funding initiatives. I'd have to think the visibility is extending out pretty far right now, but love to hear kind of how you're thinking about all that?
Ward Nye: Stanley. Thank you so much for the question. As we look at customer backlogs and we do try to get a good sense of where that sits year-over-year. This is pretty heartening to see, aggregates backlogs is up about 7% over where it was last year and perhaps even more importantly, even as we look at it sequentially from Q3, it continues to move in an attractive way. And as we look at the geography in this. The geography is not surprising to me, but I will tell you too, it's actually comforting to me because the East, which is such an important market to us, Stanley, as you know. The East division backlogs are up around 3%. As we look in the Southwest, again, where we have a very significant position, they're up around 7% versus the prior year quarter. The only places that we're seeing some modest movement, not a big surprise is in really parts of the Central United States. At the same time, it's very early there in the season, but even if we look in cement. It's interesting. When I look at our strategic cement business, again, very focused on Dallas-Fort Worth, very focused on Austin and San Antonio. Backlogs are really quite healthy. And importantly, as we look at our downstream businesses, primarily in Texas, we're seeing ready mixed backlogs, very much in line with prior year and keep in mind, to your point, a lot of what we think is going to happen relative to nonresidential is actually ahead of us on these large energy and related projects. So we think those numbers are likely to build during the course of the year. I think it's always important to remember that as we look at these customer backlogs, particularly this time of year, it only represents I want to say 25% to 35% of annual aggregates in cement shipments. So it's not something that's, no pun intended, chiseled in stone, but nonetheless, it's actually a very good indicator of where we think the year is going, And I think your question really ties back into a degree to what Trey asked, when we're looking at our key states, we're looking at a summary. We're looking at all the end uses. As we're looking at that and then going, is the green, is the yellow, is the red? The vast majority of our key states, you're going to see green indicators on those. So, Stanley. I hope that's helpful.
Stanley Elliott: It sure is. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. Hi Ward or Jim, understanding you don't give quarterly guidance, is there a way to think about how the cadence of earnings or volumes might flow over the four quarters of the year? I'm just thinking the catch-up on price cost and IIJA maybe taking some time to get those dollars spent. Is it accurate to think earnings could be more second-half weighted relative to previous years or is there any anyway we can think about that?
Ward Nye: Yes, I'm going to ask Jim to go through in just a second, and give you a little bit more granularity on it. I mean, several things that you know foundationally. Number one, the two slowest quarters end up being Q1 and Q4. As we think about Q4 and the year that we just lapped, obviously, volumes were down in Q4 at 12% and margin expanded. So, oddly enough, as you think about next year, one of the easier comps we're going to have will likely be later in the year. At the same time, if you think about the way some of this may flow through having accelerated pricing towards the beginning of the year, it might make Q1 look a little bit different, but I will turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the rhythm and cadence that we typically see on volumes. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So thinking about a three-year average, if you look-back three years and then comparing that to 2023, what we're expecting, Q1 will be better in 2023 versus the three-year average and then I'd say it's more leveling out at that point. So Q2 maybe a little bit worse than prior Q2s, but still better than prior year in terms of absolute performance. And then, back half should be equal to what we've seen in prior three years or so on average. So Q1 disproportionately better than historical experience and then Q2 a little worse and in the back half pretty similar.
Ward Nye: And again, these are just percentage basis that we're talking about.
Jim Nickolas: Right, Every quarter to be clear will be better than the prior year quarter on an absolute basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: I wonder if we could just continue that conversation around the volume comps in the first half of the year, you had an outstanding first quarter of '22, seasonally adjusted run rate was closer to 218 million tons versus the 208 million tons run rate that we're looking for in the guide for '23. So, correct me if I'm wrong, Jim, it sounds like we should be expecting volumes to be down year-over-year just based on the comps through at least the first quarter if not the second quarter. I just want to make sure we're calibrated on the volume cadence over the course of '23.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, that's right, that's right. But the bigger difference is for Q1 outperformance relative to history for '23 is in the price cost spread again versus last quarter. So, that's right. Q1 slightly down, but then growing and exceeding prior year for the remaining three quarters of the year.
Ward Nye: And Jerry, if you reflect on the way these public dollars are going to come through. I think that's actually pretty consistent with what we said last year on how we thought the year would likely build throughout the year. So to Jim's point, we're talking two different things, one, volume, the other is financially, and I think to Jim's point, we're going to see a much better year financially each quarter. I think we're going to see a very attractive sequential build each quarter relative to volumes, and again, I think that's pretty consistent with where we've been and I'd be surprised if you're surprised by that.
Jerry Revich: Super. Appreciate the discussion and outstanding performance, gross profit per ton by the team. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ward Nye: Phil, are you on-mute?
Operator: Phil Ng, your line is open, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Tyler Brown: I was just hoping to unpack the non-aggregates gross profit guidance. I think it implies maybe $50 million in growth at the midpoint, if my math is right, but conceptually, got a lot of pricing momentum in cement, natural gas has really rolled over from when we talked back in October. So if you add that backdrop, shouldn't we see really strong gross profit growth in cement midyear in a hedge position that I'm missing. But does that imply that the downstream business maybe you're expecting gross profit dollars to maybe be flat or down or is that not the case?
Ward Nye: All right. I think in large measure what you're saying is right. You're going to see very attractive growth in cement. Number two, remember, we divested about 3 million cubic yards of ready mixed last year and the other thing that has weighed on the downstream businesses have been the input costs, among them aggregates and cement. So in many respects, we have by design pushed a lot of that to our upstream business. So again, you're seeing a business overall that's much more narrow and downstream, much more focused, as we've long been on upstream. I do believe your points around cement are really well taken. I think we anticipate a very impressive cement business this year in Dallas and in San Antonio and in Austin. So, I hope that answers your question specifically. Did I hit what you needed?
Tyler Brown: Yes. That is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is now open.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. In the previous question, you highlighted your expectations but infrastructure and nonresidential. I was curious on your comments on light nonresidential being negative. First off, what specifically do you mean by light nonresidential and what kind of indicators you're looking at showing that that you headlined.
Ward Nye: I think we're talking more to, Keith, about office retail, the types of things that would typically follow single-family housing, and again, we're not seeing and taking a deep negative dive, let me be really clear on that. We think it's just going to follow housing for a bit of time. In fact, we think housing, particularly by the time we get to '24 is probably in a pretty reasonable recovery mode. So we feel like the particularly light has never gotten particularly robust to tell you the truth. So we feel like it probably sees a bit of a dip, but if you're looking specifically, it's hospitality, it's retail, it's degrees of office. So as we're looking at manufacturing, as we're looking at energy, as we're looking at warehousing or data or others, we see that actually is quite strong, but I just want to make sure I'm tying it for you back fairly specifically to those types of light things that would typically follow residential with depending on the market, a nine to an 18-month lag.
Keith Hughes: Okay, one other question too on cement. You have cost headwinds in the quarter. Do you think those headwinds remain at the same level in the first half? I know you said, energy, you expect to be kind of flattish. Is there anything else that's potentially coming that would be an offset by this pricing you're getting?
Ward Nye: I don't think there's going to be anything like energy was last year. I mean, to Jim's points, when he was going through his commentary. I mean overall energy was such a massive headwind to the enterprise. And obviously, cement is a big consumer of energy. I mean, keep in mind $178 million headwind for the year in energy. Now, in fairness, diesel was about half of that, but again, if you're looking at our business in cement or if you're looking at our business even in Mag Specialties, what you'll know is portions of that energy was just up a lot more. I mean, natural gas, depending on the market last year was up around 30%. Coke in some markets was up as much as 116% and coal was up nearly 20%. So to your point, do we think we'll see that degree of lapping again, increases in energy? No, I doubt. But I think Jim has a little bit more. If you'd like to offer you two.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Two points, Keith. One, maintenance repairs will be higher in '23 for the full year than in '22 for cement. Despite that, however, gross margin percentage, I expect will be higher in '23 than '22.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phil Ng: Hi, guys, can you hear me now?
Ward Nye: Welcome back. We missed you, Phil.
Phil Ng: Thank you. I mean a day of technology fun for both us. So I apologize for that.
Ward Nye: You're telling you know about the fly, Phil.
Phil Ng: So, Ward. I mean, you sound pretty excited about the opportunity on the public infrastructure side and I just want to make sure we don't get carried away just because there's always labor issues, supply chain and how this stuff could ramp up. Just the level of confidence you're seeing from your customers whether they're making investments on the labor side, just the visibility on how that kind of ramps up and you kind of highlighted some other longer-term acts like the IRA, CHIPS Act and then something new today, Cornyn-Padilla. Those three things, how does that kind of ramp, we generally have a better feel for IIJA.
Ward Nye: Yes. I think the others ramp very naturally throughout the year and that's why I think going back to Jim's point, the cadence is going to be attractive financially all the way through. The cadence from a volume perspective will likely be second-half weighted. And I think our confidence around a lot of that is driven by some of the things that we've seen even recently. I'm sure you saw, Phil, that Governor DeSantis has recently announced, for example, a new legislative proposal in Florida to allocate $7 billion to accelerate timing of critical road projects in that state. I was actually in Florida last week and one of the big issues that they were indicating is we're concerned about an aggregates shortage and of course, we're going to do all we can to make sure that they don't have an aggregates shortage in Florida. And as you may recall, Phil, it's so interesting to me to see that we did 208 million tons last year. And remember, this organization did 205 million tons back in 2005, 2006, and we've added 15 million tons of capacity on a per annum basis to what we've done since then. So to your point, if there is a need, can we put it on a spec product on the ground to meet it? Absolutely we can, number one. Number two, do I think contractors over the last year have done what they needed to in varying degrees to have a labor force that's ready for what's coming? I think they have. Number three. I think the labor pool is moving around a bit, and what I mean by that is, even if they need to now go to the well and hire more, I think the opportunities are going to be there. So to your point. I think the states have pretty heady expectations on what they're going to do. Importantly, they have pretty heady budgets that can help further that. Number three, we have the capacity to feed it. And number four, contractors have seen this picture coming and I think they've put themselves in a position to perform, Phil. So again, I hope that's helpful and responsive.
Phil Ng: Yes, that's great color. And sorry to sneak one in, you've given some color on how to think about demand for aggregates. Texas cement. I mean, Texas is a different animal altogether, just giving the funding. How should we think about the demand backdrop for Texas cement this year?
Ward Nye: Yes. I think the demand backdrop will continue to be attractive in Texas and I think the thing that you need to remember. I think about Texas through several different lenses. Ours is primarily on cement, focused on the Metroplex, Dallas-Fort Worth, which is where the biggest single piece of our cement business is going. Secondarily, it's going to be on Central Texas, which is let's call it mid-30% of our cement is going. So by the time we get to South Texas or West Texas, we're talking about markets that from a percentage perspective on the zip code of 10%. If we look overall at the way cadence has typically gone in cement. I mean, if we look at last year, for example, we sold a little bit over 1 million tons in Q1, 1.1 million tons in Q2, 1 million tons in Q3, and then in a very weather impacted Q4, 950 million tons. So much of cement is going to ready mixed that's not as sensitive to weather for example as asphalt and paving is and you should see a pretty steady cadence to the cement shipments. Obviously, you're going to see s different pricing construct early in the year in that business, so. I hope that gives you a sense of the rhythm on how we think that's going to work, Phil?
Phil Ng: Should we expect it to be up or kind of flattish to like aggregates, on the shipment side.
Ward Nye: Obviously, we're not giving shipment guidance, but we talked about the fact that it's a sold-out market and we sold 4.2 million tons last year, so. I'll put it this way, Phil. We're selling everything we make in that marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, Ward, Jim and Jennifer. Ward, maybe for Jim, if you could discuss. So you talk about.
Ward Nye: Mike, I'm sorry to interrupt you. You need to you need to lean in to hear you better. It's hard to hear you.
Michael Dudas: Can you hear me now?
Ward Nye: Yes, sir, much better.
Michael Dudas: Can you talk about capital allocation for 2023. Any shift given that you've assimilated the acquisition from 2021 and maybe how cash flows trending, working capital use because of revenues improving and the capital expenditures you're thinking for 2023, any shift amongst the three buckets that we should be thinking about?
Ward Nye: Yes, let me take the front end of that and talk about priorities. Jim will come back and give you some specifics on what different elements of that are looking like. What I would say is this. If you go back in time, you recall, 2021 was the year of large transactions for us, the largest transactions from a cash perspective the company has ever done. 2022 was largely a year in that dimension of integrating businesses, making sure they were looking, feeling and acting like Martin Marietta businesses, making sure we had the price increases then and putting ourselves in a position that we could de-lever our balance sheet. So if you recall, we like to be in a two to two and a half times position net debt-to-EBITDA through a cycle. We're at the top end of that right now. Obviously, if we look at where we think we would be at year end, absent M&A, we will be considerably lower in that we think from a cash-flow perspective and otherwise this can be very attractive. So to answer your question directly. Have our priorities changed? No. We want to continue growing this business. We want to continue to invest in the upstream business. Part of what I believe we've done too, now with the coast-to-coast business, is we have even served to de-risk M&A going forward more. And what I mean by that is most of the places in which we want to grow in large measure, we have a footprint today, which means the integration that we're going to have going forward gets to be integration done with people who work for our business, who understand our culture, who understand our operating philosophy and who understand our commercial philosophy as well. Now, Jim will take you through some of the other questions you had relative to capex and otherwise in cash flow, and I think what you'll find is we have a series of very high class problems that we need to worry about. So, Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yes, so our EBITDA obviously is expected to grow meaningfully. Some of that extra cash flow from the earnings will be deployed in capex. So capex is growing, we raised that from $480 million this year, it's closer to $600 million next year. So that'll be a part of it that's of course helping with future growth. Beyond that, by and large, the rest of the capital should be, the cash should flow through and we will have available for deployment pursuing our priority list of acquisitions, upstream acquisitions first and then returning capital to shareholders.
Ward Nye: Mike, did we get you what you need?
Michael Dudas: Yes, thanks, gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Michael Feniger: Thanks for taking my question. Clearly a nice pricing year in 2023, building up 2022. Just curious, Ward. If you think that volumes stay in this plus two, minus two range, can that still support high single-digit, double-digit pricing in 2024. I know it's early to think about 2024 already. Just curious what headwinds could lead to that price growth in 2023, rolling over in 2024 or conversely, what would still support that level of pricing as we go into exit this year into next year? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Michael, thank you for the question. And you're right, it's probably too early to lean too far in 2024. What I'll remind everyone is this pricing in these upstream materials has always been very resilient, number one. Number two, we do not sell a discretionary product. These are products that people need. Number three, we're a very small portion of overall construction. Next, much of the inflation contractors and others have seen on a percentage basis, particularly during '22, we're actually ahead of where we were because we protect contractors on bids. Obviously, we were going to be chasing that for a good part of the year, then we caught up with it towards the end of the year. Obviously, we would like not to be behind that again. Part of what I've spoken to our team about is this notion of being in a position that we can look realistically and responsibly and at least two price increases a year. I indicated before that 13% to 15 %that we have for this year does not have in it mid-year price increases despite the fact that we've told our customers in letters that we will be looking at that at midyear. So I haven't answered your question definitively relative to '24, because at this point I simply can't. But if I look at the building blocks that I believe you can look at and investors can look at and have a good way to think about it. I think the color that I put around that gives you a pretty good runway toward how you can put a notion towards it.
Michael Feniger: Thank you.
Ward Nye: Operator? Yes, go ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Brent Thielman: Thank you. Lot covered here. I guess just one, Ward. As If you look beyond the impact of sort of inclement weather this quarter, more from the view of what you've seen in the business during months where you're able to get product out, how would you characterize the headwinds you've really seen from residential end markets so far. Is it already in the zip code of that 10% to 15% decline you're talking about for '23 or have you been surprised at the resiliency?
Ward Nye: It's been interesting. I'll go to your point. I think you raised a good question on what the underlying marketplace looks like and here's the way that I've thought about it. If we look at the fourth quarter that was heavily weather impacted. Infrastructure was down 11%, non-res was down 12%, res was down in that zip code that we think that they were saying it's going to be doing, mid-teens, right. And we still saw expanded margin. But here's what I know. There's gobs of infrastructure work to be done out there, which tells me when I'm looking at these numbers down those percentage, it was more a weather event in our markets as opposed to a market-driven event in our markets. So to your point, what we're kind of seeing as we go through. It means we're looking at things right now, I will tell you, business relative to plan on where we thought we would be. And frankly, business looks a little better than plan right now. So again, as we're looking at a very soft Q4 for all the reasons we discussed, as we've looked at what we are guiding toward flat and as we look at least as much as you can tell in January and February with a big caveat that it's January and February, it looks pretty good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up real quick just on that last point you made, Ward, about the first quarter looking a little bit better than your plan. I'd imagine that's more than just pent-up demand from weather delays in the fourth quarter. So just want to confirm that and then maybe just on the cost side for aggregates. Wondering if you could maybe provide some more color on what you're assuming outside of the diesel observation?
Ward Nye: Sure, I'll do them in two ways. Then, I'm going to ask Jim to come back and talk to you a little bit about cost per ton and the cost buckets. To your point, if we think about what we've seen so far this year, Garik, California's had pretty epic rains. If you think about the cold weather that settled in on Texas here a couple of weeks ago. I mean, that was basically a week lost in Texas, and of course, Texas is our largest state by revenue. And but you're in the Midwest, you're in Cleveland, you've seen a very cold winter so far this year. So as we're seeing activity in what has not been in many respects the kindest month and a half so far, it's that degree of resilience that we're seeing that gives us the confidence that we have the guide right now and obviously that's just looking in large measure at the level of activity. We're not even speaking about the level of pricing in that context, Garik. So does that help you?
Garik Shmois: Yes, it does and the comment around the Midwest being cold has certainly resonated.
Ward Nye: I would imagine. Let Jim come back and talk a little bit about the different cost buckets.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So if you're holding energy aside, which I think you did in your question, it's high single digits is the cost inflation we're expecting for 2023. It's pretty broad based across personnel, supplies, repairs, contract services, et-cetera. So obviously that's all contemplated in our guide. We just are happy to see our ASP outstripping that growth and leading to the margin expansion. Does that answer your question, Garik?
Garik Shmois: Yes, it does. Thanks for that and others.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Joe Nolan: Hi, good morning this is Joe Nolan on for David. So. I guess first, just wondering transportation seemed to be pretty problematic throughout 2022. Just wondering how you're thinking about transportation heading into 2023 and how that might have factored into your guidance?
Ward Nye: That's a great question and what I would tell you is we were waiting all year for it to get better and it did get better. As we were seeing the year ramp up, we were certainly seeing rail activities going better than they had for a while. So we're heartened by that. But I think the other thing that I was really comforted by was really after what was a pretty challenging half one for trucking, trucking got better in the second half of the year. So as trucking clearly got better in half two, we just in wetter and obviously the railroads had a difficult time for much of 2022. Service picked up pretty notably as we got towards the end of the year and that's both in the East and the West. And your question, such a good one. Joe, because you'll recall, we shipped more stone by rail than any other aggregates producer in the United States, probably two x our closest competitor. So there's a sense in which rails performance in 2022 combined with what was a pretty tough half one on trucking, was going to serve to be a more meaningful impediment to us than it wants to others. So as rail continues to get better and as trucking gets better, I think we will certainly feel the benefit of that perhaps in ways that others won't, Joe.
Joe Nolan: That's great, thank you. And if I could one quick a follow-up. You mentioned earlier on a question that you do not have any midyear pricing actions factored into the guidance. Was that strictly for aggregates or was that for other segments as well.
Ward Nye: That was for everything.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Rohit Seth: Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on aggregate prices, you mentioned the 13% to 15% increase does not include a second half increase and there has been broad acceptance of an increase. Being early in the year, I'm just curious, is the confidence on realizing the increase is a reflection of your internal downstream operations stepping in increase or is this the market competition is going along with it. And then the second part of that is, is there any mix in your footprint that might be helping Martin versus say the broader market, I'm thinking about North Carolina here?
Ward Nye: Yes, no, that's a great question. Thank you, Rohit. So, I would say could say several things. One, the customer acceptance of the price increases has been good. So let's start with that. So we've seen widespread. They understand it, they've seen their own input pressures. They know that we're feeling it. So number one, it's been well received. Number two, you're right. But keep in mind, we treat our business the same way that we treat outside businesses to the extent that we're downstream. So we know what that's obviously going to look like. Number three, to your point on whether there's any mix issues. I would say that I mentioned during the course of the dialog I was having earlier with respect to backlogs. These backlog is nicely up year-over-year. Southwest backlog is equally nicely up year-over-year. East from at least a mix perspective are some of our highest margins markets, so to the extent that that business continues to go an attractive way. That could certainly be a help relative to mix. Obviously, more to come. It's early. I indicated, that's typically 25% to 30% of a full year's volume. So more to come, but I hope that answers your question, Rohit?
Rohit Seth: It does. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to hand the call back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Well, again. Thank you all so much for joining today's earnings conference call.

The question-and-answer session will follow please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that Martin Marietta delivered record results in the third quarter. This is despite current macroeconomic challenges that include persistent inflationary pressure across multiple cost categories, tighter monetary policies and heightened geopolitical tensions. Our quarterly performance is a testament to our team's commitment to commercial excellence, and execution of our strategic business plan. The results also reflect our successful implementation of double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines, that combined with acquisition contributions, drove record quarterly consolidated total revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per diluted share. Importantly too, our year-to-date safety and health performance, inclusive of acquired operations remains at world class levels as measured by both total injury and lost time incident rates. While we acknowledge and celebrate our continuous safety and health improvement, our work in this vital dimension is never done. In addition, on August 9, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. This transaction aligns with our commitment to an aggregates-led business, complemented by strategic cement assets in certain markets, improves the durability of our business through cycles and provides balance sheet flexibility to continue driving shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investment and attractive acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders for reducing net leverage to within the company's targeted range. As highlighted in today's release, we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the third quarter, including consolidated total revenues increased 16% to $1.81 billion. Consolidated adjusted gross profit increased 8% to $488 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $533 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 10% to $4.69. These results on flat organic aggregate shipments underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which multiple pricing actions were successfully implemented this year. However, inflationary trends also impacted our operating costs and affected our adjusted consolidated gross margin, which declined 200 basis points to 26.9% for the quarter. Notably, this is both a moderated pace and sequentially higher as compared with the second quarter of 2022. As a result of the current demand environment and persistently high inflation, we've advised customers of fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets as well as broad based January 1, 2023 increases. We believe these commercial initiatives together with other inflation containment actions, position Martin Marietta well to expand margins in the fourth quarter, and deliver another year of strong profitability in 2023. For our company, if past is prologue, and we believe that it is as inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures abate. Let's now turn to our third quarter operating performance starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregate demand across the company with total aggregate shipments inclusive of acquisitions, increasing 5.6% to a quarterly record of 60.2 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments were largely flat, as otherwise strong demand was offset by supply chain disruptions, inclement weather in certain key markets, and most notably, logistics constraints and cement shortages, the latter curbing the immediate need for aggregates in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete. Aggregates pricing fundamentals from a very attractive and organic aggregates pricing increased 11.9% or 11.3% on a mixed adjusted basis. The cumulative effect of multiple pricing actions continued to build in third quarter. These disciplined actions combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility bode well for meaningful price acceleration in the fourth quarter, and in 2023. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply resulting in effectively sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop, and combined with our cement team’s focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record third quarter shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 21.4% as our second $12 per ton increase this year, went into effect on July 1. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future supportive of our recently announced $20 per ton price increase effective January 1, 2023. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 16.8%, largely due to a historically wet August in North Texas, as well as the completion of certain large projects in the quarter. Organic pricing increased to 20.3%, reflecting multiple price actions, including fuel surcharges necessary to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments increased 4.3%, driven primarily by strong demand in Colorado, while organic pricing improved 22% to help offset the increase in raw materials costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen, notably for comparative purposes prior year, asphalt volumes were constrained by bitumen shortage in Colorado, including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments and pricing increased 31.3% and 26.1%, respectively. Before discussing our preliminary 2023 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with review of our financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. And good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.61 billion, a 15.9% increase over last year, and an adjusted product gross profit record of $467 million, an increase of 10.9%. Adjusted aggregates product gross profit improved 10.5% relative to the prior year's quarter to a record $330 million. Adjusted aggregate product gross margin declined 240 basis points to 32.5% as robust pricing growth had not yet offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs. Our Texas cement business delivered all time, quarterly records for top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 23.4% to $163 million, while gross profit increased 35.7% to $68 million. Importantly, execution of a discipline commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 380 basis points to 41.5%. That was despite notable energy costs headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. Domestic production capacity constraints and strong demand contributes to extremely tight supply in the North and Central Texas markets. As a reminder, we are taking two notables, near term steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. First, we're in the midst of conversions at our Midlothian and Hunter plant to manufacture a less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. This eco-friendly product has been approved by the Texas Department of Transportation, and we believe our customers will view it as providing significant stakeholder benefits. Once we have completed our transition to Type 1L, our cement production capacity will increase by approximately 10%. Second, we are installing a new finish mill at our Midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. This new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of much needed incremental production capacity to the Texas marketplace. Our third quarter ready-mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1, and include the acquired Arizona operations impacting the comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, ready-mixed concrete product revenues declined 29.1% to $227 million, and gross profit declined 40.3% to $90 million, driven primarily by the divestiture which was partially offset by contributions from the acquired operations. Increased raw material costs further weighed on the gross margin for the quarter. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $310 million, a 58.1% increase and record adjusted gross profit of $50 million, a 22.9% increase, however, continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to the adjusted product gross margin decline of 470 basis points to 16.3%. Magnesia specialties generated product revenues of $69 million, a 4% decrease, driven largely by lower demand for domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products. Product gross profit declined 22.9% to $22 million, as higher energy costs resulted in gross margin compression of 770 basis points to 31.3%. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $50 million in nonrecurring gains from the sale of surplus land and other assets. We saw sequential moderation in diesel costs in the third quarter. During the month of October, diesel prices have trended back up. While we anticipate additional volatility in diesel prices. We are forecasting that fourth quarter prices approximate current levels. As a result, with diesel costs no longer increasing sequentially, coupled with our discipline pricing initiatives, we expect to return to expanding gross margins in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior year period. We remain focused on a disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business, while also returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $141 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 288,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $347 per share in the third quarter. We also reduced gross leverage this past quarter. On September 29, the company utilized cash on the balance sheet to satisfy and discharge a $700 million tranche of senior notes due July 2023. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued to trend down and ended the quarter at 2.6x. We continue to anticipate a return to the top end of our target net leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x by year end. Additionally, the company's board of directors approved an 8% increase in a quarterly cash dividend paid in September underscoring its confidence in our future performance and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend is now $2.64 per share. Since our repurchased authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2022 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results as well as the impact of lower expected aggregate volumes and continued inflationary pressure. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1, 610 million to $1,675 million which excludes the nonrecurring gain on the divestiture in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, demand from expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment coupled with heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to offset near-term affordability driven headwinds in the historically under build residential sector. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these needed products and supported by our locally led pricing strategy will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. As we enter the fourth quarter, aggregates customer backlogs are ahead of prior year levels, with supply chain challenges continuing to serve as the primary governor, the growth of product shipments. In the third quarter, infrastructure shipments accounted for 36% of total volumes, in the current period of broader economic uncertainty, one constant theme across our footprint is that infrastructure. Our single largest end used market is poised for accelerated growth as already healthy state Department of Transportation, or DOT budgets receive incremental funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA through the allocation for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. Notably, for the first eight months of the year, Federal aid highway construction obligations for the company's top 10 states are up 28% relative to the prior year period. As a result, we expect a step change in the public sector investment in 2023 to provide a stable base level of demand for years to come. Aggregate shipments for nonresidential end market accounted for 35% of total third quarter volumes. Nonresidential construction project backlogs remain strong in our markets led in large measure by heavy side energy, critical product manufacturing and data center projects of scale. The announcements of these projects are accelerating, driven by a post pandemic shift in global energy and manufacturing supply chains as well as data usage from adoption of digital and cloud-based services. Illustrative projects in our markets include Golden Pass LNG, and CPChem’s plastic facility along the Texas Gulf Coast. Samsung's semiconductor operation in Austin, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix, Stellantis, Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, both VinFast electric vehicle and Wolfspeed plan chip manufacturing site near Raleigh, Durham, and metadata centers in Kansas City and Des Moines. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted like commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect this recovery will moderate as these categories generally follows single family residential development. Not surprisingly, the residential end market, which accounts for 23% of our total third quarter shipments began to slow down in the third quarter as organic shipments of the sector decreased 3% following the decline in single family housing starts, which was partially offset by continued strength in multifamily construction. That said, housing across our Sunbelt footprint remains under built amid significant population inflows with demand far exceeding supply. As shown in our supplemental slides, single family housing starts per capita in our key metro areas remains significantly and to varying degrees below peak 2005 levels. As such, we continue to expect the current affordability driven single family housing slowdown to be moderate in our key metropolitan areas, as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium. As we look to 2023, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments to be effectively flat. As we expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale will largely insulate product shipments from a slowdown in the single-family residential sector. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will continue to be supported by attractive 2022 exit rates, as well as realization of our announced January 1, 2023 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low double-digit growth in aggregates pricing in 2023. To conclude, we're proud of our record setting performance against a challenging backdrop. We expect our current momentum to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and in 2023, resulting in a return to margin expansion. We remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our strategic plan. In doing so, we're confident in our ability to successfully navigate the current macro-economic challenges are demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates led business model. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stan Elliott with Stifel.
Stan Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, you mentioned the infrastructure piece has been critical in the next year. Can you talk a little bit more about the state budgets? Kind of what you're seeing how it looks right now? And their ability to get projects and lettings out the door for you.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Stanley. Thank you for the question. I guess several things, one, not all states are going to be created equal. And part of what we've been focused on is building our business in the right states. So if we look at our top 10 states, overall, we're seeing basically budgets for next year that are up around 10%. And that can move around a lot. So for example, North Carolina, our home state here up 11%, Florida, up 27%, South Carolina important state for us up 28%. Part of what we're seeing too is not just increased funding, but in many respects, Stanley, the way that states are looking at funding. So for example, in North Carolina 2% of sales tax in FY23 will find their way to infrastructure, that's going to work its way up to 4% than 6% over a multi-year period. At the same time, even reflecting on Florida, Florida recently passed in their FY23 budget, basically a historic high. And they're looking at $4.4 billion for highway construction and another $1.2 billion just for resurfacing. And then if we're looking at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their 10-year unified transportation program is $85 billion worth of projects, to try to contextualize that that's a 13% increase from the ‘22 plan. So the nice thing is when you sit back and look at what we're going to have, from a baseline from IIJA, which is going to be the single largest pop we've seen since the Interstate Highway Act went into law in 1956. And then you feather on top of that very healthy state budgets. It's a pretty attractive backdrop. It's important to see to Stanley, I think, to your question, if we're looking at those same top 10 states in contract awards here today, they're up around 13%. But importantly, to us, we're looking at federal aid, highway construction obligations, year-to-date. Those are also up 28%. So as we think about what public is going to look like for us next year, on the federal side, plus to your question on the state piece of it. We think that's attractive, and it starts leading us back towards volume on public that looks more like history, in the low 40% of our volume, as opposed to what you heard me speak to just moments ago, which was in the high 30s. So, Stanley, I hope that helps.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thomson Research Group.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. It was great color on the public end market. And you've also given some good color into early pricing actions between 3% return per ton increase for cement and low teens for aggregates. But when we look at the private side, what gives you confidence particularly focusing on customer backlogs about what to expect for 2023 and particular more color on backlogs that you're seeing right now. That gives a view for next year. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Kathryn, thank you for the question. Look, as we look at customer backlogs compared to where we were last year, this time. In aggregates they're actually nicely up about 7%. If we look in ready-mixed, they're also up. If we look in cement it's broadly flat. And we're expecting actually to pick up some nice work in Q4. And keep in mind and cement, we're dealing with the market in Texas that is uniquely largely sold out. So if we're looking at backlogs today for customers versus where we were a year ago, it's actually pretty attractive. I think the other piece of your question that's so important, Kathryn, as we think about ‘23, our view is clearly public is going to be healthier, as we think about ‘23, the heavy side of nonres, and we look at that through projects that are in the process of being led. We also look at projects and square footage that's out there in particular, we're seeing the heavy side of nonres manufacturing, energy, et cetera being very attractive the markets in which we're operating. Do we think we're likely to see some degree of moderation in the light nonres? Probably so. Do I think the US is going to see a degree of cooling in single family housing, we already have, I think that persists. But I think if we look at multi residential housing, that's going to be really resilient, we're probably going to see a nice pop, and that. So as we step back and look at backlogs, and think about end users, public appears to be quite healthy, nonres on the heavy side is quite healthy. Multifamily res is healthy, and we think single family residential, and the light side of non is where we're likely to see varying degrees of weakness. Now one of the things that we've been careful to do, and you see it in our supplemental slides, we've tried to spell out with specificity certain key MSAs, four of them in the West, four of them in the East, that we think are indicative of what's happened to population in our key MSAs. And what's happened to housing. I think an analysis of that will reveal to the extent that the US feels some degree of headwinds on housing, ours will not be as pronounced. So Kathryn, I've tried to deal with both the public and the private side to give you some good data points on why we have the degree of resilience we do around relatively flat volumes going into 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ward, your summit pricing there in the quarter very impressive performance and looking into 2003. How much of today's pricing will be carried over from this year into next year. And then you mentioned having some widespread increases in January. And we've heard of some being announced for the Texas summit market in the in the January timeframe. But if you could comment on that, and maybe around the magnitude you're expecting there.
Ward Nye: Look, it's been, thank you for the Trey, for the question, Trey. It's been a good year for pricing. And for Texas summit this year. We anticipate that's going to recur next year. I mean, if we look at ASP for the quarter, it was up 21.4% on a reported basis, 20.6% on a mix adjusted basis. What that's done to your point in cement is basically led to a new all-time record for gross product. And you can see gross margins that are above 40%. If we think about the Texas cement market, here's some things to remember, I think this gives you a good build on why we have resilience, around a $20 per ton increase effective January 1. That's a market that's going to consume around 20 million ton of cement per annum. But it's a market that has a capacity to produce it in the state of Texas at about 16 million tons. In other words, that goes back to my commentary in the prepared remarks that the markets effectively sold out. So keep in mind we've got two plants, one in Midlothian, one at Hunter, so we're in Central and North Texas, frankly where water imports are not particularly meaningful to what we're doing. So I wouldn't say all of that underscores why we have resilience around the pricing. The other piece of it that I think is important, and I think it likely recurs is I'm not going to lead you to believe that we have enormous amounts of material going to basically oil well cement. But there is some going to West Texas, those are actually a much higher ASPs than you'd see ordinarily. And I think reflecting back on the geopolitical tensions that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It's hard to imagine that that piece of our business is going to slow. The other things that I think are important to keep in mind, Trey. One, we're also seeing a conversion, as Jim said in his comments to the Type 1L cement. In that process, we'll actually get about 10% more capacity as we go into next year. And then it won't be immediate next year, but you will see more capacity come online as we finish mill that's underway at Midlothian right now. That's going to add another 450,000 tons to that marketplace that actually desperately needs it. So again, $20 a ton is what we're looking for. I think that answers your question specifically. But again, I wanted to give you some other data to give you a sense of why we have a high degree of confidence in that number.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Ward, I'm wondering if you could talk about, Ward, if we were to assume a mild recession next year and volumes are down year-over-year versus the base case of flat, it feels like with the pricing gains over the course of this year, you folks would still be positioned to expand aggregates margins by a couple of hundred basis points, given the puts and takes in that scenario. I'm wondering if you might be willing to comment on that just conceptually, given the timing of permanent price increase over the course of this year versus the quicker diesel and other inflation that we saw in the beginning of the year and as a result, the catch-up we're going to see in '23?
Ward Nye: Sure, Jerry. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. Your question, which I think is a really good one, really focuses on margin and what we think happens with volumes. So several things that I would point out. One, if you look at what we're saying for the balance of the year, we're actually anticipating margin expansion returning in Q4. So what that means is multiple price increases in a big heavy industry are actually finally catching up and passing what have been the cost inputs. We also expect that to recur going into next year. Now to your point, what happens if you see volume more bearish than we anticipate volume being next year. What I would do is I'd take you back, and it's been a while, Jerry, this might have before you were actually following us, but if we go back to 2005, 2006 and '07, what you'll actually see if you look at history, is the industry generally, Martin Marietta specifically, was finding peak volumes back in 2005, but we're actually seeing peak profitability in that last cycle in 2006, which underscores in many respects why we speak to this volume -- this value over volume strategy because we recognize how valuable that is to our business. The other thing that I'll outline, Jerry, because you've seen it, and I think it's probably echoed in some of your writings as well. The pricing in aggregates tends to be a very durable set of pricing. So as we go through cycles inevitably in the fullness of time, and I'm not sure if next year is going to be a down cycle or not, we don't think it will be right now because of the strength in public. We have a lot of confidence around the resiliency of the aggregate pricing. So as we think about what is likely to happen in margins in Q4, we think they expand. If we look at what we think is likely to happen to margins in '23. Again, we think they likely expand. So hopefully, that answers your question and maybe 10% more, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Phil Ng: Hey, guys. Appreciate the forward color for 2023. So maybe a question for Jim. Your flat volume guidance, appreciating a lot of uncertainty on housing and maybe on the light side for commercial. Can you kind of help us unpack the percentage growth you're assuming for housing, nonres and infrastructure? And on the infrastructure side, we could appreciate the lightings and bidding activity has really dialed up. But more help us understand kind of like the cadence of when that big inflection kind of comes through next year? Thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Look, I think you're going to start through the inflection as we get closer toward half year next year, in particular. Keep in mind, it's always interesting to me, people want to look at Q1 and try to divine some degree of rhythm or cadence out of Q1. And remember, in our world, Q1 is January, February and March. And what I've long said is oftentimes Q1 is made or broken by the last two weeks in March, which is no way to really judge the rest of the year. I think going back to the percentages that I spoke to a little while ago and infrastructure gives you a good sense of what that rhythm and cadence can look like through the balance of the year, I think part of what we're going to be seeing, and I think this is important, Phil, is in infrastructure, we're going to be seeing more capacity type projects led than we've seen in the more recent past. That's important because you're going to send out a much wider array of volumes and more volumes over a period of years. So I would reflect on that. The other thing that I would say in particular, and a lot of this is driven by energy and manufacturing. If we look on the nonres side, what we're seeing, and I mentioned it before, the square footage on a number of these plants, not just in Texas but beyond that, even on some of the new opportunities that we're seeing in the Carolinas and in the central part of the United States, have considerable square footage. These tend to be almost concrete warehousing. And then the other thing that we are seeing is we are seeing estimated start dates now on all of the large LNG or energy plants that we've been looking at in South Texas, all with 2023 start dates and we think that's important as well because when we look at those projects all by themselves and again, I'm talking about six different projects in South Texas, the cumulative yardage and tons from those are 13.7 million tons and about 1.3 million cubic yards. So again, we feel like on those, it won't just be an aggregate or a concrete play for us and varying degrees, it can be a cement play as well. So I would certainly start looking to begin in Q2 to see those volumes ramp up. I think it will particularly be in public. I think you're going to see the heavy side of nonres on manufacturing and in energy actually do quite well. I do think areas like hospitality and others are likely going to slow. It will be curious to see how single-family housing goes in our markets. As I said, I don't think those are going to go off a cliff. I don't think there's room for them to go off a cliff because we're looking at seasonally adjusted starts right now below $900,000. And using a million is a good, steady start. And keep in mind, many of these markets, we are still -- it's not an affordability issue. It's an availability issue. So I think in many respects, it will be curious to see what homebuilders are willing to do relative to their margins. But from a timing perspective, Phil, that's the way I would think about it, and that's how I would handicap it via end users.
Phil Ng: And Ward, the heavy side pushing a lot of momentum there. Is that enough to like more than offset the light side, at least when you think about 2023?
Ward Nye: I think the scope of some of those heavy projects are so large. I think the short answer is yes, it really can, particularly some of these large energy projects. So I think that's where you end up potentially with that nonres wash. I think that's probably a good word to use.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.
Timna Tanners: Yes, thanks. I wanted to squeeze in two really, hopefully, quick ones. One is you talk about the constraints from cement availability. And I was just wondering how we should think about that improving given some of the expansions you've talked about from existing capacity, yours and others. And then same idea, a smaller market, but on the Magnesia Specialty side, your guidance assumes a rebound. So is it just a short-term blip you see in the demand side? Or is this something that could perpetuate into next year? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Sure. Timna, thanks for the question. So a couple of things on Mag. I think we anticipate really more of the same from Mag in Q4. I think we actually expect a better year for Mag next year. A couple of things are driving that right now. Steel is run at about 77% of capacity, which is lower than it's been for a while. The chemical side of that business is actually performing quite well. That business has a number of commercial contracts that are rolling off at the end of this year. So as we think about the rhythm and cadence of what that's going to look like from a pricing perspective, next year is actually going to be much more attractive for that business. So that's how I think of that. If I think about the ready-mixed market, in particular, back to your comment relative to cement shortages, part of what that has done is just put ready-mixed players in a position that as they get towards the end of a week, if they don't have significant powder in some markets, they're not buying stone either. Look, I think the fact is cement in some markets could stay tight for a while. And I think that could have from a bit of a logistics perspective, a little bit of a headwind. That's certainly what we've seen this year. it's not a massive headwind to be fair, Timna. I think part of what's happening this year is cement tightness has been an issue. Trucking has been an issue. Rail has been an issue. And I think some of the transportation and logistics issues while still confronting the industry broadly, are getting modestly better. So as we think about those issues going into next year, I would actually anticipate more logistics tailwinds next year than we've seen this year, and then we'll have to see how cement plays out. And keep in mind, Timna, in our world, the only place we have cement, and again, it's very much by design, is the strategic cement position that we have in Texas, where we're the largest producer of aggregates cement and ready-mixed concrete. So I hope that addresses the Mag issue and your thoughts around powder for next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Looking at the fourth quarter in aggregate volumes, the yearly number seems to indicate it's going to be negative. Is that correct? And other than weather is there anything going on within the quarter in aggregates?
Ward Nye: Yes. Keith, thank you for the question. The primary thing that we're looking at as we look at Q4 is severalfold. One, what's the year-to-date look like, two last year, it's worth remembering that we actually had a winner that didn't roll in until very late in the year. So we had a Q4 that was unusually long. So what we're doing in large measure is assuming that a normal winter shows up. And if a normal winter shows up and then we go back and augment it to varying degree some of those items that we were just talking about with Timna, saying what happens with normal winter. What happens if logistics constraints concur or recur and what happens if cement continues to be tight. We're just looking at those things and trying to sort out what we think that could mean for the fourth quarter. And really, your swing factor as much as I hate to say it, is going to end up being winter. There are a number of markets that can be really weather affected that are actually quite good markets today. Among them, for example, Indianapolis is a very attractive market. Minneapolis St. Paul, we're seeing asphalt volumes in that market where we're an FOB provider higher than they were last year. And by the way, we thought last year was a pretty good year. So if we end up with colder weather in some of these markets that are relatively high performing, it does have no pun intended, but chilling effect on what the volumes can look like for the rest of the year, Keith. So that's how we're racking it up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen. Ward, maybe you could remind us sort of what in your guidance for 2022, what was maybe the overall headwind towards the higher energy and materials cost or constraints, labor, however you want to place it? And as you're looking into 2023, certainly, it's certainly it can stay, the inflation stays at a high level, but what kind of moderation may we see and what are the parts that we could look for to help some of the tailwinds if we get this pricing agreement [Inaudible]
Ward Nye: Sure. Let me bifurcate that a little bit. Let me tell you what we saw. Jim will come back and give you a sense of what we're expecting. And so I'll try to break it down just a bit. So again, if we look at diesel cost per gallon and if we're looking at the aggregates business and the single largest energy input, that's what it is. So diesel cost per gallon was up 69%. And what that means is it was up from $2.44 a gallon in Q3 of 2021 to $4.12 a gallon in Q3 of '22. Now in fairness, that did show and Jim commented to this in his prepared remarks, that did show some sequential moderation from what had been $4.60 a gallon in Q2. But so those are pretty big numbers. And there are big numbers in particular when you keep in mind that for a full year, we're anticipating having about 53.5 million gallons of diesel fuel that we will use. Similarly, if we look at electricity and natural gas, and of course, these will be involved in the aggregates business. But in fairness, there are going to be bigger issues in cement and in Mag Specialties. So again, if we're looking at those, the electricity costs were up 46%, Nat gas was up 106% as we look at Q3. So those are pretty significant headwinds that we have during the quarter that I think we actually very successfully navigated. Now speaking a little bit at least on what we look for the rest of the year and into next year. Jim, I'll turn that over to you, if I May?
Jim Nickolas: Sure. So the energy cost for the full year headwind, we're expecting in 2022 is about $190 million or so, give or take, that's a full year view. At this point, we're not assuming those get better or worse next year. They stay elevated, but they don't improve, they don't get worse. So that's a big probably the most volatile of our cost components. Labor stays relatively well behaved. That's our biggest, single biggest cost component at about 20-ish percent. That's going to be maybe a little bit above average, but not too bad. What is growing of late, and I expect to continue into next year, supplies, repairs expense and contract services, those will grow a little bit faster as they have this quarter into next year. But I think all that said, our ASP growth should surpass that cost inflation in 2023.
Michael Dudas: Those are some stunning numbers, Ward. Well done.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: Yes, good morning, everyone. Congratulations on all the progress, Ward. I wanted to -- I just want to ask you about Texas cement. And you'd highlighted in response to -- your answer to an earlier question, just everything that's happened this year is kind of out of the ordinary, there's unplanned maintenance outages and we're down to low water on the river, import constraints, solar capacity everywhere. It's been a very, very tight year and an extraordinary pricing environment. But you're kicking off with a 20% increase for 2023 in response to a different question, you indicated you expected the inflection in infrastructure to be midyear, which suggests, I guess, absent something changing on the capacity side that there's another price increase coming mid-year. It just seems like a phenomenal setup in cement. So I'm just wondering, what are the risks, what -- is it resi? And could resi potentially be enough of an issue to be disruptive to all the growth in public and private nonres? Or just interested in how you're thinking about the downside to cement right now.
Ward Nye: No, look, I appreciate the question very much, David. I think cement as a general rule and cement in Texas as a specific rule are probably two different things. And I think part of what gives us such confidence in the Texas market overall is that it’s historically been the market place in which we've seen all the way through cycles, the single highest infrastructure percentage of our business. So when you're in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and you're going across concrete bridges. And I think that's a really important component to remember when you think about what's happening in that marketplace. The other thing that we've spoken of, David, is really what the requirements are in that state, what the in-state production is in that state and where our plants are located. So if housing slowed to a degree, would that open up some powder, the answer is it probably would. Does that mean that people aren't going to be faced with tightness towards the end of the week and might be able to take more aggregates I think it probably does. So I do think Texas is a very different and it's an overused word, David, but I do think cement in Texas is relatively unique. The other thing that I'll point out that I think has been a big help for us as we've looked at our business over time is the fact is as we look at our reliability and as we look overall at the utilization, of our plants in Texas. They continue on a year-over-year basis to get better. So we're finding ourselves in a position in a market that's very tight that making the shift to Type 1L is going to add capacity, adding the new finish mill at Midlothian is going to add capacity. And the fact is, we're a better cement company now than we were last year, and we're going to be better next year than we are this year. So I think there are a number of components to it. But I do think the commercial aspects of it will continue to be very attractive and right now we've got a lot of resilience around what we're anticipating for 2023 in cement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman: Hi, great. Thanks. Hey, Ward, if you guys get back within your target leverage range by year-end. Maybe if you could speak to your business development pipeline, overall appetite for M&A next year, a lot of internal focus here on margins in 2022 and obviously going into '23, a lot of the economic certainty out there. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about kind of the business development side.
Ward Nye: Brent, thank you for the question. I think that's such an important one as we go through cycles because our capital priorities are changing. And part of what I find really compelling about Martin Marietta is the ability of this company after having done the most significant cash outlays in its history in M&A last year to be de-levered exactly the way that we anticipated we would be by the end of this year. Now if we think about M&A more broadly, here's what I'll say. A lot of potential deals have come through our funnel in the last 18 months. And what we're trying to be is what you would expect. And that is very disciplined in what we're looking at. We're looking at a number of different potential transactions today. They tend to be almost exclusively. It's not tended to be, they're almost exclusively aggregates-based deals. And those are the types of transactions that we're most interested in. You hear the way that we speak of our business, aggregates-led, strategic cement, targeted downstream. So to the extent that we can continue to grow our aggregates-led business, that's what we're going to want to do. part of what's different now, though, as we think about it, Brent, is our footprint is different. So we have the ability to look in markets that we could not have looked in before to do bolt-on. And the reason that I called that out is bolt-on, if you think about them from a risk allocation perspective are actually very low because you've got operating people in that market, you've got commercial people in that market. Integration can broadly occur over the course of a weekend, and the execution risk is really quite low. So do we continue to look at M&A? The answer is yes. Do I hope that we'll have some things to talk to you about late this year or early next year? I hope so. There are certainly no guarantees on that, but the aim is that we will continue to do that, and you should look for it to continue to be aggregates led. So I hope that's responsive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on the nonresidential side. If you have an estimate of how much of your nonres shipments is going towards that heavy side of nonres, is expected to hold off as opposed to the light nonres? And just to be clear, on the nonres, are you seeing any current delays or cancellations? Or is your outlook there just more indicative of how this end market tends to follow the healthy cycle of the lag?
Ward Nye: Yes. Good to hear your voice, and thanks for the question. I'm going to take part two and ask Jim to come back and deal with part one. So part two, we're not seeing significant cancellations on nonres projects. And frankly, that's not a big surprise to me. The only time in my career that I can remember that we saw that happen in notable ways was coming out of basically that 2005, 2006 where building was so robust and the fall was so precipitous that we saw nonres projects actually stopping or being canceled. As a general rule, they don't they tend to go through. So the short answer is we're not seeing that. The other part of your question is really the breakdown of what's heavy and non et cetera. So I'll turn that over to Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So Garik, the heavy portion of nonres is 55%, the light portion is 45%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.
Michael Feniger: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. On the public side, you mentioned an inflection in the second half of next year. So is it fair to say that the growth rate in 2024 for public is likely to be higher than the growth rate in 2023? And just a follow-up on that. The industry has observed past cycles where you can get three consecutive years of double-digit pricing. You're doing it in 2022. Next year will be number two. So just -- if public is accelerating in 2024, the heavy side of nonres is okay, do we have underpinnings to get that third year for 2024? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Those are great questions, Michael. So thank you for that. Do I think we're likely to see that type of a build on the public side? The short answer is, yes, I think we probably are. Do I think we're in a position and again, look, this is really ranked speculation so I don't want to get out there too far. I think we've got a good sense of what pricing will be in 2023. And of course, we tried to capture that in what we put out in our preliminary guidance. If we're right, and I believe that we are, that we obviously have a multi-year highway bill. If we're right, that the U.S. is far from overbuilt, if we're right that anything relative to housing will not be deep, it will not be long, and if we're right that the U.S. is going to have to look at higher degrees in particular manufacturing going forward, I think you could take a number of economic indicators in that vein and say that volumes should be relatively attractive on a broader base for an extended period of time. What we've seen relative to pricing, particularly in aggregates is aggregate pricing tends to be attractive even in a challenged volume environment. If we end up finding ourselves in a multiyear circumstance, that you could have flat next year up year after or however you want to fashion it, I do think that you could continue to see a very constructive pricing environment. Now obviously, that's not guidance. That's looking out farther than we would typically look at. Obviously, what we've given you so far is a preliminary view of 2023. But if I'm just taking what has been more years around this industry than on occasion, I'd like to admit, I think what I've just outlined for you would be consistent with broader history.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Just a quick word on the residential side. Are you actually seeing weakness today? And I was just wondering if that has anything to do with the volumes down a little bit in Q4?
Ward Nye: I'm sorry, are we -- what today -- Adam, what is that?
Adam Thalhimer: Oh, actually seeing weakness in residential today? Or is that still something you just expect to see?
Ward Nye: You know what? In some markets, I wouldn't call it a weakness, I would see the slowdown. And I know that's parsing things a little bit. But overall, the reason that I don't say weakness is they're still in our markets such an acute need. And I think that's the fundamental difference that we're seeing today. So are we seeing a slowdown in large measure because of logistics constraints and otherwise? Yes. Are most of our markets, in my view, more affected today by lack of availability as opposed to affordability? I think that is the bigger issue, Adam. I'm not going to totally dismiss affordability in some circumstances. I mean, let's face it, as a practical matter, we've got a lot more people in the United States and we have interest rates trending up to things that would have looked relatively normal a decade plus ago. So we're going to have to see where that goes. But the short answer is yes, we are seeing some degree of a slowdown. Nothing that we think is dramatic. In fact, we think it's actually quite expected and what we're seeing more broadly. But I do think this is going to be a circumstance where very specific geographies will respond very differently, in particular on single-family housing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. It looks like CapEx guidance for the year was trimmed a little bit, maybe under $50 million at the midpoint, if I got that right. Can you just talk about what's driving that? And then any kind of implications for CapEx in '23 or maybe early thoughts on '23 CapEx, given you may be kind of flattish on volumes next year?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. It's Jim. Happy to take that question. The reduction in CapEx this year was simply just taking longer to get the money deployed than we had expected earlier in the year. There are no other reasons in the past, frankly. So it's just a reflection of what we think we can get done this year. As for next year, I typically guide focused about 9% of revenues. I think that holds true for next year. So sort of steady as she goes for us, and I would expect the same thing next year at about 9% of sales. Does that answer your question?
Anthony Pettinari: Yes. No, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.
Dillon Cumming: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to bring the discussion back to the supply chain logistics for a second. Ward, you were pretty clear that I think elements of like trucking and rail have been kind of constraining aggregates volumes this year. I think you alluded to the fact that those should be kind of improving modestly next year. If we think about the volume assumption that you have for the heavy side of nonres and public and infrastructure. So the '23 outlook of flattish volumes, are you still embedding that those kind of pockets of the end market spectrum are still constrained by those issues? Maybe the trucking and rail or how should we kind of frame up potential upside to that [Inaudible] conservative? And maybe if you start to see more pronounced like relief in those areas as the year progresses?
Ward Nye: Dillon, thank you for the question. The short answer is yes, we are assuming for purposes of next year that they continue to be constrained. We're assuming that degrees of constraints have been relieved but not at all wholly relieved. And keep in mind, we're going to benefit and we're going to have a burden depending on how things work, particularly relative to rail. As rail gets better, we're the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So we will be a disproportionate beneficiary as that circumstance is inevitably righted. At the same time, when it's struggling, we're going to feel it a bit more acutely, and that's where we've been over the last several quarters. So do we think it's going to be completely remedied next year? No. Do we think it's likely to be better? Yes. Do we see it getting better in the second half of this year than it was earlier? Yes. So that gives us a certain degree of resilience around our view on that next year. But that's how we're at least still and we're trying to frame that more broadly.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for any further remarks.
Ward Nye: Again, thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence, and remain focused on executing our strategic plan. Martin Marietta's track record of success throughout various business cycles and our ability to adapt to the various challenges inherent in the current macroeconomic environment proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model. We're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results with you in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I would now turn the call over to Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.
Jennifer Park: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, Q2 2022 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our second quarter operating performance, portfolio optimization efforts and end market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation, after which Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny, and welcome to Martin Marietta. And good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report the record results that Martin Marietta delivered in the second quarter, extending our strong track record of commercial excellence, profitable growth and disciplined execution of our strategic plan. In light of the challenging macroeconomic environment, including the rapid acceleration of key input costs, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus, ability to respond quickly and appropriately to changing dynamics and the resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our impressive results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also closed 2 previously announced downstream divestitures in the quarter. These transactions further enhance our company's margin profile, both near and long term while strengthening Martin Marietta's balance sheet and further improving the durability of our business through cycles. Our first half performance, coupled with these strategic divestitures, provide an even more attractive foundation for accelerated growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond. As highlighted in today's release we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the second quarter, a few specific examples include: consolidated total revenues increased 19% to $1.64 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $425 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $478 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.96. Our strong performance was due in large part to the diligent execution of our value over volume commercial strategy following the implementation of our April 1 price increases, widespread product demand across our coast-to-coast footprint and contributions from acquisitions. However, we were not immune to high input cost inflation, and as such, gross margins declined slightly. Notably, our teams are taking actions to mitigate the impacts of this historic inflation by implementing third quarter price increases broadly across products and geographies, which primarily take effect between July 1 and September 1. Additionally, we're advising customers of a fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets. We believe these commercial initiatives, together with other operational inflation management actions position Martin Marietta well to benefit in the near term from anticipated record second half pricing growth rates. Continued product demand, together with customer preference for material quality and availability, is expected to support an extended favorable pricing environment. We're well positioned to produce quality products, meeting this demand as a result of recent and ongoing capital investments as well as focused operational improvements at our key facilities. It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure a long after other inflationary pressures abate. While we typically invest in our business for growth, we also review the overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value through either monetizing or exchanging select assets where we may not be the best owners. Consistent with that approach, on April 1, we closed the sale of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete businesses to Suburban Ready Mix and on June 30, we completed the previously announced sale of our Reading cement plant, its related distribution terminals and certain California concrete operations to CalPortland Company. Together, these margin-accretive portfolio refinements enhance the overall durability of our business and provide Martin Marietta with the balance sheet flexibility to increase shareholder value by redeploying proceeds into future aggregates-led acquisitions. We're focused on continuing our organic growth improvements and initiatives while returning capital to shareholders and reducing our net leverage to within our targeted range. Let's now turn to our second quarter operating performance, starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregates demand across our 3 primary end markets, with total aggregate shipments, inclusive of acquisitions, increasing over 9% to a second quarter record of 57.8 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments increased 1.8% despite numerous supply chain and logistics issues governing the overall pace of construction activity. Additionally, in key Sunbelt markets, cement shortages negatively impacted our ready-mix concrete customers thereby, constraining aggregate shipments to that segment. Organic aggregates pricing increased 8.8% or 7.5% on a mix-adjusted basis, as our April 1 increase is built upon our first quarter pricing momentum based on high demand and increased costs. The Texas cement market is experiencing robust demand and tight supply. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record quarterly shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 14.7% as our $12 per ton increase went into effect on April 1. The market conditions in Texas, together with ongoing import challenges in Martin Marietta's core cement regions of Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, set the stage for further pricing actions this year, including a second $12 per ton price increase that was effective as of July 1. The outlook for Texas cement remains extremely attractive for the foreseeable future. Shifting to our downstream businesses. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 3.4%, reflecting strong product demand in the Texas Triangle, partially offset by the previously mentioned cement tightness. Organic pricing grew a robust 17%, reflecting multiple pricing actions, including fuel surcharges, which have passed through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments were effectively flat as strong demand in Denver was offset by a later-than-usual start to the construction season in Minneapolis, while organic pricing improved 17%, following the increase in raw materials costs, principally bitumen. Including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments increased 40%. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic operating environment and the impact on housing starts, inflation and interest rates, Martin Marietta continued to experience strong second quarter product demand across our geographic footprint. As we entered the third quarter, customer backlogs are firmly ahead of prior year levels with logistics challenges serving as the primary governor to the cadence of product shipments. As we examine each of the company's 3 primary end users, the combined outlook for continued aggregates demand is attractive as robust infrastructure funding and secular nonresidential demand trends are expected to more than offset any potential affordability-driven air pocket in today's historically underbuilt residential segment. With that backdrop, let's now turn to an end-use overview, starting with infrastructure. We're on the cusp of increased levels of infrastructure investment not seen in the United States since the introduction of the interstate highway system in 1956 as already healthy state Department of Transportation budgets receive incremental federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, allocations for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. As a result, we expect aggregates demand benefits will begin to accrue later this calendar year with a more pronounced expansion in 2023. Importantly, this increased investment in public works provides a base level of stable demand for our products for years to come. Similar to infrastructure, non-residential construction in Martin Marietta markets should continue to be an area of strength as pandemic impacted sectors, including like commercial, retail, hospitality and energy recover from their pandemic troughs and supply chain disruptions, lead businesses to establish manufacturing facilities closer to in demand. We've seen a notable acceleration and announcements of large aggregates intensive domestic manufacturing facilities. Some examples of these projects in our markets include: the Samsung semiconductor facility in Austin, the Stellantis Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix and the Vinfast electric vehicle site near Raleigh-Durham. Relative to pandemic accelerated growth sectors, warehouses and data centers are currently experiencing different impacts, starting with warehouses, consistent with Amazon's public announcement in April. We expect a moderation in their rapid square footage growth rate. However, we're continuing to shift to their end process projects. Importantly, though, we're experiencing an uptick in warehouse and cold storage construction from businesses other than Amazon as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and grocers adapt to a secular shift and consumers' preference for delivered goods. Additionally, data center demand remains robust, including meta data center projects in Kansas City and Atlanta, which were well positioned to serve from our nearby locations. With respect to the residential end use, location is always the essential factor. We've been purposeful and intentional in positioning our business in geographies where home prices are comparatively affordable and residential demand is far greater than supply due to a decade of underbuilding amid significant population inflows. As such, we expect the current housing slowdown to be: one, moderate in our key metropolitan areas as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium; and two, constructive for continued single-family community development in more affordable suburban areas.  As shown in our supplemental information slides, it's important to be mindful that even with June slowdown in housing, single-family housing starts remain at approximately $1 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, which, in our view, is a healthy level and supportive of continued aggregates demand to both the direct residential sector as well as the ancillary construction that suburban community development requires. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and provide some context for our updated full year guidance. Jim?
Jim Nickolas : Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. As noted in our earnings release, for our continuing operations, the Building Materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.45 billion, an 18.3% increase over last year and a second quarter product gross profit record of $401 million, an increase of 12.3%. All-time [record] aggregates gross profit of $309 million improved 13.2% relative to the prior year's quarter. Product gross margin declined 170 basis points to 32.3% as robust pricing growth was not quite enough to offset the inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, contract services and supplies expenses. Cement continues to deliver exceptional top and bottom-line results. Execution of a disciplined commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 140 basis points to 32.4% despite sizable energy cost headwinds and as well as unplanned kiln outages at both the Midlothian and Hunter plants. Domestic production capacity constraints are exacerbating and otherwise already sold-out Texas market, contributing to extremely tight supply and resulting in a marketplace that is on allocation. Importantly, we are taking steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. Those efforts resulted in setting an all-time quarterly record for cement shipments. In the short run, continued conversion of Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is creating incremental capacity for us. We expect between 25% and 30% of our historical Type 1 and Type 2 ship volumes to be converted to plc in the second half of this year. Many of you are aware, but it bears repeating that PLC is an innovative product that contains between 5% and 15% limestones and performs as well as standard cement, but with a lower carbon intensity. In the medium term, we expect to have our new Midlothian finish mill completed in late 2023, early 2024. This will provide 450,000 tons of much net incremental capacity to the Texas marketplace. As a reminder, our second quarter ready-mix concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1 and include the acquired Arizona operations, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. On an as-reported basis, ready-mix concrete revenues were down 15.8% as lower shipments due to the divestiture were partially offset by higher ASP. Gross profit declined $5 million to $14 million, and gross margin declined 80 basis points to 6.3% due to higher raw material and diesel costs. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability to the prior quarter. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions were not enough to offset the rapid increase in liquid asphalt raw material costs in the second quarter. As a result, gross profit declined $2 million to $26 million and gross profit margins declined 880 basis points. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from strong global demand for batteries as one of its chemicals line of products is used in cobalt extraction. This business generated record quarterly product revenues of $75 million, a 7% increase. However, due to the second quarter's rapid escalation in energy costs, gross margins contracted to a still impressive 34.6%. Higher energy costs are common then this quarter. However, we do not believe they will remain permanently elevated. If diesel fuel costs return to 2021 levels when West Texas intermediate crude sold for an average of $68 per barrel, our aggregates gross margin would expand by approximately 200 basis points. To be clear, we are forecasting diesel prices to remain flat with current levels for the rest of the year. However, we did want to provide context for the impact on margins when diesel costs ultimately subside. It is important to note that as indicated in our supplemental information slides, hopefully half of our aggregate pipeline costs have not increased at rates above historical trends. For example, personnel, depreciation and other expenses combined have remained generally in line with historical levels. While interest expense does not impact production costs, it does impact earnings. So I will briefly touch on that given the rapid rise in interest rates this year. In short, our borrowing costs are 100% fixed, eliminating direct exposure to rising interest rates. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $152 million of gain on the divestiture of the Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete operations. During the first half of the year, we returned $127 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We continue to anticipate a return to our target net leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x by year-end. Excluding the $152 million divestiture gain, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7x as of June 30. We remain diligent in the steadfast execution of our store priorities, focusing on allocating capital in a responsible, diligent and comprehensive manner to high-return initiatives that create value for shareholders. We plan to use the proceeds from our recently completed cement and concrete divestitures to further our long-standing capital allocation priorities. These include: prudently investing in value-enhancing aggregates-led acquisitions and organic growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders, all within the framework of maintaining a durable and resilient balance sheet. And as detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2020 guidance to reflect our first half results, expected second half pricing cadence as well as the overall macroeconomic operating environment as we anticipate continued inflationary pressure and volume constraints driven by continued supply chain and logistics challenges. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range $1.670 billion to $1.750 billion. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to capitalize on the strong product demand trends across our coast-to-coast geographic footprint as increased infrastructure investment, along with the recovery in light nonresidential construction, large-scale energy projects and domestic manufacturing is expected to largely insulate product shipments from any near-term affordability driven headwinds in residential end markets. Our team remains committed to the health and safety of our community, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Nice results in the quarter, especially given the cost headwinds. And I want to touch on the price acceleration in the quarter for both aggregates and cement, if we could, which is especially nice to see given the input and energy-related inflation that everybody is facing. And in your deck, Slide 4 implies that the pricing acceleration should strengthen even further in the back half of this year to a level I don't think I've seen in my career. So Ward, I want to ask if you could dive in a little deeper around the dynamics at play here and really what gives you confidence in this aggregates and cement price outlook for the back half? And also just what that could mean for profitability as we progress through the year and into '23?
Ward Nye: Trey, thank you for the question. Look, you're seeing something you haven't seen in your career and I am, too. And that is the way pricing is working is really just extraordinary. And party goes back to some of the commentary we discussed at the end of Q1, and that was we're seeing this in many respects as the best single commercial pricing environment that I think we've seen in a generation or 2. If we look at what's happened so far, and I think it does give you a nice build in the supplemental slides from Slide 4. We've seen very nice aggregates and cement pricing through Q2. We've seen broad midyear increases that have gone in. They've been implemented as of July 1. What we're seeing in July on those price increases looks very attractive. So to your point, what gives us confidence in this outlook? It's really seeing what we've seen so far in July, even building on what we've seen strongly throughout the year so far. What we anticipate is aggregates pricing here in the second half is going to be an exit rate that's really going to be at about 14.5%. I mean that's a really attractive number. We think cement can be -- it's something that feels more like 21.5%. So as we think about those exit rates, to your point, this year going into next year, it gives me 2 very base impressions: number one, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're going to have a record year; number two, as we go into next year, we're going to have what we anticipate to be another very attractive year. And the other thing that I think is worth noting, Trey, is a lot of what's driving pricing right now is clearly what's happening with energy. But as you know, having watched this space for a long time, energy tends to subside at some point. At the same time, heavy side upstream material pricing usually does not. So again, I think from an inflation management perspective, the team has done an extraordinary job, and I really appreciate your comments.
Operator: And the next question comes from Elliott Stanley with Stifel.
Elliott Stanley : Quick question for you. So the updated guide does take volumes down a touch in the second half. You mentioned volume constraints, logistics, was there anything else in there? And then maybe if you could kind of frame that, provide a little color on the backlog, which you mentioned were up on a year-over-year basis and just how we should think about that building into '23?
Ward Nye: No, happy to Stanley. Thank you for the question. I think several things are properly relevant. Number one, are contractors continuing to hire to the extent that they can? Yes. So is that a modest constraint that we see getting better? Sure. Is trucking still in some markets a constraint because of the availability of drivers? Absolutely. I think if you look at the overall public numbers from the railroads as well, it's getting better, but it hasn't been as fluid, I think, as they would have hoped. Here's something else though, that I think is really worth noting, and that is, in a lot of markets, cement is on allocation. So think about what that means as products roll through the process. If ready-mix producers can't get cement later in the week, the fact is they're not going to put down ready-mix concrete, which means they're not going to bring in aggregates. So the fact is that a really tight cement market in some markets can also have a bit of a governor on what overall aggregates growth looks like. So as we're looking at the back half of the year, those are some of the things that we've taken into account as we think about volumes. Now to your point, if we also try to consider what our customers' backlogs look like the customer backlogs are really quite good, and we're pretty heartened by that. What we're seeing right now is, overall in aggregates, the backlogs are about 9% ahead of where they were at prior year levels. So those are pretty heady numbers. What I like in particular is some of the wear on that. So if we look in the East division, which, as you know, is one of our very profitable divisions, that's up about 13% over where it was prior year. But here's one that's really notable, and that is in the Central division, now some of this is impacted by our acquisition of Tiller last year, but Central divisions up about 30%. And then even as we look at West Group, and again, you've heard the numbers on what's happening in the West, particularly in Texas, for example, in cement, that markets is sold out. We're basically seeing backlogs in that market broadly where they were prior year. And even in Southwest ready mix, we're seeing, again, backlog is very consistent, but bidding is remaining very strong. throughout the markets that are so core to us in DFW, Austin and San Antonio. So I hope that's responsive to your question on what we see on volumes and some of the why. But importantly, what we see on customer backlog and in summary, and what gives us that nice confidence as we look out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Gainey with Thompson Davis.
Kevin Gainey: Maybe I was going to see if you guys could touch on energy headwinds for '22 at maybe a high level? And then maybe discuss what you're thinking as far as the out years, what could happen with aggregate prices and as energy costs come down as such?
Ward Nye: Kevin, look, that's actually a great question and really nails much of what the story has been this year. So here's the quick take on that question. If we look at the full year, and take a look not just at the organic business, but the all-in business that we have, and we try to compare this year to last year relative to energy costs, the headline number is, we're going to have about $200 million of energy cost this year that we didn't have last year. So what I think is so important to do is to contextualize what I think has been superb performance by our team this year. We've got a $200 million headwind and we're talking about making $1.7 billion. So let's keep that in mind. Now to your point, I'm not going to prognosticate on when we're going to see energy start to subside. But if past is prologue, we're going to see that subside over time. To the other part of your question, we typically do not see average selling prices in these substream products, primarily, I'm saying aggregates and in cement, subside the way that we think we're going to see energy come down. So again, if we're taking that $200 million headwind and then back away and say, but ballpark, half of that ish is going to be what's happening in diesel fuel. Because, again, if we just take a look overall at what we're utilizing in diesel, we're going to be somewhere between 54 million and 55 million gallons of diesel fuel usage during the course of the year. So I think that at least sets the table on what the headline number is, how much of it's diesel. Obviously, there are going to be components of it that are natural gas and electricity. And by the way, every one of those is up pretty considerably from where they were in Q1 and our forecast takes that into account going forward. So I hope that helps.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.
Brian Biros: This is Brian Biros on for Kathryn. On infrastructure, clearly ramping up nicely in states from a project momentum standpoint. How are you managing inflation in this backdrop? And are you seeing any changes in bid activity?
Ward Nye: Brian, thank you for the question. Primarily, we're managing inflation in 2 different ways. I mean, you've seen what we're doing commercially to help manage inflation. The other thing that we're doing is making sure that we continue to strive for operational excellence to lower cost per ton in as many other ways as we possibly can. And we feel like the combination of those 2 things will likely lead to margin expansion, particularly beginning as we look at Q4 this year and into next year. As we look at the way DOTs are reacting, I think it's important to state, we're not seeing DOTs cancel any projects. I think on some occasions, we're seeing DOTs postponed some projects. And I think this is the notion. They're seeing very high, in particular, bitumen or liquid asphalt pricing. I think their hope is that they will see that pull back to some degree. I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is if you're looking at DOT pricing on projects that may have been done, what do we want to say, 6, 7, 8, 9 months ago, the fact is the cost input on projects today is so fundamentally different for contractors than it was during that time frame. It's not unusual for contractors to be coming in with numbers that are ahead of engineers' estimates. When that happens, that oftentimes dictates a rebidding anyway. So I think what we're seeing to a varying degree is in DOTs are being proactive, looking at numbers again, seeing what's realistic and then putting that out. Because I think part of what's important to keep in mind, Brian, is in the Martin Marietta states that have seen significant population inflows, legislatures and governors want to see this work go. So the fact is we're not seeing things canceled. We've seen in some places, things postponed. We think that actually plays out very nicely for us because as you see, we're more focused on value over volume anyway. And we think this actually plays out comfortably as we roll into '23 and the years after. So Brian, I hope that helps, too.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you can talk about the gross margin cadence for the aggregates line of business. It looks like based on the full year guide, you might be exiting the year, up 100, 200 basis points year-over-year and carrying that momentum into '23. Is that right? Can you just factor on that? And also just in the interest of setting expectations, for '23, consensus earnings estimates are looking for a 30% growth next year and a pretty mixed economic environment. So just in the interest of setting you up folks for success, as you said, initial '23 guidance in the coming quarters, any interest in commenting around moving pieces around '23.
Ward Nye: Jerry, thank you so much. And what I'll say is we will obviously give you much more color into '23 as we get closer to the end of this year. And obviously, when we get into February next year, we'll be very granular on it. I think, as we said, we certainly anticipate exiting the year at some very attractive exit rates relative to ASPs. We think we've got a -- we know we have a good handle on our cost profile. What I'll do is I'll turn to Jim to ask him to respond very specifically to some of your margin questions. So Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So yes, you're right, Jerry. We're looking at Q4 at a consolidated level being more profitable than prior year Q4. And that also applies, of course, to the aggregates business, which is the main business. Aggregates and cement, Q4 should continue the upward trajectory that we've seen, we expect to see. And at that point, we think they're outpacing cost inflation. Now again, that assumes we don't see a resumption of the rapid increases that we saw in the second quarter. We don't expect that to happen. So we think what we're forecasting will come to pass. And again, the ASP growth rate that we've projected will more than offset the cost growth that we're expecting as well. So by and large, yes, getting better each quarter here and out in Q4, in particular, will be meaningfully better than the prior Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] starting on for Anthony. When we think about the kind of light commercial work that generally follows 6 to 12 months after housing, if housing slows now, is there a potential for that commercial work that's currently [indiscernible] being interrupted? What do you expect that continue following, sort of asking another way, is this 6 to 12-month lag time the same on the down cycle as it is sort of on the up cycle? Or could that shorten?
Ward Nye: Thank you for the question. I'm going to answer the last part of it first, and that is typically the lag is about the same. In other words, if housing slows in markets, it would take several months, 6, 9, in some places, 12 for commercial to slow. Our view is we're really not seeing that. I mean, if we're looking at nonres in our markets, part of what we try to call out and you see it and the CEO commentary, among others. I outlined very specifically 5 different nonres projects that are relatively new, except for the 1 energy sector project that was called out that we see evolving. And again, those were Campo Commerce in South Carolina, Meta Data Center in Kansas City, the Samsung projects in Austin and the High Point Logistics Park in Aurora, Colorado. So what we're seeing in that dimension is actually quite attractive. There are 2 other things that I think are worth keeping in mind: number one, we're seeing the activity relative to chips that you saw come out of a relatively bipartisan vote in the Senate yesterday. If the house moves forward with that, that will clearly dictate more manufacturing here in the United States. I think much of that will likely occur in coastal areas where we tend to have a very attractive footprint. The other piece of it that I think is likely to be even more attractive, and this is more on heavy size than the line side is what we anticipate happening with energy. And I think energy can frankly be twofold: number one, we've long talked about those large LNG project pipeline projects that we see in South Texas and Louisiana. It's worth noting, as we've looked at those in the past, we've talked about the potential if those projects come to bear of around 13.5 million tons of aggregates that are tied to those different jobs and about 770,000 cubic yards of ready-mix. The updated numbers on those, to give you a sense of it, aggregates has gone from 13.5 million requirements to what looks like now it's closer to 19 million tons of requirements. The cubic yardage of ready-mix has gone from 770,000 to now 920,000. So again, I think nonres moves around a little bit. That's on energy in South Texas. Again, if some of these bills go through, and frankly, from a Martin Marietta perspective, if we see more wind energy in places like the Midwest, keep in mind, those tend to be very aggregates intensive jobs as well. So if we're looking at cold storage, if we're looking at warehousing, if we're looking at energy, if we're looking at degrees of more manufacturing in the United States, and we continue to have the population trends that we're seeing in Martin Marietta states of moment, meaning Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, et cetera. We think, number one, residential is going to stay very resilient for us. We think the white nonres that follows that is going to be good. And we think these components of heavy nonres can actually be very attractive, and there are also going to be very aggregates intensive.
Operator: And our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: My question is on natural gas. It's been on a quite a rollercoaster ride the last couple of months. If you could just talk about how quickly you feel that in your operations? Is it real time? Is there a lag? Unfortunately, I think maybe for more volatility in the next 3 or 4 months.
Ward Nye: Keith, thank you for the question. And look, energy has been all over the place you would imagine. And obviously, we're just looking broadly at energy. Obviously, we said we got a $200 million headwind this year. We said about half of that is really going to be attributable to diesel fuel. If we're looking at really how much we move things around on natural gas since the last time we looked to that. I'm going to ask Jim to come back and speak specifically to that because he can give you a sense of the volatility on that. Relative to natural gas, there's really not a lot of other hedging or otherwise that goes on in that. So it is relatively real time. But Jim, over to you.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So of the headwind -- the $200 million headwind this year versus last year, $100 million in diesels, it's worth mentioning $50 million is natural gas. So it's meaningful to our operations. To answer your question, it is the most volatile of the energy costs we've got right now. And I think our ability to react to it is similar to our diesel approach, we'll have to react to it in the form of higher pricing and there's a bit of a lag to that typically. It can be depending on the business anywhere from 3 to 6 months before we get that, that pricing reflected in the as we manage against those higher costs. So we're on it. We're kind of paying attention to it. It remains elevated volatility. So that's just a thing we're keeping an eye on.
Ward Nye: And Keith, just to put 1 more bit of data here. If we're looking at Q2 last year to Q2 this year and the increase on a percentage basis in nat gas, it's up about 66%. If we're looking at it more sequentially on where it was in Q1 versus where it was in Q2, up about 10%. So at least you're seeing a pullback in those percentage increases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane PNB Paribas.
Unidentified Analyst: This is George on the line for Paul. Changing tune a little bit. Do you mind just giving a bit of color on your decarbonization strategy for the 2 cement plants and maybe a bit of an indication of what that might cost? Clearly, in Europe, we've got a bit of a head start on CO2. So just wondering if you have any concerns that you might be a bit behind the curve there.
Ward Nye: George, thank you first for the question. I appreciate that very much. I guess several things that I would say. If you look at overall of what we've done relative to decarbonization, we've been looking at alternative fuels. We've been looking at that at both of our facilities, for example, if we look at the way that we're operating our plant in Midlothian, which is in North Texas, we're using tardive fuels for a good bit of that process right now. Overall, what's going to have to happen to really see significant decarbonization is we're going to have to see products and plans that can be used very broadly at a commercial level. I think if we actually look at the decarbonization of our plants and we go apples-to-apples, not apples to oranges relative to the performance that our plants have in the United States relative to most of the performance that we see from a carbon footprint perspective globally. I actually don't think we're behind on that. I think if you look at the sustainability report that we published in April, in which we went to great pains to outline what the different blending mechanisms can be and really how those scores are kept. I think you'll see that we're actually in a very, very good place. The other thing that's worth noting is if we go back in time and take a look at the capital that has gone into that strategic cement footprint that we have in Texas since 2014, we put about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. So what I think is fair to say is we've got a very attractive cement business in Texas. That is what we've been designed toward building as you'll see the margins in that business look and feel like the margins do in our aggregates business. That was part of our plan. And at least going forward, our ability to invest in that facility to utilize PLC cement, which Jim referenced in his prepared remarks, we think actually has us in a very attractive place. And we think we're going to be in a position to move as we need to: one, as a business; and two, is a very good community steward going forward to make sure that we can have the types of returns in that business that our shareholders expect and at the same time, make sure that we're the neighbor that people want us to be.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Phil Ng: I guess with recession fears dialing up here and the potential air pocket in housing, certainly healthy debate among investors how nonres would hold up next year. You've certainly highlighted some unique opportunities for Martin Marietta. Curious, how much line of sight do you have because that's a longer backlog business? And do you see some of these energy projects kind of start to kick in next year?
Ward Nye: Phil, thanks for the question. Good to hear your voice. And the short answer is we've actually got pretty good line of sight on the nonres. These tend to be particularly on these larger manufacturing type facilities, big jobs as a consequence of the size of the jobs. The owners are out, they are talking to generals and suppliers as well. Part of what we're seeing now is people are thinking about notices to proceed. They're giving us dates on when they think that's going to occur, that's occurring on a number of these large LNG project pipelines. It's also occurring on a number of those jobs that we outlined in the commentary that was published with our release today. I mean, part of what's striking to me is we look at some of these semiconductor facilities or others. I mean, these are enormous facilities, and we spoke not this past February, but the February before at Investor Day, how much size actually dictates more than dollars the aggregates intensity on these projects? So I think your point is a really good one and that is not all markets are going to be treated equally as we go through whatever the next several months maybe. And again, if we're simply looking at nonres and frankly, if we go through it on a stop light basis and go red, green, yellow, we're seeing a lot of green on nonres as we go through our top 6 states. And frankly, I'll tell you as I look at it today from a non-res perspective, they're all green right now.
Phil Ng: Okay. So if we kind of combine that with the momentum you're seeing on infrastructure in a moderate recession, do you think you have enough levers for volumes to be up next year for [indiscernible] and your Texas Cement business?
Ward Nye: Ask that question again, you said between the infrastructure and say it again. I didn't hear it, Phil.
Phil Ng: Just given what you're seeing in nonres and certainly infrastructure dialing up, in a moderate recession world, do you think you have enough levers for aggregates and cement to be off next year in a moderate type recession?
Ward Nye: Look, we'll obviously come out and give very detailed guidance on that at some point. But here's what I would say, Phil. Look, this infrastructure bill is up considerably. The states in which we operate are in a very good budget perspective. You've probably seen what I have, and that is states like North Carolina that are looking forward ahead are now in the latest budget that's been approved saying we're going to take a certain percentage of sales taxes and putting that to infrastructure. Obviously, if we're looking at population trends in our key states, the trends themselves have been quite attractive. I think what people are looking for, Phil, at the end of the day, is in a volatile time, what looks safe. And I think one of the things that this management team believes is that we have built a very durable business, a business that has the capacity and enough market to outperform and ability that as we go through cycles, we'll continue to outperform. And it's not just that we have a durable business. We built a durable business in markets that we think will outperform. So obviously, we'll give you more, but I'm trying to give you some data around what gives us such confidence going into next year, and we'll give you more detail as we get closer. But we're not seeing anything in '23. As we look at it broadly, that scares us right now.
Phil Ng: Yes, that's great. That's helpful. And certainly, a lot of carryover fraction going into next year as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: Ward, just maybe to build on the previous question, 2023, looking like it could be an awfully strong year. You bring in the state funding that you referenced a moment ago. You layer in on top of that the IIJ projects, which really should be building relatively well from a momentum standpoint in 2023. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, in the absence of some really deeply recessionary impact on the market, a very tight cement market is going to get even tighter. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of a constraint to aggregate shipments that might represent? And what percentage of your total aggregate flow would be influenced by a cement supply constraint?
Ward Nye: David, that's a great question. And I think you just saw it this quarter. I mean, I think it constrains it. I think it makes it modestly tighter. I don't think it does horribly shocking things to it. Because what happens, David, is different states are going to react very differently to a cement shortage. So here's a good way to think of it. Obviously, Texas is the big cement-producing state. It has a number of facilities there. We're the largest cement producer in Texas. If we come here to our backyard in North Carolina, there's not a cement plant to be found in the entire state because it's largely a granite state. And where we do have limestone that can meet the criteria that you would need with high calcium carbonate, it's going to be in the eastern part of the state, and it's going to be so difficult to access that you don't have a meaningful cement plan in the state. At the same time, we don't see concrete acting remarkably different here that is in places like Texas today. So again, David, I would call it more on the margin, it's going to be something that we might talk about and could slow it down to a degree. It's not going to be something that if I'm sitting where you are sitting or frankly, where I'm sitting, that I'm going to have a great degree of concern about in large measure because the work is not going to go away. The work is likely just to be pushed to the side. And one of the things that I think we recognize is in a circumstance in which materials can be tight, again, it's a very attractive commercial environment for us. So I don't think it's going to be horribly meaningful on the volume. It will be modestly. I think it's going to be more meaningful positively on the ASP.
Operator: And our final question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.
Michael Dudas : So Ward, could you maybe assess how your acquired properties and assets have been performing over the last -- during 2022? And maybe how you get a sense of how the California market is shaping up? And could that provide some stability or some upside on the nonres and cement front?
Ward Nye: Mike, thanks so much for that question. Happy to. So we'll break it really into 2 material buckets. Let's talk first about the Lehigh assets in the West. So we're not seeing anything that we've been surprised by, and that is these assets have substantial earnings growth and ASP potential that's frankly in the process of being unlocked. So what I would ask you to do is go back and reflect on the way, in many respects, the TXI came into the business and the way that it's performed since then. As you may recall, the single quickest wins that we saw in TXI was really relative to ASP. That's what we're seeing right now in California as well. January 1 price increases on aggregates were up double digit. July 1 midyear increases in large measure, $2 per ton across much of California. And you can also see that we're going through in a very orderly way in looking at the portfolio and making sure that we're keeping what's core to us, where we, in fact, are the best owners. So we're in the process of doing that. I think it's actually gone quite well. So we're not seeing anything in California or Arizona that's been a surprise to us. Frankly, on some days, I'm sure to wish I could get more cement in Arizona, but I will also concede that's a high-class problem in many respects. As we think about the Tiller assets, and as you recall, we bought those just modestly ahead of the Hanson assets last year. Part of what we really like about that business is very limited CapEx requirements in that business. So part of what we're seeing there, these assets are going to be some of the best in portfolio from a cash flow perspective. And we think that's likely to be the case for years to come. The other thing that's been attractive to us, and it's really helped us come back and make sure that we have the investment there that's going to be really attractive for us is Tiller had a good bit of reclaimed land that was available for sale of the transaction. And we've been in the process of monetizing that, frankly, faster than we would have thought at higher valuations than we would have thought. And basically, we're able to take a net purchase price reduction as we go through that. So as we're looking at a very nice operating business in Tiller, it's performing well. Obviously, it's a business that's largely in Minnesota. So as people saw this past year, don't expect much of that in January, February and March because, well, it's cold in Minnesota in January and February and March. But the business is doing quite well. Hansen is doing very predictably, and we feel very good about where that business will go. We've got a very capable management team that's overseeing it, and we continue to be excited about now what is a very meaningful coast-to-coast aggregates led footprint.
Michael Dudas : And this still is a beautiful state work.
Ward Nye: Thank you so much.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing comments.
Ward Nye: Thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence. We believe that [triumbrent] inevitably leads to superior results, and we're confident on Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2022 results in the late fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 14:45:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Martin Marietta's first-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A Q&A session will follow the company prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta 's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are C. Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results for financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  We undertake no obligation except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings which are available on both our own and the Securities Exchange Commission's website. We've made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, Q1 2022 Supplemental Information that summarizes our financial results in trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations.  In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the Supplemental Information, as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward and I will be in today's earnings call with a discussion of our first-quarter operating performance, portfolio optimization announcements, our updated full-year guidance, and market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I'll now turn the call over to Ward.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We are excited about Martin Marietta's opportunities for operational, safety and financial success in 2022 and beyond. We're off to a predictable start this year. And our company's prospects for attractive growth and value creation are outstanding. Public and private construction activity are set to expand concurrently for the first time since this industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005, supporting multi-year demand and pricing acceleration for our products.  Beyond the benefits of these notable industry dynamics and underlying market fundamentals. We're confident that continued disciplined execution of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR. Will allow for responsible and sustainable growth of our coast-to-coast footprint. As highlighted in today's release, we once again exceeded world-class safety metrics company-wide. That's an important distinction as this performance includes operations that are relatively new to Martin Marietta guardian angel culture.  We also achieved a new first-quarter record for consolidated total revenues, which increased 25% pricing gains ahead of more broadly planned April increases. Organic upstream shipment growth in 2021 acquisitions all helped drive this top-line improvement. Cost inflation, however, outpaced revenue growth, resulting in reduced first-quarter profitability and margins versus the prior-year quarter. This was expected. In fact, our guidance provided in February weighted increased profit contributions to the second half of 2022 versus historical patterns. The reasons we anticipated and articulated regarding the shift we're two-fold.  First, our annual price increases, which are some of the largest and Martin Marietta's recent history mostly become effective on April 1st, the benefit from which builds throughout the year. Second, our costs, including energy headwinds, were anticipated to be more pronounced earlier in the year since comparable periods in the previous year experienced relatively benign inflation. What was unexpected though, was the rapid escalation and energy prices and other cost inflation in recent months. Nonetheless, beyond achieved and yet to be realized annual price increases, we're confident that disciplined execution of our commercial and operational excellence initiatives will more than offset these inflationary headlines.  It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures moderate. Our teams are actively advising customers of mid-year pricing actions, which we anticipate will be widely accepted and more aggressive in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer-term, Martin Marietta is well-positioned to execute on our value over volume pricing strategy and benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly more favorable and extended pricing cycle.  Confidence in our near- and long-term outlook is further underpinned by the disciplined execution of our SOAR 2025 priorities. During the quarter, we continue to optimize and enhance our aggregate SLED portfolio. We completed the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mix concrete businesses to the nation's largest privately-owned concrete producer on April 1. We also recently entered into an agreement to sell our Redding cement plant, related cement distribution terminals, and 14 ready-mix concrete plants in California to CalPortland Company. We expect to complete this transaction in the second half of 2022.  Collectively, these portfolio optimization actions both strengthened the durability of our business through economic cycles and enhance our margin profile. We intend to deploy the proceeds from these sales to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, facilitating higher-return, external, and organic growth investments to further enhance shareholder value. Before discussing our updated for your guidance, let's level set first-quarter results relative to the rest of 2022. While profits were lower than last year's for the reasons just discussed, the key takeaway is that the first quarter does not represent the beginning of a price cost margin compression trend.  Rather, we believe it's the end of the margin compression dynamic for the company, the scale, frequency, and efficacy of our price increases provide us the confidence to forecast full-year margins for 2022 exceeding those of 2021. In short, we believe better than expected aggregates pricing realization and contributions from our newly acquired West Coast operations will offset the divested earnings and expected inflationary headwinds.  As a result, we've reiterated our full-year adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance of $1.75 billion. As pricing momentum continues to build during the spring construction season, we anticipate that further pricing upside is probable. Accordingly, we'll revisit our full-year guidance after the second quarter. Turning now to first-quarter operating performance for our upstream and downstream businesses, organic aggregate shipments increased to 2.5%, reflecting growing public and private demand at the onset of the construction season. Encouragingly, Infrastructure shipments increased 6%, the largest percentage increase we've seen in several years. Acquired operations contributed an additional 4 million tons. Underpinned by our value over volume strategy, organic aggregates pricing increased 6.5% or 4.6% on a mix adjusted basis and reflected improving long haul shipments from higher-priced distribution yards. All divisions contributed to this pricing growth. As the largest cement producer in Texas, we continue to benefit from tight supply and robust product demand.  Shipments exceeded 1 million tons and increased 10% setting a new first-quarter record. Cement pricing grew 12% from multiple actions taken in 2021 and the resurgence and demand for higher-priced specialty products. With a $12 per ton increase effective April 1 and our recently announced second round increase of an additional $12 per ton effective July 1, the Texas cement pricing outlook is extremely attractive. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments remained relatively flat despite the completion of several large and typically higher priced, portable projects.  Organic concrete pricing grew 8% following off cycle price increases and the implementation of fuel surcharges. Organic asphalt shipments decreased 3% as significant snowfall in January and February hindered Colorado construction activity. Organic asphalt pricing improved 6%. Looking beyond the first quarter, we remain confident that attractive market fundamentals and strong demand across our three primary end-use markets will drive aggregates-intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for Martin Marietta for the foreseeable future.  Enhanced infrastructure investments should drive aggregate shipments to this end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments. For reference aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 32% of first-quarter organic shipments. Department of Transportation budgets for our top states continue to be well funded through traditional revenue sources, as well as $10 billion dollars of COVID relief aid pushing estimated lettings nicely above prior levels.  Increased funding from the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, will further enhance the current strength of our state DOT programs, providing DOTs with increased visibility and certainty to advance their multitude of backlog projects. With full IIJA allocation available for 2023 DOT fiscal years, the majority of which began on July 1, we expect benefits to begin accruing in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. Non-residential construction, which drove 36% of Martin Marietta first-quarter aggregate shipments continues to benefit from the paradigm shift in consumer and work preferences and supply chains as evidenced by increased investment in aggregates intensive warehouses, data centers, and reassuring of manufacturing facilities to the United States.  Commercial and retail construction throughout our Sunbelt markets is expected to become more significant demand driver in 2022 as it's typically follows, single-family residential development with a 9-to-12-month lag. By way of example, Charlotte, North Carolina. On an office trends are returning to pre -pandemic levels with more than 2.6 million square feet of office space currently under construction in that area. The residential construction outlook remains strong despite rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, following more than a decade of historically bold new housing construction.  Expectations are that annual single-family housing starts remain in line with early 2000 levels over the next few years. That said the United States has added over 30 million people in the intervening period. Given our company's attractive footprint in destination metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction for the foreseeable future.  As a reminder, construction of single-family homes in subdivisions is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction. Given further, community build out of light non-residential and infrastructure. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 26% of our first-quarter organic shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our first-quarter financial results and liquidity, Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. And good morning, everyone. For our continuing operations. The building materials business posted record product services, revenues of $1.1% billion, a 26% increase from last year's prior quarter. And product gross profit of $137 million. Aggregate’s product gross margin of 14.9% declined 640 basis points. Product shipment and pricing growth was not enough to offset increased costs for diesel, internal freight, other production costs in depreciation, depletion, and amortization. As Ward indicated earlier, our Texas cement business is benefiting from growing demand and tight supply. Cement product gross margin expanded 630 basis points to 20.3% on a relatively favorable comparison. As a reminder, first-quarter 2021 was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies and incremental storm-related costs from the Texas deep-freeze. Partially offsetting this favorability were higher energy and raw materials costs in addition to a nearly $9 million increase in planned maintenance costs. Almost half of this year's planned killed outages, and other maintenance occurred in the first quarter. With that now behind us, we expect favorable comparisons for the next three quarters versus the prior year.  We are pleased to report that both our  and 100 cement plants begin accurately producing Portland-limestone cement or PLC during the quarter. PLC which relies on a limestone substitution of carbon intends clinker was not approved for use by the Texas Department of Transportation until recently. We now expect to ship roughly 425,000 tons of PLC this year. Importantly, in addition to the lower CO_2 emissions, the production of PLC versus traditional type 1 and 2 cement creates an 8% to 10% increase in annual cement production capacity. Importantly, no incremental capital spending is required as we ramp up PLC production.  Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 100 basis points to 7.3% as pricing gains did not fully offset higher costs for our materials, labor, and diesel. As a reminder, first-quarter financial results included the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1. Consistent with seasonal trends in our relevant geographies, minimal asphalt and paving activity occurs in the early months of the year. In fact, our Minnesota -based asphalt facilities, which we acquired in April 2021, were inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. In line with our expectations, the asphalt and  business posted a $13 million gross loss for the first quarter. Magnesia Specialties achieved record first-quarter product revenues of $71 million, an 8.5% increase driven by global demand for Magnesia based chemicals products. Despite top-line growth, product gross profit decreased 6% due to higher cost for energy supplies and raw materials, resulting in a 570 basis points decline in product gross margin to 37.8%. We remain focused on the discipline execution of SOAR to responsibly grow our business and deploy capital in a manner that preserves our financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. As Ward indicated earlier, we plan to use the proceeds for recently announced divestitures to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, which are focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic investments in returning cash to shareholders through both a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and our share repurchase program while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. We continue to expect full-year capital spending of $525 million to $550 million as we prioritize high-return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion.  During the quarter, we returned $89 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share buybacks, while we repurchased nearly 131,000 shares of common stock at average price of $383 per share, we continue to anticipate a return to our target leverage ratio of 2-2.5 times by the end of the year. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times as of March 31st. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.
C. Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well-positioned to capitalize on Infrastructure tailwinds, and strong private demand across our differentiated coast-to-coast geographic footprint. Looking ahead, we expect this increasing demand environment to drive multiyear shipment growth and attractive pricing for our products. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety.  Commercial and operational excellence. Sustainable business practices, and the execution of our store of 2020 -- 25 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates lead public company. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. . In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can get to everyone in the queue. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens, your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Hey good morning. Morning Ward, Jim and Suzanne.
C. Howard Nye: That's right.
Trey Grooms: So, Ward, you mentioned earlier having a predictable start to the year thus far. If you could go into a little more detail on what you meant there and then with that, what gives you the confidence to raise the guidance at this point in the year, notwithstanding divestitures, maybe if you could go into more color on how higher pricing and then the performance of recently acquired operations are playing into this confidence.
C. Howard Nye: I'm happy to, Trey, to answer the question. I guess a couple of things. First, we are actually comfortably ahead of plan right now. So that's part of what we think is not yet predictable about us because where we're sitting, where we're not in a whole, we're actually ahead of where we thought we would be. As you know, the first quarter is never a big quarter for volumes, so small percentages can -- or small numbers can make for big percentage in the first quarter.  Part of what I think from my perspective was predictable is we didn't have tiller last year in the first quarter. Obviously, that's a Minnesota base business and you're not going to put down a lot of asphalt in Minnesota in January, February, and March. The other thing that support, and Jim outlined it in his commentary as well, we actually accelerated some of the maintenance on the kilns in Texas this year. So, we're about halfway through with dollars, or more than halfway through with dollars that we're going to have on that. So, I think both those are important. Obviously, we did see degrees of inflation. But the other thing that we've seen, and I think this is to your point, Trey, on what gives us confidence to actually take our guidance up a bit, is what we're seeing commercially relative to pricing. We -- obviously, you're seeing price increases go in in April. We would not take up the guidance unless we were seeing what was happening in April and had a high degree of confidence in that. The other thing, Trey, that I think is different about right now, but in some respects, predictable is what we're seeing relative to mid-year price increases as well. So, number 1, the April price increases have come into where that we thought.  Number 2, we're looking at much more widespread mid-year price increases across our footprint than we've seen in a while. As you recall, last year when we did that, we talked about targeted mid-year price increases. This year we're talking about widespread. In other words, if we're not going to have a mid-year, that's going to be the exception this year. And we're also seeing that in scope from a dollar a ton the $5 dollar a ton depending on market, depending on product, etc. Part of what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a fundamental shift, customers are considerably more concerned today about getting product than they are relative to price.  So again, an attractive place for us to be if we're talking about timing of mid years. It's probably they're going to come in somewhere between July 1, in most markets as late as September 1, and others. But I mean, to give you a sense of it, this goes at least back to a part of your question relative to the acquired operations. If we're looking to price increases that we're looking at in California right now, we're looking at $2 a ton that's going to be effective mid-year July 1.  And again, that represents a double-digit percentage increase versus the January 1 ASP. So, you're seeing that nice building effect in that market. Even if we go to a heritage market and look at Central Texas, what we're talking to customers about very candidly there is a 10% increase in July 1 across-the-board at locations and on products. Still as we're looking at where we sit relative to the new acquisitions, if we're looking at the investments that we've made, the  business here at first quarter.  And we're looking at the overall price increases and we're looking at the fact that despite the inflation that we saw in Q1, we're comfortably ahead of plan, that gives you a sense of it was predictable about about it, but hopefully it gives you a sense of where we are in areas that gives us the confidence to take the guidance up.
Trey Grooms: Yeah. That all makes sense to me and very encouraging, especially on the pricing front. Thanks for the color, Ward, I'll pass it on.
C. Howard Nye: Thanks Trey. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research, your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. I'd like to focus a little bit more on the outlook from a customer perspective. What are your backlog looking like from each of the main end markets, res non-res in public? And touching on tight availability, it's pretty much at full utilization and taxes and still running short on products like TREXIMET, which has effectively stopped that. You can also see how we're going to manage, there's demand and aggregate demand in light of what you have a backlog. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye: Kathryn, to answer the question, I guess several things. One, if we just look at customer backlog, and that's important to think about, the best way we speak to it, if we're looking at aggregates, then it gets up about 11% year-over-year. So again, a very attractive number. If we're looking at cement to your point, it's basically sold out. If we're looking at Magnesia Specialties, chemicals has a record backlog right now. The customer backlogs look very, very attractive to us now.  Equally, if we look at downstream or the different end uses, obviously, we looked at Texas, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, those are our leading states. But here's the high-class dilemma that we have. We're looking at FY22 loadings in Texas, the TxDOT up $10 billion as the highest in five years. If you look at Colorado DOT, as you recall, Kathryn, they passed a 10-year infrastructure bill with $5.3 billion tied up in that. If we're looking at North Carolina, obviously, we're looking to recently passed date by any in budget, it's got a $4.2 billion number for FY22, and it's going up 17 -- where it's up 17% over where it was and it's going to be higher for '23.  This is my way of saying state budgets are very good. Our ability to put the product on the ground to meet the customer's needs is there. So we are not concerned about meeting their needs. What I think is also important, though, is trying to address in my comments around non-res. We're seeing more office building taking place. We're seeing more  taking place. And I think a lot of that is driven by where we have built our business.  And again, you've heard us speak for a while that where you are in this industry matters a great deal. So if we're looking at reshoring, whether it's Toyota come into  us. We now have Vietnamese car manufacturing in North Carolina. We're looking at Samsung north of Austin. These sorts of large, significant commercial projects. But I also think to comment that I gave you in my prepared remarks around office and retail and what we're seeing in markets on Charlotte is important.  But again, trying to close up at least in part, but I'm saying relative to end markets, we continue to see even on the residential side, underdog conditions, and we continue to see very attractive population inflow into our markets. I think some different states, not Martin Marietta states, may see some degree of push back as mortgages move. We're not seeing that and the fact is mortgage rates are up 200 basis points. This versus the prior-year quarter. But as we go back and even look at that, there's no correlation between mortgage rates in single-family starts over the past four years.  So, but I've tried to do in response to your question, just give you a snapshot of. What is it look like at the state level relative to Infrastructure? What we're seeing in non-res book on light and heavy size. And keep in mind, on the heavy side of that, we believe we're going to see increasing LNG activity in south Texas, but quite is already better. And again, residential in our states with very high population inflows looks good. Part of what we've done, Kathryn, as you know, is our capital allocation priorities through cycles has had us in a position that we've added capacity or efficiencies where we needed to and we're in a position to date to meet customer demands and their needs.  At the same time, we recognize we have a very valuable product in the ground and we're going stick with our value over volume philosophy. I think the way all of that is going to coalesce. We will have the product, we meet the customer's needs, and we'll create enduring value for our stakeholders as well. So, Kathryn, I hope that helps.
Kathryn Thompson: Yes, it is. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, could you dig a little bit more into commercial environment that you're dealing with right now? I know you guys have made a lot of investments there. And I'm really just trying to get a sense historically when conditions are good, the larger players tend to outperform, face some of the smaller regional players. I'm curious if you could tie that into the pricing comments, the investments that you made on your discussed on the previous question.
C. Howard Nye: Stanley, happy to -- good to hear your voice and thank you for the question. Part of what I think is helping us commercially, Stanley, is where we are. And if we go back, the states that I was listing through when we look at the states that are most important to us from a revenue perspective, these were attractive places to be. I mean being in Texas today, being in Colorado, being in California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where population trends are very powerful, helps us. Having leading positions in those states helps us as well. I think to your point, if we go back and look at the investments we've made, whether it's in North Carolina, or Texas or Colorado or someplace else, as markets get tighter and customers need product, we're clearly going to be in the position to do that.  Part of what we're seeing in some circumstances today is customers have gone up for quotes and the suppliers are unable to meet those requirements at this time, we end up having the ability to come back and at times fill orders that we did not get into first instance because we are very consistent with a value over volume philosophy. And again, we're unapologetic about that, so I think several things. One, it's about the location, Stanley.  Two, it is about the philosophy that we bring to it and three it does go back to the capital allocation priorities that we've had and you've heard us long say that our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. Our next best dollar spent is on internal projects because if we're in the process of making the rocks at Big Rocks were also going to destroy iron. And we want to make sure we keep these sites well-funded, very safe, very efficient, and able to meet market demands, but also flex as demands change. And so far, we've been in a position to do that through a great recession and now through this expansion that were in, so I hope that helps Stanley.
Stanley Elliott: It sure does, thanks so much and best of luck.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that your guidance is back-half-weighted for aggregates gross margins. But given the magnitude of price increases you're putting through in January and April, how should we think about, I guess, 2Q gross margins and aggregates? Would we still expect that to be down compared to the prior-year period? And maybe just help frame the type of margin expansion in the slope of the recovery in the second half of the year.
C. Howard Nye: Sure. Let me turn that to Jim and he can walk you through that place.
Jim Nickolas: As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So, with that in mind, I'll give you the broad-brush strokes. Q2 should be relatively in line with history, but I think the acceleration we're going to see is more pronounced in Q3 and Q4. The reasons are twofold, 1. The compounding cascading, if that's the price increases as obviously a greater effect in the longer you go into the year. But what's also may not be appreciated is the cost base, the inflation of that should moderate as the year goes on, two elements. The oil, the energy inflation, we're assuming for guidance purposes, it remains where it's at.  We don't see a reduction in oil for fuel prices. We're assuming for guidance purposes; they remain at their elevated levels. They don't come down. So, we've built that in. Now that said, last year's corresponding quarters saw increasing costs. So, on a year-over-year basis, we'll see improvement there. The other element is our DD&A is a higher percentage of sales in Q1 than typical because of the acquisitions, but meaningfully that will not increase. That's pretty much a fixed cost.  So Q2, Q3, Q4, that element will be fixed and relatively flat helping the margin expansion in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So, we'll get back, we're going to see the record or near record margins in the back half of the year on the aggregate side for those reasons. Does that answer your question, Garik?
Garik Shmois: Thank you very much
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer, with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. What I wanted to ask your zero on the mid-year price increases. And my question would be, do you think this will be a structural shift in the industry or do you think this is a one-off due to the high inflation just in 2022.
C. Howard Nye: Well, look, you know what I've always said. There are very few things in your life that you want that you can buy for $16 a ton except our profit. And to put a spec product on the ground and  for that is I think something is pretty special. Do you think if we go over time and look at the durability of aggregates pricing, one thing that it has shown is that it does have the ability through cycles to continue to move up into the right even at down cycles? I think you've got two things right now, Adam. I think you've got the demand environment that's attractive, that slightly stay attractive. I think you -- layer on top of that demand attractive, that is mighty in some very specific states where we could purposefully build our business.  And I think when you take those things together with inflation, I think you do have something that is going to be more profound for a period of time, certainly than it has been over the last several years in a marketplace that has either been flat or in some instances down in volume. So, it -- from where I'm sitting, Adam, this is the single most attractive commercial moment during my time as CEO of Martin Marietta.  So, in a 12-year period, I haven't seen anything that looks more attractive than this does. And obviously, we'll talk more about '23 as we get closer to it next year. But keeping in mind, we're not going to feel meaningful input from the IIJA in this calendar year. You're going to start to see that next year there's nothing in what we're seeing that doesn't give me a sense that we're going to be in a very attractive aggregates pricing cycle for a period of years.
Adam Thalhimer: Thank you Ward.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from  with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Philip Edwards: Hey, guys, Ward, I guess at this point maybe you have a little more line of sight in terms of the lettings associated with the infrastructure built. So, kind of be helpful, kind of help us think of the cadence of that ramp next year in 2023is it gonna be front-end loaded. In the first year and kind of kicks in pretty meaningfully or is it going a little more gradual nature? And it's been a while since you talked about these LNG projects, certainly with your oil prices are right now. That's a pretty robust backdrop. Help us understand that potential contribution in an overall your ability to kind of supply that demand potentially coming through.
C. Howard Nye: And I'm happy to full. Thanks for the question. So, look, you go back over time and think about what we put on the ground back in 2005, 2006, we put 205 million tons in the ground back in 2005. We've added, let's call it 40 million - ish tons or more of capacity since then. And as you can see, we were modestly over 200 million tons last year. That's my way of saying, as we see this ramp up, we can meet whatever is going to be required. Number 2, if we think about cadence, so I would say several things. One, please remember there's about $10 billion of COVID relief aid that you're going to see going into the flow this year.  So, I think that's going to be helpful relative to cadence, particularly in the back half of the year. The other thing to keep in mind from last year is there were about $7 billion in new vote or approved initiatives that were passed last November, and about 4.5 of that was in Texas all by itself. So, what I would say to you is here at half 2 this year, we're going to start feeling I would say a bit of IIJA. We're going to feel the considerable amount of the $10 billion. We're going to start to feel portions of that $7 billion as we roll into 2023.  Typically, if we think about the way a highway bill rolls out, in Year 1, you're going to see about 20% to 25% spot. so that's going to be in '23. In Year 2, it tends to be around 40%, so again, that's going to be and '24. And then the balance of it over the following years. So, it's a practical matter if we're really looking at '23, '24, '25, '26, and '27. Those are going to be the IIJA impacted years and I think that's likely to be the type of roll out that we're going to see, and I think remembering that that's going to be augmented by what we've seen in COVID relief funds together with the voter approved initiatives, is the right way to think of it. So hopefully those percentages at least gave you some direction on that as well.
Philip Edwards: Anything on the LNG side. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye: So, I'm sorry about that. Look, what we're seeing on LNG side is several folds. One, as you recall, field there are several large projects in south Texas that combined have about 13.5 million tons of stone that can be required. Right now, we've got generally one of those jobs we've actually seen a change order on that. That's what the Golden Pass job. So, we're actively involved in that. The fact is whether it's Port Arthur, Rio Grande, Chevron Phillips or Schneier a number of those either have final bids that are going in or there and the processes sorting out exactly where they're going to be.  We believe with energy prices at an elevated level, we are likely to see continued activity there. The other thing that we're seeing it again, I'm sure this is not surprised to is we're seeing more wind activity across the United States. We're also seeing more solar activity across the United States. So, energy is likely going to be an area that we will continue to see activity ramp up. Up in competency at least two different wind farms that are looking for product right now. So, I think between LNG, wind farms and solar, all of which are more aggregates and sensitive than you might otherwise believe. That's going to be a pretty attractive end-use for us for a while with a lot of potential times.
Philip Edwards: Thank you Ward, real exciting times.
C. Howard Nye: Thanks, Phillip. Agreed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research, your line is open.
C. Howard Nye: Michael, we don't hear you. We're not sure if you're on mute or not there.
Michael Dudas: Yes.
C. Howard Nye: There you are.
Michael Dudas: My fat finger got in the way. I'm sorry about that.
C. Howard Nye: It can happen.
Michael Dudas: Good morning. Well, I just wonder if like maybe you could share some further observations on what you're seeing from your new acquisitions out in the West Coast. You've gone through some portfolio optimization studies. Are there any other, assuming they are ongoing, but is there any others that are immaterial that we might think about throughout the organization that we might see more in 2022?
C. Howard Nye: Let's start first with what we've done, what we brought in. And I would say they are all performing at or better than we would've thought. If we look at the Lehigh transaction, California, again, it's ahead of internal expectations after Q1 and by that, I mean on volume, on price, on EBITDA. These assets, we believe have substantial earnings growth and aspects people,  that's in the process of being unlocked. We're talking with our new teammates on the way that we'd like to think about the way running one of those businesses looks like. We talked about the fact that we've successfully put in attractive January 1 increases for all product lines and California.  I think also mentioned that we've got mid-years coming in in that marketplace as well. Again, that's gonna to be around $2 a ton in California. So again, we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. Tiller has been a wonderful acquisition for us as well. Keep in mind in Q1, Tiller is not going to do much because Minnesota just doesn't have that much going on.  But if we look at what we've seen in that business, Number 1, it's a very good business when we bought it. Number 2, we think it's going to be one of the best in class and what Marietta relative to cash flow conversion, we think it's going to be that way for generations to come. It's got very attractive aggregates business, but it also has a very attractive hot mix business and marketplace in which Minnesota has a very aggressive Department of Transportation budget. The other thing that's been important to us there, and it's been a very nice value-add, is some of the excess properties that we've been able to sell that have come out of that business as well. So all-in-all as we're mining there, a lot of it sand and gravel and we're reclaiming property and turning it into very attractive commercial operations or pads going forward, that's been a very attractive business for us.  So, I would tell you that there's been nothing in the major transactions that we did last year that has in any respect been a disappointment. In fact, they've all exceeded what we would have believe. Relative to the optimization, as you would imagine, part of what we've been focused on is what we've long said we are and that it's we are an aggregates led company. At the same time, if we look at the portfolio that we have, I will tell you very candidly, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have.  So, I wouldn't be looking for enormous changes in that portfolio, but you'll also see with the shifts that we've made and the sale of the ready-mix business in Colorado and Central Texas that we've done, if you look at the initial portfolio breakdown on product line contributions on what it look like before that transact and what it looked like after that transaction, obviously, the aggregates lead portion of it went up fairly notably. And what you'll also see is that we're looking for about a 120 basis points of margin improvement with what we've done relative to the portfolio as well. What you and I know is. Different markets are built differently and some markets you need to be vertically integrated in some markets you don't. Obviously, if we think about the business that we have in Texas, we're the largest aggregates player with the largest  player and the largest ready-mix player. And we think that's an important way to face the market. Equally, if we look at the business that we have in Arizona today, the ready-mix business that we have in Arizona is a very, very attractive ready-mix business.  So, part of what we've done over a period of nearly 30 years now is trying to be very purposeful in where we have built our portfolios, how we built it and what the products are. And we believe with what we've already done and what we had pending right now relative to the sale of Redding in Northern California, the ready-mix in California. And then the preferred transaction that we have with CalPortland relative to . It's a lot of moving parts, but we think it's all value additive moving parts.
MichaelDudas: Excellent work. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you so much. Mark.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes: Thanks, Nick, question on PLC could you describe earlier a couple of things on that, do that sell at a higher sales price of the customer than just traditional cement and you have a feel for how big a business could be, how well is it accepted in the specific the Texas markets?
C. Howard Nye: Look, thanks for the question on that. So, a couple of things. 1. It doesn't sell for anything that's markedly higher. Part of what is happening with it, Keith, is different departments of transportation have gone about the process of either approving it or not approving it on different timelines. So, it -- frankly, it's now allowed by TxDOT. The short answer is it performs very similar to type one and type two cement, it certainly helps us, Jim outlined with incremental capacity.  It does lower raw material costs and it puts you in a position that you can use less carbon intensive clinker over time as well, so they are just a series of components to it that from a cost input perspective, from an environmental perspective, and the capacity perspective that end up being actually very attractive. And as you know, Keith, we're cement producer in Texas and cement is very tight in Texas. So, from a timing perspective, this is very, very helpful because obviously FM7, which we will add, will bring significant efficiency to that business.  We'll obviously get some other components from those efficiencies that we believe might help, meaning the volume of that market more, combining that with what we see in PLC. That's a very attractive trifecta in a marketplace that seeing increasing pricing right now.
Keith Hughes: Okay great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Keith.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: Yeah, hey, good morning. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye: Hi Timna.
Timna Tanners: Wanted to just explore the cement shortage discussion a little bit more. And what alleviates that, if there needs to be incremental capacity or if this is just a logistic shortage, there's been a little bit of imports from Mexico and I just wanted to get a little bit more of your perspective about how that plays out. If this is a true shortage or if it's just about labor and logistics or -- your thoughts that'll be great.
C. Howard Nye: Timna, thank you for the question and the fact is, I think it's going to be -- well, it's real. It's tight. Two, I think it's going to stay tight for a while. If we go and look at the reports that come out from the comptroller, I mean what you will see is Martin Marietta's market share. And again, this is really tied to this conversation that you and I are having, is usually around 20% in that marketplace. We see that move around a little bit. To your point, imported cement has seen its share move around overtime as well.  Historically, imported cement in Texas has been 10-12%. I think the most recent numbers I have seen, has it modestly over 17%. So that gives you a pretty good sense of that's what's having to happen as we speak to make sure that the market is actually fed. I think part of what happens in Texas too, Timna if you think about it, when you're riding in New York, you're riding on asphalt roads. When you're riding in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and part of the reason I mentioned that is infrastructure has always been one of the higher percentages in Texas of the downstream markets that we have. We think it's going to continue to be that way.  At the same time, if we're looking at the non-residential projects that are underway in that marketplace, day 2 tend to be relatively concrete intensive because they are structural in nature. So, it's a tight yes. Are we actually going to add efficiencies and as I mentioned before, have a byproduct of what we think might be capacity to FMS 7? The answer is yes. Do I think PLC Summit that helps in that marketplace, I think that answer equally is yes. But here's something to keep in mind some West Texas with the energy sector having been where it's been over the last several years, has not been particularly  it we're seeing that market come back right now.  That's some more attractive pricing in state. And at the same time, adding capacity is number one very expensive, and number two regulatorily quite challenging. So that's my way of saying it is tight, it's not manufacturer tied, it's not a labor tight is just tight, and I think it's likely to that way for a while, so I hope that helps Timna.
Timna Tanners: So, between energy and infrastructure still on the calm, there's, there's even more demand around the corner and not a lot of new supply, is that fair.
C. Howard Nye: It feels like Texas is a good place to be. I think that's right.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor, with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David Macgregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone, and Ward, good morning. It's nice to hear your characterization of the aggregates market. Right now, it's the most commercially encouraging you've seen are the best moment you've seen the best 12 years. I think that says a lot. I guess my question was with respect to the mid-year price increases and I'm just thinking back over the years, mid-year price increases always had a limited second-half benefit. But certainly, an important compounding benefits of this subsequent year. Is there anything different this year with respect to how we would phase in those mid-year price increases, maybe your ability to price backlog so maybe there's escalators in that business now that hadn't been there in the past? But I'm just wondering if there's anything different this year with respect to that phasing.
C. Howard Nye: Yeah, I think volume is clearly going to be growing in the back half of the year and is going to be growing into next year. So, I'll say two things, David, if you think about the ASP increases that we've already seen in Q1 had a major price increases that we're putting it on April 1. Our  start thinking about this year's mid-term, mid-years in that way, as we think about next year. As a general rule and they're always exceptions to general rules as you know, as a general rule you'll recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase in the year in which you put it, because you're protecting customers on volume that you've already committed to them.  Now, to the extent that they're going through product more quickly this year, you might recognize more. I think the primary thing that I would say relative to the mid-years, David, in fact, in my commentary, but it's the most attractive commercial market that I've seen as CEO. It's simply going to be width, breadth and amount of them. I just think we're in a place that we will see more of them at higher dollars than we've seen for a while. As I think I indicated early on, we're seeing good years that could be anywhere from a dollar a ton to $5 a ton, depending on product and market FX. And it's been long time since you and I've had that type of . 
David Macgregor: 
C. Howard Nye: Thanks so much, David.
Operator: Thank you we have a question from Courtney Yakavonis, with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Courtney Yakavonis: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wondering. Obviously, very exciting to see the increase to pricing in the guidance, but you didn't change your volume outlook and I believe this is primarily due to that tight market and largely logistic constraints. Can you help us understand if you are starting to see any softness? Obviously, we're seeing freight rates come down. And then similarly just on the job site, if there's any improvement in some of the  supply chain constraints that we've been seeing is it still too early to call at this point.
C. Howard Nye: It's a great question and, Savvy, I do think it's too early to call right now. A lot of the same constraints that we're seeing last year we continue to see right now. I will tell you at least from supply chain to us relative to our own internal capital projects. We're not seeing big issues there in large measure of our supply chain is a domestic supply chain instead of international. But I do believe we're going to be faced with for a while the same labor issues for contractors, though I think that is getting better.  I think transportation will continue to be constrained for a while. The other thing that Jim mentioned, it's not so much a supply issue, it as a cost issue. We did go back and adjust basically where we had our fuel for the rest of the year. We came into the year as I think Jim has mentioned with about a $25 million headwind on fuel, we're assuming it's going to stay there. So actually, in the guidance that we've given you, we've assumed that there's about $75 million headwind on that. So, I wanted to make sure our spoke to you about that headwind as well as what we're seeing overall in supply chain, but I think the short answer is, Courtney, it's still too early to note for sure.
Courtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman: Hey, great. Thank you. Hey, Ward, I think you mentioned in a couple of occasions on this call how critical and is for the customers to get the product as quickly as in this environment today, I've heard that from others as well. Are you you needing to make incremental investments at your sites to support that or is this just a situation we're scaling proximity? You could be a leg-up right now.
C. Howard Nye: Brent, it's a great question. And I think it's still latter. I think it's fortunate that we've been in a position that as we've gone through cycles with, we've been able to very consistently invest in our business. We've never had to pull back on the CapEx stick for such an extended period of time at such a low base that we've done intrinsic harm to the business. And in fact, if you go back overtime and you see where we've been, we've largely been around 9% of revenues relative to our CapEx and we've been consistent on what we're doing inside our business.  So, I do think that puts us in the position that we can meet customer demands when other businesses that have not been as fortunate, we have from a capital allocation perspective, on occasion, can't. But again, I think it's important to say too, that we're going to be very careful in the way that we do that because we want to make sure we're recognizing the value of our product.
Brent Thielman: Okay. Thank you, Ward
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Brent.
Operator: Thank you, we have a question from Michael Feniger from Bank of America, your line is open.
Michael Feniger: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in when we look at your updated pricing guidance, aggregates to 9% to 11% and kind of where you started with the first quarter. How you're going to build and it looks at your exit the year above that range in the 12% to 15% range. So just why can't double-digit pricing in 2023? That's just a baseline that we should be expecting. And would that level of pricing, what type of incremental margin should we be kind of sticking about on that level of pricing as our cost base hopefully normalizes by 2023? Thanks everyone.
C. Howard Nye: Michael, thanks for the question. I love your vision. The fact is what will talk more about 2023 when we get closer to it. I think your points a bit of and I'm ask Jim, just speak a little bit too, that type of build that we think we're gonna to see where things are going to exit. Obviously, we would not have taken up the midpoint of guidance unless we had some confidence in what we're seeing here in April but. Jim, you want to address at least the build?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. You're right. The exit momentum it'll be higher than days, Pete, growth momentum will be more accelerated, more robust at the back half of this year versus today, leading to hopefully continuation and good things into next year. So I think out makes sense what you just said. And as a mathematical matter, yes, that should imply a very robust incremental margins in the scenario that maintained those price increases, especially where you have a cost inflation of moderation scenario, which is likely to occur in 2023.
Michael Feniger: Thanks.
C. Howard Nye: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: There are no other questions in the Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. C. Howard Nye for closing remarks.

Among our accomplishments, in 2021, we achieved the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. This year marked our 10th consecutive year of increases in consolidated product and services revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We also made significant progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives, among them, successfully completing more than $3 billion in value enhancing acquisitions. These transactions expanded our product offerings and attractive new and existing markets, establishing a formidable coast-to-coast geographic footprint supported by robust underlying demand we will continue to build on these achievements with a focus on delivering sustainable, long-term operational and financial success in 2022 and beyond. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter and portfolio optimization efforts. Pricing momentum and growing product shipments aided in part by mild weather extending the 2021 construction season provided a strong finish to the year. We completed the acquisition of the Lehigh Hanson's West Region business on October 1, which provides Martin Marietta with new growth platforms in three of the nation's largest mega regions in California and Arizona and will serve as a valuable platform for continued expansion in the years ahead. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 27% increase in products and services revenues and a 17.5% increase in adjusted EBITDA capping-off a 12-month period of continued growth, robust M&A activity and record setting financial performance. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 priorities, we continually look for ways to optimize our portfolio through asset swaps and divestitures. To that end, following the closing of the Lehigh Hanson West acquisition, we received expressions of interest in the California based cement and concrete operations. As we focus on the product mix of our business to enhance value for our shareholders, we're currently evaluating alternatives for these operations and have classified these assets as held-for-sale. We anticipate providing more clarity regarding our plans for these assets during the first half of 2022. As I noted earlier, for the full year 2021, we established new financial records marking the 10th consecutive year of growth in each of the following metrics, products and services revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 10% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion increased 10% year-over-year or 14% excluding non-recurring gains and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $12.28 grew 6% year-over-year or 13% excluding non-recurring gains. I'm especially pleased to note that Martin Marietta’s strong earnings growth and thoughtful SOAR execution provided our investors with a total shareholder return of 56% in 2021 more than double the S&P 500. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for achieving longstanding financial success. I'm proud to report that we achieved a company wide world class last time and some great for the fifth consecutive year with a 7% reduction in the total reportable incidents Martin Marietta also reported a total entry incident rate of 0.8 rate of 0.84 exceeding world class rate levels for the first time in our history. Even more rewarding is that our strong 2021 safety performance includes the safety results of our newly acquired operations. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees both new and tenured who embrace Martin Marietta’s guardian and angel culture each and every day. With that overview, let's now turn to the full year operating performance. The building materials business experienced solid product demand across our geographic footprint, driven by single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and continued strengthen warehouses and data centers. Organic aggregate shipments increased nearly 4% to 193 million tones in line with the high end of our original 2021 guidance for volume growth and above 2019 pre -COVID levels. Acquired operations contributed an additional 8 million tons. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 3% with realized price increases partially offset by higher sales of lower price base and excess fuel material shipments in the second half of 2021. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this growth. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive, underpinned by market support prior announced price increases and overall customer confidence we anticipate being well positioned commercially and otherwise to respond to strong demand and more than offset inflationary headwinds in 2022. Our Texas cement business grew modestly to 4 million tons, establishing a new record for shipments supported by large projects, recovering energy sector activity and incremental pull-through from our interim downstream customers. Cement pricing grew 7% following multiple pricing increases during the year as the largest cement producer in Texas. Our cement operations are well positioned to continue to benefit from tight supply and healthy demand supported by diversified customer backlogs and our announced April 2022 price increase of $12 per ton. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 16% reflecting the healthy Texas and Colorado demand environment, pricing grew modestly. Despite solid fourth quarter volume improvement our Colorado asphalt and paving business was unable to overcome shipment declines from weather challenges and liquid asphalt supply disruptions that hindered construction activity during the traditionally productive summer months. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our full year 2021 discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we are evaluating our strategic alternatives as it relates to the California cement plants, related distribution terminals and California ready-mix operations. These assets, along with several parcels of land have been classified as assets held-for-sale on the balance sheet. And the profits they generate are shown as earnings from discontinued operations on the income statement. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are not included in either 2021 reported earnings from continuing operations or our forward earnings guidance. For our continuing operations, both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our record revenues and profitability, notwithstanding energy headwinds of almost $75 million which is nearly one-third higher compared with 2020 on an organic basis. Our aggregates pipeline established records for revenues and gross profit. Product gross margin of 29.6% included higher diesel costs and a $25 billion negative impact from selling acquired inventory. There was marked-up the fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 30.4% a 20 basis point decline versus the prior year. Gross profit per ton shift improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. Improve cement profitability in the second half of the year was not enough to overcome production inefficiencies and incremental storm related costs from February deep freeze in Texas. As a result, cement product gross margin declined 600 basis points to 31.8% despite top line growth. Increased raw material, energy and maintenance costs also pressured margins. Ready-mix concrete product gross margin was 8.3% relatively flat compared with prior year as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Adjusted products and services gross margin for asphalt and paving business decreased 180 basis points to 16.4% from higher raw materials cost and operational disruptions from a summertime Colorado liquid asphalt shortage. Magnesia Specialties achieved record revenues and profitability. Product revenues of $275 million increased 24% driven largely by demand for magnesia-based chemicals products used for cobalt extraction. Cobalt prices, which has doubled since the fourth quarter of 2020 are expected to remain at high levels and should support demand for chemicals products throughout 2022. Product gross profit increased 23% to $110 million even though higher costs for energy and contract services resulted in a 40 basis point decline in product gross margin to 40.2%. Martin Marietta ended 2021 with a strongest cash generation in our history, operating cash flow of $1.14 billion increased 8% driven by improvement in net working capital efficiency. SOAR continues to provide the framework to responsibly and sustainably grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. The company's long standing capital allocation priorities balance our value enhancing acquisitions with proven capital expenditures, and our goal of consistently returning capital to shareholders while preserving financial flexibility and an investment grade credit rating profile. In addition to the $3.1 billion to deploy for attractive platform and bolt-on acquisitions in 2021, we also invested $423 million of capital into our business. In November, we completed a capacity expansion project at our Bridgeport quarry adding over 3.5 million tons of aggregates annual production capacity and reducing our customers loading those cycle times. This project increases throughput at our flagship quarry in the fast growing Dallas/Fort Worth market. We will continue to prioritize high return capital projects to drive large expansion in 2022. We also returned $148 million to shareholders, reflecting our most recent dividend increase announced in August. Since a repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases, while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased 3.2 times as of December 31 reflecting the debt financed acquisition of Lehigh Hanson West in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past practice of reducing leverage following an acquisition, we expect debt ratio to be 2.5 times by year-end 2022. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2022 outlook.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. We're excited about Martin Marietta’s opportunities for sustainable long-term success in 2022 and beyond, as we build on our momentum and capitalize on favorable market fundamentals and underlying secular demand trends. For the first time since our industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005 public and private construction activity are both poised to accelerate, supporting increased shipments and attractive multi-year pricing acceleration for construction materials. As we embark on what we view as this golden age of aggregates. Martin Marietta has the ability and capacity to supply these needed products underpinned by our locally that pricing strategy. We will continue to do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. The new Federal Infrastructure Law along with strong State Department of Transportation budgets in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and now California, provide Martin Marietta with a long awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. The recently enacted infrastructure investment in Jobs Act is the nation's most significant infrastructure action since the introduction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956. This bipartisan legislation contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization, plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects. While this once in a generation investment in America's transportation networks stimulates economic growth and job creation immediately. We expect product demand benefits to begin in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. This new law will naturally favorably impact our results over an extended period of time and we expect this legislation to result in healthy State Department of Transportation budgets with estimated lettings above prior levels. [Boarders] approved state and local transportation measures will also promote sustainable growth and product demand. In November of 2021, Boarders approved 89% of state and local transportation ballot measures. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $7 billion in both one-time and recurring transportation funding with initiatives in Texas are top revenue generating state, accounting for over $4 billion of this total, these measures tangibly demonstrate the commitment of state and local governments to ongoing efforts to repair and improve our nation's aging infrastructure. Importantly, DLTs for our top states are well equipped from both financial and resource perspective to put increased transportation dollars to work and advance the growing number of projects in their backlogs. We expect enhanced infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments to this end use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments for reference, aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of 2021 organic shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from e-commerce evolving work trends and supply chain complexities that drive increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses, data centers, and reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. Notably, commercial and retail construction throughout our [San Antonio] markets is poised to inflect in become a more significant demand driver in 2022 as it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregates to the non-residential market accounted for 35% of 2021 organic shipments. Residential construction remains robust, particularly for single-family housing, which is yet to return to normalize levels. The National Association of Homebuilders forecast 2022 single-family housing starts to be 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019 despite longer material delivery times and labor shortages, Martin Marietta’s leading coast-to-coast footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given undergo conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics and accelerated de-urbanization. Single-Family Housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction when factoring in the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of 2021 organic shipments. In summary, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. Organic aggregate shipments are anticipated to increase 1% to 4% in 2022 is contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continue to impact an otherwise robust demand environment underpinned by a value of a volume pricing strategy, we expect growth in organic aggregates pricing of 5% to 8%. Annual price increases become effective from January 1 to April 1 and have already garnered market support. While inflationary pressures remain, we expect to expand upstream gross margins in 2022, supported by pricing acceleration and disciplined cost control. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, and a full-year results for acquired operations. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA for our continuing operations of $1.700 billion to $1.800 million. And to reiterate, our 2022 guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held-for-sale. To conclude we're extremely proud of our 2021 record setting safety, operational and financial performance supported by a growing demand environment and our consistently executed strategic priorities. We're confident in Martin Marietta’s long-term prospects. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we built the safest, best performing and most durable aggregate slug public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum and delivering attractive growth and superior value for our shareholders in 2022 and beyond.  Operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. And if necessary get back in the queue for additional one. One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms at Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Good morning Trey.
Trey Grooms: I wanted to first off Ward ask about your portfolio optimization efforts here. You're evaluating strategic alternatives for the California cement business and ready-mix. How are you thinking about that any color you can share with us on the strategic reasoning behind that and any kind of impact that you could color around that for these businesses you're looking at maybe moving out?
Ward Nye: Happy to try. Thank you for the question. If you think about what our business is going to look like and what we now refer to as the Pacific region, [indiscernible] we're done with what we're talking about, we'll have 17 aggregate locations there, we're going to have ready-mix in Arizona and we will have asphalt in California and Arizona. I think importantly, as we go back and take a look at from a tonnage or cubic yardage perspective, what that's going to look like, that's going to be around 13.5 million tons of stone in that marketplace, it's going to be about 1.1 million cubic yards, and run 8 million tons of asphalt. If you think back to the way that we've long spoken about our business Trey, you've heard us say, this is an aggregate slug company. And we do have a strategic cement business, but we have that in Texas. I think the strategic cement fits the way we've spoken up your Texas extraordinarily well. One of the things that we did identify for people, when we bought the Lehigh Hanson business is we were going to look at the cement business in particular to determine if we were the best owner. And after we closed on that transaction, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we received a number of inquiries from different parties interested in those businesses. From our perspective, we owe it to our shareholders and others to engage in that dialogue obviously part of what I've indicated, we anticipate having more for you on that here in the first half of the year. But again, from an aggregate slug perspective, we'd like this type of direction. The other thing that I think is so important to reiterate in California is well trend is we think the ability is very much ahead of us in that state to do more M&A on the aggregate side in California. And we think that's going to give us a very attractive long-term business. There obviously, we now have a platform position from which to grow. So Trey I hope that's helpful.
Trey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. And so you're keeping the aggregates business being aggregates led, obviously. But now that you've been in the driver's seat there for three or four months, any update you can give us around maybe the commercial efforts, particularly around the aggregates business there in California?
Ward Nye: No, I'm happy to. Trey, if we're looking at aggregate selling prices in that marketplace, generally, they tended to be about $0.70 a ton lower than Martin Marietta’s overall pricing. So if we look at pillar when we bought that business in Minnesota, those prices were for below Martin Marietta so for the prices in California. So we're very focused commercially on getting that more in line. What we've done in California, I think this is important is we have been very intentional about going out with pricing increases in that market, effective January 1. And the price increases from the customer feedback and from what we're seeing very directly have been received favorably the trends are actually quite attractive. We've indicated ASP increases across the enterprise of up 5% to 8% would be disappointed if California didn't outperform that. And in fact, that by January does not make a year. That's certainly what we've seen thus far in January Trey. So I think the commercial undertakings that we've had in that state even with ownership just as in a matter of months actually gone quite well.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thanks Ward. Thanks for taking my questions. Take care.
Ward Nye: You too Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thomson with Thomson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thomson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. Gave some great color just on end markets, but the one I'd like to focus in on a little bit more is on the commercial end market because that was one that we saw uncertainly you and others have started to see some improvement in the back half of 21’. And given those are longer term projects in general, that can have a scaling, impact on pricing too. So really kind of the question on commercial is, what are you seeing in terms of trends? How does that impact pricing now and also in the future as you're able to price up higher? And a little bit with that, in particular from a geographic standpoint Texas has been strong, but it's just a place that didn't need to get stronger did and how that impacts commercial and pricing for all of your [ups] in that market too? Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet, Kathryn. Thank you. So several things. If we go back about a year ago, when we had our Analyst Investor Day SOAR of 2025 to a sustainable future. Part of what we were talking about is we believe the Single-Family Housing state over that million year start that we would see in particular, the light portion of non-res continued to grow. So now let's step back and assess what ‘22 looked like and how that forecast into ’21. ‘22 was, or ‘21 was the only year and second year in our history where non-res volumes were more than infrastructure volumes were. So that tends to indicate that what we thought we were going to say see and what we outlined last February, in fact, happened throughout the year, meaning heavy non-res continued to be very good. It's incredibly aggregates intensive. And then as housing state solid, light non-res came behind that which led to the single largest end-use that we have. To your point, if we look at overall non-res in a state like Texas, the Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin Carter along I-35 continues to be incredibly strong. What we're seeing on that last mile delivery centers is impressive, you said it was hard to imagine that getting better and by the way, I'm there too. But as you noted, it has Samsung is looking to come in there with a $14 billion semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas Instruments is looking to build more in North Texas and Central Texas where we're seeing the high speed rail. So there are a number of projects on non-res that we think will continue to be really pretty most notable in that state. The other thing that we're seeing is obviously LNG has been on the sidelines for a while we anticipated that it would be at the same time we're looking at some jobs right now at Rio Grande LNG at Chevron Phillips, and [it’s near] that we think might see some degree of go-- going into this year. So to your point, that's just in Texas. The other thing that's notable is even seeing what's happening with rig counts, I mean rig counts have clearly been down. But the rig count at 610 at the end of January, was actually up 226 rigs, year-over-year. So we're seeing more activity and energy as well. If we come back and look at other states, so that matter to us, whether it's Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, we continue to see very good activity is that called on prepared remarks on warehousing and distribution. But here's what we're seeing too and we're seeing this in North Carolina, we're seeing retail and hospitality sectors, beginning to inflect. And obviously, there's been some recent activity in North Carolina with respect to Apple and Google and then Toyota has also come into the Greensboro High Point area, which actually in North Carolina has been a bit of a laggard. And seeing that type of activity there is really quite refreshing. And then Atlanta continues to be a top five domestic warehousing and data center market, and it shows absolutely no sign of slowing. So we feel like non-res is attractive, it continues to be really durable. And I think part of what's changed Kathryn is the heavy side of non-res particulars we're looking at these distributions have become so aggregates intensive and we've discussed before they tend to be in many respects almost concrete envelopes. To your point, you're selling relatively high priced clean stone into those concrete operations. So again, your part of your question was not just what's happening with non-res but what could that do trending relative to pricing. And I do believe this non-res projects will continue to take more clean stone, if we look at the clean stone it's going to be a higher price. So I think all of it adds up to a very attractive near-term, probably medium-term outlook Kathryn.
Kathryn Thomson: Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you actually for taking the call and the question. Can I piggyback it on a comment you just made a second ago where you talked about being underbuilt from a residential standpoint. Lots of investor concerns now around affordability rate increases, et cetera. But how are you all balancing that? Or what are you seeing in your marketplace given that we were underbuilt or 7 million starts for 8-plus years?
Ward Nye: Stanley that's such a good point because there's so much that still needs to be made up in housing. And I think that's one of the reasons that we've been so focused in SOAR, not just in building our business, but where we're building our business. So you need to think about what's happening with populations and where they're going. So our view of several things. One, the underbuilt conditions that you just outlined, together with nice population dynamics, puts us in a really attractive spot. So here are some numbers that I think are worth thinking about  If we look at where seasonally adjusted rates for Single-Family Housing came in '21, it was around 1.1 million starts. Starts are in '22, around 1.2 million; in '23, 1.3 million and in '24, around 1.4 million. But here's the math that I think we find compelling. By the time we get to 1.4 million single starts, if these numbers are right, in 2024, 2 things worth remembering: one, that will be back to 2003 levels. So we will have been away from that for 20 years, and the U.S. is going to have 40 million more people. Now if we think about where those people are or where those people are going and we start thinking about the states that are impact states for Martin Marietta you think about them in orders being Texas and Colorado and North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now add in California. So if we look at a state like Texas, that's 34% of our sales, but we look at the overall population, it's about 30% of the population of the United States. If we look at that -- or we're looking at 29 million people in the state. If we're looking at North Carolina, now 10.6 million people in the state, but we're looking to add 2 million people to North Carolina by 2040. So again, if we're looking at population trends, even with a rising interest rate, you're still seeing historically low rates, and you're seeing people who simply need homes and people move into these parts of the United States that can afford the homes. So we don't think single-family home building is going to go up to the numbers where it was back in 2005, 2006, we don't think that it should. But we think this is a very sustainable level, and we think the sustainable level helps us not just on the housing because, as you know, that's 2 to 3 times more aggregates intensive than multi-family, but we think what that continues to do, going back to the previous question, on non-res is really very attractive Stanley. So a lot of data, but it's our way of saying we feel like housing for our business in our leading state is going to be very durable for a while.
Stanley Elliott: Prefect. Thanks so much. And best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thanks Stanley.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Anthony.
Anthony Pettinari: You're guiding CapEx up roughly $100 million year-over-year in '22. I'm just -- is that primarily Lehigh and Tiller? And are there any major kind of growth projects that you'd call out as part of the '22 CapEx guide? And any kind of rough view on how we should think about CapEx long term.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, yes. It's Jim. Good morning. The answer is it’s mostly organic business. It's not Lehigh Hanson assets predominantly. The main project in 2022 is what we've outlined before is the large capacity expansion to melon. We refer to it as a -- that is the large projects that we've got going on next -- this year in 2022. So that's the main one. We expect to have a very high return on that one, especially given the pricing outlook that we're seeing for cement in that market. So that's going to be I think, a very high returning project for us. Otherwise, as I think about it in total, for modeling purposes, I think 9% of sales roughly is generally how I think about this business over time, and we're not too far off that, I think, in 2022.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That’s very helpful. I’ll turn it over.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Anthony.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Great. Thanks for having me on. I was just wondering if you could speak to infrastructure demand for this year and specifically just with some of the reports out of D.C. with delays in federal funding just given the lack of a full year federal budget. Are you anticipating any headwinds associated with that in your 2022 guide? And maybe speak more broadly as to the level of confidence that the projects that you thought are going to be moving forward with the passage of the infrastructure bill, the level of confidence that they're going to continue to move forward as expected?
Ward Nye: Thanks so much for the question, Garik. We feel pretty good about that. So a couple of things to think about. One, the new build is the law now. So the appropriations process has to go through its normal deal. As I think if you go back and look at the appropriations process, number one, they're negotiating it right now. Number two, if we go back and look at history, the latest that, that's ever found common ground is early in May, which puts it comfortably ahead of the next fiscal year for the government. The other thing that I think is so important to remember is $118 billion was deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, and it's lockbox. So we know that money is going to be there. So if you think of it, from a federal perspective through that lens, I think it gives you a pretty good foundation. I think then when you pivot and take a couple of other things into account: one, you still got significant COVID funding that's going to find its way into the system this year. And then thirdly, the last leg of that store, I would say is simply where the different DOTs themselves are. So again, if we look at the DOTs that are the DOTs that matter most to Martin Marietta, again, it's going to be Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California. In Texas, we're looking at FY '22 lettings that are expected to exceed $10 billion, and that's going to be the highest in 5 years. If we look in Colorado, they recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, ensuring a consistent stream of funding in that state through FY '23. If we're looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, FY '22 lettings have returned to historic levels. And if we're looking at the recently passed state biennium budget here in North Carolina, it's investing heavily in transportation with about $4.2 billion in FY '22. Similarly, in Georgia, we're looking for an expected increase of around $200 million or about 12%. In Florida, minings were up almost $2 billion. And again, the story in California well, with a $17 billion [California’s] budget. And we think with where SB1 is providing $50 billion of total spending through 2030, with about 3.7% of it going directly to highways and streets on an annual basis. We think that combination of the money that's been black box, what we think is going to be a fairly navigable appropriations process with the COVID money that's there and with what I've just outlined on those top 5, 6 states for North Carolina, we like what we're seeing relative to infrastructure and we believe that's going to be, Garik.
Garik Shmois: Great. I appreciate. That’s help enough.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Courtney Yakavonis: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Can we just go back to the Lehigh assets again? And I believe those that are remaining are now incorporated into guidance. But if you can just help us understand maybe the split between the sales that are -- sales and EBITDA that are in your guidance versus what is being held-for-sale? And then also, if you can talk about just how those assets are performing. I guess I would have expected the aggregates volume growth -- or sorry, pricing growth associated with the Lehigh business to be growing a little bit faster than the overall business. So if you could just help us think about how that's performing relative to the business overall? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Happy too. Courtney, thank you for the question. So I'm going to take the last part of your question first. And by the way, wholeheartedly agree with you. And that as I indicated early on, if we're looking at the Pacific business and we're looking at overall aggregate selling prices there, I think what we've indicated is they tend to be about $0.70 a ton lower than heritage Martin Marietta. We've said across the board, you should expect ASP increases of 5% to 8%. And what I'm indicating is we should expect California to outperform that. And frankly, if California is not seeing low double-digit price increases, I would be disappointed in that. So I think that's totally consistent with your thinking. And again, while January there's not a year make, we certainly like the numbers that we've seen in January. If we think about what EBITDA contribution is going to look like in that group, here's the way I would encourage you to think of it. We've indicated again, we're going to be an aggregates-led business there with around 13 million tons of stone. We will have a ready-mix business in Arizona, and we will have hot mix in California and Arizona. And if you think about EBITDA contribution, about 70% of the EBITDA contribution is going to be from aggregates in that business around 18% will be from ready-mix and around 13% will be from asphalt. So if you go back and look historically at what would have been cement business in California, together with a ready-mix business in California and simply take those out. And we put some pies together for you when we announced that transaction, showing how much was cement and aggregates and ready-mix and hot mix because at that point, we were talking about the upstream portion of it. And now what you're seeing in upstream at that time, by the way, Courtney, meant both aggregates and cement. Now we're talking about a business that with nearly 70% of the EBITDA being from aggregates is in the lexicon that we typically use an aggregates-led business, which is what we're looking to number one, have in that state. But Courtney, I think even more importantly, that's what we intend to keep building in that state. They are independent players there. There's a lot of potential M&A activity that's already underway in California. And so I'm trying to give you a snapshot of what it was, what it is right now. And what it is right now from an aggregate side perspective, we believe, will become even heavier.
Courtney Yakavonis: Okay. Thanks. And maybe -- could you just maybe just quantify how much that EBITDA contribution is from the acquisition? And then how much of that is now in discontinued operations? And if you could also just comment if there's any synergies as a result of the deal that we should be thinking about on either SG&A or other line items?
Ward Nye: Since it was a carve-out, really the synergies that will come from that transaction will be what we bring to it operationally, which we're in the process of doing and what we're doing commercially. And I think the commercial efforts are already evident. Relative to broken out EBITDA, we've actually not given that. I think if you go back and look at some of the information that we gave at the time relative to the Lehigh Hanson transaction and Tiller because we spoke about those in connection with each other. I think you can probably back into some of that, but we certainly had some arrangements with buyers and sellers that we would not talk about some of those numbers with greater specificity. So I'm not intending to be clever with you, not at all. I apologize on that. But I think overall, you can back into likely where those are. But again, because you're not buying a public company, moving offices, et cetera, and it's a carve-out, the synergies end up being more commercial and operational excellence over time.
Courtney Yakavonis: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on the volume guidance. I think you made some comments that you're still seeing some constraints due to labor shortages and the demand environment. And can you just help us think about your volume expectations for 1% to 4% growth, how much of that is being constrained by some of the supply chain issues that we're seeing in the market? And whether you're baking in any improvement in the back half of the year?
Ward Nye: There's going to be improvement. It will be in the back half of the year. I think a good example that we've been able to use in the past, Courtney, is we could probably see in the mid-single digits from a volume perspective, higher, for example, in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. almost on a daily basis than we're seeing right now simply because of the lack of trucks. So I think if we look at supply chains right now, primarily, it's one of logistics. It's how quickly can people bringing their trucks or how efficient can rail be in moving product. Overall, supply chain on labor for us is not a particular issue right now. Our supply chain itself is so domestically oriented. We haven't struggled with that. And equally, we're not struggling with putting adequate product on the ground. So we believe we can meet the demand. We believe we can do it in a very low cost way. We do think we're going to be in a position that we can assure that we're getting fair value for our products. But I do think the single largest challenge will continue to be transportation logistics. And we do believe there will likely be some degree of ease on that in the second half of the year. But I would tell you, we have not built that in. And the other thing that we have done, Courtney, and this is probably relative to say, in our pricing letters for this year, we have indicated to our customers that they should prepare for midyear price increases from us. At the same time, we have not factored that in to any of the guidance that we've given you. So do I think there's potentially some upside relative to logistic easing in half 2, I do. And when I tell you very candidly, we've told customers to, in many respects, you prepare for midyears, and that's not in our numbers, that would be grown.
Courtney Yakavonis: Great. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Courtney.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Michael Dudas: Good morning gentlemen.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Michael Dudas: Ward, the other hot topic certainly is inflation. There is a pretty aggressive print this morning on CPI. How is -- how do you see it from your angle internally? Are customers getting worried? And generally, when you put out your guidance for 2022, what were the levers or thoughts relative to energy materials? And is there any easing of that as we move throughout 2020? And what you're expecting for the year?
Ward Nye: Mike, thank you very much for the question. What I'm going to do is turn that over to Jim. I want him to walk you through what we're seeing relative to the labor M&R. And in particular, what we're seeing with respect to diesel. The short answer, at least from my perspective, goes back though to the prepared remarks and push said, we expect to see better margins in our upstream materials business this year than we did last year. So that's going to give you the punchline. But let me let Jim walk you through at least what we're seeing in some discrete areas of the business.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Sure. So the labor services component is probably around 5%. The other elements, which are smaller, slice of the cost pie supplies, 5% to 10%; repairs and maintenance, probably 5% to 10% as well. But obviously, the main component of what we sell is our stone, that is -- we own that. There's no -- and we source that from the ground. So that's going to help with the inflationary environment as well. So those costs are going up, but it's a smaller portion of our total cogs pie than other areas. And so on the aggregate piece, we're going to be growing margins, as Ward said overall. But again, those are the rough ways of thinking about it. Diesel in particular is the one, it was a headwind this year for 2021. We expect it to be a headwind in 2022. We've built in around $25 million of additional diesel costs in 2022. We're hoping that's not enough. It looks like it is right now, but we'll modify that if we need to.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.
Ward Nye: Good morning Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I wonder if you could talk about the length of your backlog in infrastructure based on the lettings that we're tracking, looks like we're above 2019 levels in terms of what's been awarded to your customers. Has that translated to your backlogs recovering to where they were when we were talking about them in 2018 -- in 2019? And in terms of the pricing associated with some longer-term work, were you folks able to get out in front of the inflation in terms of putting through significant price increases on longer-term work specifically that's been awarded to you over the past 6 months?
Ward Nye: Fair enough, Jerry. So keep in mind, even on longer-term work, historically, at least over the last decade, we would have been building in price increases on longer-term work on an annual basis. So do we anticipate those price increases in the future of being greater than some of them have been in the past. The short answer is yes. If we're looking overall at backlog, customer backlog, and that's the important way to try to remember it, what we're looking at right now is the backlog in aggregates, that's about 14% ahead of where it was in prior year. And if I'm breaking it down even more granularly, what you'll find is in the East Group, it's up around 17% versus prior year and the West Group is up around 10% versus prior year. So I'm particularly heartened by that because as you'll recall, that East Group, which is a pure Stone business tends to have the highest margins in the company. and they also have the largest backlogs in the aggregates group. The other thing that I think is worth adding to it as well, Jerry, is as we're looking at what's going on in MAG Specialties, they've got record backlogs across their business as well. Obviously, the chemicals portion of that business is doing exceedingly well. It clearly had a few cost headwinds relative to natural gas and some degree of what was going to the steel business for a portion of Q4. And so it's always interesting to me when margins in that business are taking down a little bit to 38.5%. That tends to give people's attention, but it's a solid 40% margin business, and customer backlogs in that business are records. And again, in aggregates they are up nicely ahead of prior year. And again, we're talking about midyears on those as well. We do protect customers on the pricing that they've had in the past, but we do expect to get midyear this year, and we expect the midyear to be attracted.
Jerry Revich: Yes. If only all business was bottomed at 38.5% margins. Thanks.
Ward Nye: You bet, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Feniger: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just you mentioned the margin expansion in the upstream business in aggregate, can you just help us understand the cadence there? I mean, diesel, energy prices are still kind of elevated right now on a year-over-year basis. So how should we be thinking about just 2022? Is it -- are we down a little bit in the first half, reflecting in the second half to get it up full year? Just how should we kind of think about the cadence through the year?
Ward Nye:
this stuff:
Jim Nickolas: Sure. So Michael, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So I'm going to stick with sort of somatic ways of thinking about it. Back-end loaded, profit-wise, that is true, more than historically we've seen for two reasons, really. One, our price increases are larger this year than they were last year, and those are largely effective ever one. So first quarter this year still hasn't really got the ticker from the accelerating price increases. So that effect is slightly delayed. Two, the diesel headwinds that you mentioned, those are more pronounced in the first half of the year than they will be in the second half of the year. So those are the two main reasons we're seeing gross profits will be back-end weighted versus historical patterns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson , Davis. I’m sorry, if I mispronounced Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: You are good. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Ward Nye: Good morning.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, if I've gotten any pushback this morning, it's maybe on the volume guidance, particularly around the low end of -- could you maybe comment on upside, downside risk to the volume outlook for this year?
Ward Nye: What if you think back to it, Adam, that's exactly where we came out last February, too, right? And we said 1% to 4%. And obviously, we finished the year on the high end of that. If we're looking at overall total. And keep in mind, the 1% to 4% is on the organic. If we're looking overall, we're talking 7% to 10%. So what I would say is, I think back to the dialogue I was having a few moments ago, can we meet the demand? Yes. Can we meet the spec requirements? Yes. Can we do that almost anywhere we need in the United States? The short answer is yes. If you can give me a good snapshot of what's going to happen with transportation and logistics, I can probably tell you what's going to happen relative to volume. So if we're right that we're going to see some degree of easing logistically and have to Frankly, I think that certainly is trending you towards the higher end of that. But if we think about what the issues are that may make that slower, it's not going to be an issue of demand and it's not going to be an issue of our ability to meet the demand. It's going to be what's happening relative to third parties and their ability to move this down.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: Yes, hello everyone. How are doing?
Ward Nye: Great. [indiscernible] hear your voice.
Timna Tanners: Likewise. Hey, just wanted to explore a little bit more the capital allocation comments, in particular, you mentioned of buybacks, but we haven't really seen much yet. So I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about what you think about in terms of deploying that? And how you think about -- obviously, you keep flagging the opportunity to grow more. And I'm just wondering the timing of further acquisitions, I assume that's just a question of availability. But are you looking at a particular leverage goal, debt leverage well before you deploy any of those opportunities? Thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Well, again, I'm going to kick that over to Jim. As part of what Jim told you in his prepared comments, basically looking at the business, as we're looking at it right now, we're going to be back to our 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of the year. So as you can tell, this is a business that de-levers very quickly. If you think about our overall capital priorities, the short answer is, Timna, they haven't changed over time. I'd ask Jim to walk you through those, but M&A continues to be one that's been coming to us. But Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So we wouldn't pass on an acquisition today if it came through based on our leverage. We have the ability to go after that opportunity and still deleverage. So that's not a roadblock for us at this point. And as we've mentioned, we do expect to get to 2.5 times by year-end on a net basis. And even with that in mind, we will take a balanced approach to our capital -- so whether we buy back shares, that's on off the table this year, either even with those things, M&A and share buyback, et cetera, increasing dividend, hopefully in August. That is all in the cards, even with our leverage where it's at. That's all contemplated with our stated forecasted end of year net leverage of 2.5 times. So hopefully that answers your question.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Hi, good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask about -- just to build on -- you're answering to a previous question about the volume guidance of 1% to 4% and maybe this reflects the backlog, but do you expect more growth in the East versus the West? Can you just talk about how you're thinking about east versus west in that 1% to 4%? And then I guess just my question with respect to cement would be just on the profitability for 2022. It seems like the volume upside is pretty limited. You're running those 2 plants pretty close to full capacity now, I would guess. So is it all just price cost at this stage? Or is there something else we should think about in terms of profitability, in terms of the puts and takes on profitability for 2022 cement.
Ward Nye: David, thanks for the question. Good morning to you. So a couple of things. One, if we think about the way the country has recovered over the last several years, the East really took a harder fall in the downturn than the Southwest and in some respects on the West. So we've seen markets like Atlanta recovering more vodantly right now as well as the Carolinas and up into Virginia. And now we're seeing a very attractive recovery in Maryland as well. So if I'm looking at east versus west broadly, I am thinking we're likely to see a more snap back in the East in many respects than we are in the heritage West. I think California is going to be an attractive market for us. But again, I'm comforted by the fact that we're seeing good activity in the East. With respect to your cement question, look, you're internally right, I mean we're tapped out in many respects at about 4 million tons right now. Obviously, we're adding capacity to what we're doing in Texas with the FM 7 capital project that Jim spoke to before. I guess several things. One, our efficiencies were not necessarily helped last year by that decrease that occurred last February. So David, as you may recall, I know you're accustomed to it in Cleveland, but in Dallas and San Antonio, they're not accustomed to the type of weather that they had last year. That was there for an extended period of time that really not only slowed down sales, slowdown production and actually caused an oversized degree of M&R. We don't think that's going to recur. So we do believe there are going to be efficiencies that simply come from that. If we're looking overall at what we think is going to happen relative to pricing, Again, we saw multiple price increases last year in cement. Right now, we're looking at a $12 a ton increase in April. I think the other thing that can be a bit of a swing factor there, David, is where is some of that going to be as well. Obviously, DFW is a very healthy market, so is Central Texas. But part of what we saw in the quarter was more material heading to West Texas. Now granted, percentages in this concept sounds really big tonnages are huge. So if we're looking at quarter percentages changes, we saw 215% more material head to West Texas. Now what does that mean? Is there a practical matter? 37,000 tons went to West Texas in the quarter versus 12,000 tons in the previous quarter. But as we look at average selling price on those, that's at an average selling price of around $203 a ton versus a total cement all-in number of $127. So I would say several things. Do we anticipate a better year operation in Texas than we had last year? Absent another deep freeze, the answer is yes. Do we anticipate a better pricing environment across the state? The answer is yes. And do we anticipate seeing more material, not massive amounts, but more going into West Texas year-over-year? The answer to that is yes as well, David. So I hope that helps.
Operator: All right. Moving to our last question from Zane Karimi with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Zane Karimi: Hey, good morning guys.
Ward Nye: Hi, Zane.
Zane Karimi: Thanks for the color so far. And then an extension on Courtney's question earlier, but I was just wanted to dive into the new regions that you're now in with the California and Arizona from the Lehigh transaction. And in particular, get a better picture on any sort of new challenges you're experiencing in these spots? Any sort of labor constraints that are new or supply deficiencies or the challenges that you experienced in the region?
Ward Nye: That's a great question, Zane. And the good news is, look, we've had a highly enthusiastic team there that's delighted to be part of Martin Marietta. One of the things that I outlined early on is we achieved world-class safety metrics on both lost time and total case despite the fact that we had really one of the largest years of M&A in our company's history. The reason that I start out with that is that, to us, is so cultural and so important. And when we have colleagues who appreciate the importance of that to us, that's a really good starting point. I think something that we have clearly brought to that though, and I think it goes back to the portfolio optimization efforts. We are, first and foremost, in aggregates business. So what I would tell you is we're assuring that our new colleagues in California understand that, that is for us the alpha and the mega of what this business is in so many respects. And being superb operationally is going to be important and vital and absolutely who we are. Now from a timing perspective, saying, as you would imagine, getting operational improvements isn't as immediate at times as you can get commercial improvements. So what are we happy with? We're very happy to see that the training that we put in place, the timing that we put in place and otherwise relative to commercial activity has worked really well. Do we have work ahead of us relative to bringing these sites up to Martin Marietta operational levels? We do. And actually, that's what I see is the good news part of it because we think there's nice things that can be done with this business, not over the near-term, but near, medium and long. The other piece, and it's not so much a challenge, but it's realistic is we need to make sure that the people who are in that state in business in that state know who we are because relationships are important, and we want to grow our business in that state. And we want to grow our business, first and foremost, in the aggregates line of it. So again, no big surprises there. I think very much what we thought and importantly, the areas that we thought we could make some refinements that can make a difference have been happening so far. So I've been saying thank you for that question, and I hope that response is helpful.
Zane Karimi: Yes. Very much, sir. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Ward Nye: Well, it looks like that's the end of the questions for today. So thank you all for joining today's earnings call. Underpinned by our disciplined execution of our proven strategy and our long-standing capital allocation priorities, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving sustainable growth and superior shareholder value as we saw it to a sustainable future. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2022 results in just a few months. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the Company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg : Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've made available during this webcast and on the investors section of our website, Q3 2021 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.  In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by U.S. Securities Law in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance.  Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings which are available on both our own and the SEC website. Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our third quarter operating performance and our recently completed acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results after which Ward will discuss market trends as we look ahead to 2022. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye : Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta has continued growth and record results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. And with fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this time last year, our Company-wide safety incident rates are surpassing world-class levels.  I'm proud to report that we are on track to deliver the most profitable and safest year in our Company's history. We're also excited about the progress we're making on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further position our Company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. On October 1st, we welcome more than 1200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team as we successfully completed the acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region business. With this outstanding team, strong business in key assets now a part of our offering, we're well-positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics and accelerating public and private construction activity in important California and Arizona regions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix.  It also provides new growth platforms for our continued geographic expansion. I'm grateful to our colleagues for the dedication and perseverance in their efforts to complete the acquisition, the second largest in our Company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Lehigh West Operations, quickly realize synergies, and deliver significant stakeholder value. Integration activities are progressing as planned from both an operational and customer-facing perspective. As highlighted in today's release, we once again established record results for revenues and gross profit for both the quarter and year-to-date. To recap for the first 9 months of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to a record $1.1 billion. Both our building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses continue to capitalize on the ongoing economic recovery.  During the quarter, organic shipment and pricing growth combined with value-enhancing acquisitions, more than offset higher-than-expected energy-related costs and contributed to our record setting results. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 18% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% to $450 million, adjusted EBITDA of $490 million increased 13% on a comparable basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.25 grew 11% on a comparable basis.  As a reminder, the prior year quarter included $70 million or $0.87 per diluted share up non-recurring gains on surplus plan sales, and divested assets that affect quarter-over-quarter comparability. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance. We continue to experience growing product demand across our 3 primary end-use markets. Organic aggregate shipments increased 6% notwithstanding contractor capacity constraints and wet weather in several markets that govern the overall pace of construction activity. Notably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the strong underlying demand trends across our geographic footprint. Total aggregate shipments, including shipments from acquired operations increased 10%. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 2%, reflecting a higher percentage of lower-priced based on shipments during the quarter. Additionally, our East Division, which has selling prices in excess of our corporate average, had the opportunity to meet customer needs with a low -priced excess fill product that had we not shipped, we otherwise would have incurred costs to relocate.  We expect shipments of this excess fill material, which are profitable and not a substitute for higher-value products to continue through the remainder of the year. That's why we updated our full-year 2021 organic pricing growth guidance to now range from 2.5% to 3.5%. To be clear, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive. In fact, supported by strong underlying demand and rapid cost inflation in the broader economy, we successfully implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas.  These actions, combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility, bode well for meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022. Our Texas cement business established a new quarterly record for shipments, which increased 4% to over 1 million tons. Large and diversified projects, recovering energy sector activity, and incremental pull-through from our internal downstream customers, supported record monthly shipment levels in both August and September. Cement pricing increased 8% as the second round of price increases this year went into effect on September 1st.  Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments increased 23% driven by the large non-residential projects and operations acquired late last year in Texas. Concrete pricing grew 2% following the implementation of midyear price increases in Texas. Additionally, we've announced a third price increase in the Dallas, Fort Worth market effect October 1. Asphalt shipments increased 116% overall, driven by contributions from our Minnesota -based operations acquired earlier this year.  Our Colorado asphalt and paving business experienced shipment declines and supply disruptions from midsummer liquid asphalt allocations throughout the Rocky Mountains. That circumstances now been resolved. Despite these short-term issues, market fundamentals remain strong across the Colorado Front Range. Organic asphalt pricing improved modestly. Before discussing our preliminary 2022 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim.
Jim Nickolas : Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. Both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our double-digit growth in product revenues and increased profitability. That said, increase energy expense continues as a headwind, temporarily pressuring margins. For the third quarter alone, total energy costs increased $28 million or nearly 50% Company-wide, as compared with last year. Absent this headwind, our consolidate adjusted gross margin would have outpaced the record set in the prior-year quarter.  Aggregate’s product gross margin of 34.2% included higher diesel and other production costs, as well as a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.9%, a 150-basis point decline versus prior year. Cement product gross margin declined 250 basis points driven by higher raw material cost and a $6 million increase in natural gas and electricity cost.  Ready-mix concrete product gross margin improved modestly to nearly 10% as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $72 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher costs for energy and contract services, driving a 100-basis points improvement in product gross margin to 39%.  As part of our longstanding capital allocation priorities, we continue to balance value enhancing acquisitions with prudent capital spending, and returning cash to shareholders while preserving a healthy Balance Sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. Consistent with SOAR 2025, we acquired a crushed concrete aggregates producer in the Houston area in late July. These acquired aggregates operations expand our customer base and product offerings and one of the nation's largest addressable markets. We have raised our full-year capital spending guidance to $475 million to $525 million to include anticipated Lehigh West Region 's capital expenditures.  We continue to prioritize high return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its confidence in our future performance, and a resilient, and growing free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.44. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividend, as well as share repurchases.  In early July, we issued $2.5 billion of Senior Notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.2% and a weighted-average tenure of 15 years, primarily to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times as of September 30. Leverage on a pro form basis, inclusive of recent acquisitions, is modestly above 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times within the next 18 months.  As detailed in today's release, we've updated our full-year 2021 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results that factor in higher energy costs and the fourth-quarter contribution from the newly acquired Lehigh West Business. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1 billion, $500 million to $1 billion, $550 million dollars. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye : Thanks, Jim. Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint. Expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment, single-family housing strength, heavy industrial projects of scale, and light non-residential recovery should support growing construction activity and contribute to attractive pricing acceleration for heavy-side building materials for years to come. Importantly, we have both the ability and the capacity to supply these needed products, and supported by our locally led pricing strategy, we'll do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. While navigating an imperfect legislative process, our nation is nonetheless on the cusp of achieving the most significant infrastructure action of this century. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains a 5-year surface transportation reauthorization and provides $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects passed the U.S. Senate in August, with 69 bi partisan votes. Though the U.S. House of Representatives could not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week before the then current short-term extension of the federal highway and public transportation programs expired on October 31st, the house and senate did approve a short-term program extension, keeping surface transportation funds flowing to the States through December 3rd.  The consensus opinion with which we strongly agree is that this important legislation will be signed into law before year-end. Aside from the overall economic growth we expect to occur with the increased federal transportation investment, the steps we've taken over the past decade to responsibly grow and expand our footprint will also benefit Martin Marietta 's near and long-term outlook. Project lettings for our Company's top 5 States Department of Transportation or DOTs, continue to positively trend. Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues are well-positioned from both the DOT funding and resource perspective to efficiently deploy increased federal and state transportation dollars and advanced the growing number of projects and their backlogs. Notably, California, the nation's most popular state and the world's fifth largest economy, becomes a top state for Martin Marietta following the Lehigh West acquisition.  Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, manages a $17 billion annual budget. Additionally, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, commonly referred to as Senate Bill 1 or SB1 provides $54 billion or approximately $5 billion annually through 2030 to fund state and local road, freeway, and rail projects. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of third quarter organic shipments, showing sequential growth since this year's second quarter, but still well below our 10-year historical average of 43%.  Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data-centers. We've also seen early signs of recovery in light commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Atlanta, Denver, and the Texas Triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given that it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregate shipment to the non -residential accounted for 35% of third quarter organic shipments.  Across our cost-to-cost footprint, single family residential [Indiscernible] are expected to remain robust despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times. Significant under-building in commensurate with notable population gains over the past decade and accelerated deorganisation support these trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2-3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities.  Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter organic shipments. In summary, we believe our industry is about to see public and private sector construction activity coalesce for the first time since its most recent 2005 peak, supporting both increased shipments and an attractive pricing environment for construction materials. For 2022, our preliminary view anticipates organic aggregates shipments will increase in the low-to-mid single-digits, As contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continued to impact on otherwise robust demand environment.  Underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in 2022 organic aggregates pricing. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record setting safety, operational, and financial performance, and look forward to continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter and 2022. As a result of our thoughtfully developed and consistently executed strategic priorities, our Company's future is bright.  With our steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices in store execution, Martin Marietta intends to build the safest, best performing and most durable aggregates lead public Company poised to deliver attractive growth and superior value for all of our stakeholders. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question. Please stand-by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice work in the quarter, especially given some of these headwinds that are out there.
Ward Nye : Thank you, Trey.
Trey Grooms : So, Ward, your initial outlook for '22 around aggregates pricing, looking for mid to high single digits, clearly an acceleration from what we've seen this year and in recent years. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expectation, your comfort level there? And maybe bridging that from this year. Is it more reliant on more midyear increases or is this primarily a spring increase that's driving this and then as part of that, the pricing discussions -- summit price announcements that we've been hearing about for next spring are pretty healthy. So maybe if you could speak to what's your thinking on that front as well as we go into next year.
Ward Nye : Happy to. Trey, thank you for your question. I think several things are worth noting. One, we saw a nice series of midyear price increases this year, and we saw that in two markets that matter a lot for us. We saw that in Texas and we saw that in the Carolinas. So that immediately starts setting the framework for next year. Keep in mind as I outlined in the prepared remarks, part of what we've seen this year as an optimal headwind is frankly a higher degree of base sales that we've seen particularly in the East, as well as some [Indiscernible] sales that have gone out of the East.  What I think is important to keep in mind Trey is the pricing range that you see is really a heritage driven range. In other words, we're not taking into account what we believe is going to happen in California and that, we're not taking into account what we believe can happen in Minnesota and that. As reminder, those markets historically have been below corporate average. So, if I reflect on where we're positioning toward next year on the conversations that we have had with our customers to-date and what we believe the overall economic environment is likely to be, we have a very high level of confidence in the ASPS that we're talking about for next year.  You had also asked specifically about cement, which is the -- a perfectly fair question. As we look at cement, several things that are worth noting as we think about the year that's wrapping up as well as the year that we're going into. Keep in mind, several things have happened this year. 1. Our price increase in cement in Texas in April was $9 a ton. We came back in September and the second price increase, that was at $8 a ton. That's the first time we've seen a mid-year of that sort since 2014.  Again, I think underscoring nice overall pricing momentum. If we're looking at what we're anticipating next year, we're anticipating a price increase in cement up $12 a ton. As a practical matter we're looking at that effective January 1 in California, we're looking at that relative to April 1 in Texas. So, a little bit of a different date between those 2 states, but still a very common number on focusing. We also believe in total candor(ph) that if some of the governing aspects around the volume would go away, volume could actually be better.  It's interesting is when looking at volume today and I'd mentioned this trait because I think this also has an effect on pricing from an emotional perspective as well as others. But, what our team in Texas would tell us today is if there was more trucking available, say for example in the Dallas, Fort Worth market, We could be selling on a daily basis, 3% to 5% more tonnage than we're selling today. So, I think all of those factors call us to underscore what we believe 2022 is lining up to be a very attractive pricing environment for the Company.
Trey Grooms : Thanks, Ward, that's all very encouraging and thanks for the color and thanks for taking my questions. Good luck.
Ward Nye : You bet you. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Bryan Barros : Thank you, morning. This is actually Bryan Barros on for Kathryn and thank you for taking my question. To the extent you can -- can you expand on what you're hearing on how your customers are thinking about next year, the makeup of their backlogs across projects or end markets? And you touched on it just now on the last question, but how would the current bottlenecks around labor and trucking are playing into that outlook in your initial thoughts on the 2020 volume guidance. Thank you.
Ward Nye : No, thank you, Brian. I'll start with the latter part first, and that is what we've done in looking at volume next year is assuming that we're going to continue to see same governors around volume that we have this year. So again, I think we've taken a very responsible view at volume next year, and potentially, if you see some of these labor, transportation, and other backlogs or issues resolve themselves. It could be better next year. If we're thinking about overall customer backlog and the way that they're thinking about their business, here is the way that I would at least encourage you to think about that. As we are looking over all across the aggregates business, we're seeing it about 15% ahead of prior year levels based on what our customers are telling us. And there is a nice break. If we're looking in the East Group, again, that's up almost 14% based on what customers are saying to us. If we're looking in the West group, that's up around 18% based on customers are telling them. What I think is important as well, we came into the year with very attractive cement backlog. Cement, year-over-year is modestly down but I think what's important is we have some very notable projects that are in the pipeline right now that we think actually adds to that pretty considerably. And importantly, as we look at our Magnesia Specialties business, we're looking at record customer backlogs and we see very robust line business going into 2022 and we see some chemicals tailwinds going into the new year as well. So, it's consistent with the comments that you heard that I shared in my prepared remarks. This is 1 of those instances where we feel like we're seeing public and private come together in a very attractive, very powerful way. And part of what I think is telling about this one is we believe it has the capacity, particularly if we got the new highway bill to be in place, not just for a matter of quarters, progress for a matter of years. So, Bryan, I hope that helps.
Bryan Barros : I do. Thank you.
Ward Nye : You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich : Yes, Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye : Good morning, Jer.
Jerry Revich : If you could comment -- Hi, I'm wondering if you could comment for aggregates on the cadence of pricing that you expect to play out over the next couple of quarters as you lay out the pricing expectations for '22. Now does that assume that the exit rate on a year-over-year basis is higher than that entrant’s rate. Can you maybe just talk about that if you don't mind?
Ward Nye : I'm not sure that I can give you something on that that's going to be precise and give you good direction on it, because I think so much of that's going to be driven. It can be particularly in fourth-quarter by seasonality and what's happening in some parts of the country as opposed to others. What I will tell you is the conversations we've had with customers, or conversations that we've already had. The correspondents that we were going to have with customers to basically affirm for our pricing for next year has already gone out. Really, Jerry, I think if there's risk to pricing next year.  Frankly, it's more on the upside as opposed to the downside because the numbers that we gave you in the release and that I referenced in my prepared remarks are heritage numbers only. And, obviously, part of what contractors are seeing today, and I'm sure they're seeing across a whole host of inputs, is an inflationary environment unlike anything that they've seen for a while. The other thing to keep in mind is if you go back and look at whether it's CPI, PPI or otherwise over a long period of time and by that, I don't meet a year or 2, I mean decades. What you'll find is aggregate pricing has consistently outperformed that metric and this year actually was behind it just a bit. So, I expect to see that gap made up next year, Jerry. So that's how I would think about that.
Jerry Revich : And Ward, in terms of the timing of the increases, a lot of times in year markets, your time increases for March and April instead of January 1 for aggregates. Is the thinking any different this year, given the extraordinary weather, or excuse me, inflation. Are you folks -- the increase that have gone out were they for January 1, which would be I think sooner than normal.
Ward Nye : But you're right. It does vary and there will be some markets that go January 1, there will be some that will go April 1. As a practical matter, Jerry. because there's not that much heavy-side activity that occurs in January and February. Keep in mind, we've launched that, for example, that the last 2 weeks of March can make or break the first quarter. So, whether they go into effect in January or whether they go into effect in April, typically for us isn't that moving.  We're trying to make sure that we maintain your relationships with customers that are so important and don't put them in a position that they find themselves in anyway dislocated, so we've tried to remain relatively consistent from a timing perspective. But again, we don't feel like the timing from January to April, given the seasonality effect of those period of months, is going to be at moment.
Jerry Revich : And lastly, I'm wondering, can you talk about the acquisitions in terms of the performance? So far, anything interesting that's come to light since you won assets and I know that California asset you haven't known all that long but maybe you could tell us how it's going so far versus your initial expectations?
Ward Nye : Thank you for the question, Jerry. I would say that the integration is actually going quite well in all of them. We've got a single process that we're utilizing for this integration, so 1 team continues to look at it. The nice thing about this is the integration are occurring, obviously in the West, in the Central and of the Southwest. So, no particular team is overwhelmed with what's going on. Operationally, we're very pleased with the way that it's going.  The teams that have become part of Martin Marietta team to this process, have proven to be every bit as good as we thought that they would. I continue to be moved by what I feel we can do relative to bring commercial excellence to these operations. And I think particularly in California, that's likely to be the upside that we're going to see there. But again, if you think about what's happened this year, it's going over $3 billion worth of deals.  So, if we go back and look at Tiller, which came in at the end of April, SCC that can in at the end of July and again, Lehigh Hanson's came in at the beginning of October. By any stretch that's a big M&A year for Martin Marietta. And we're very pleased with the people and we're very pleased with the operations and very pleased with the site. So, I appreciate the question. I'm happy to tell you there have been no negative surprises.
Jerry Revich : All right. Terrific. Thanks.
Ward Nye : You bet. Take care Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies, your line is open.
Phil Ng : Hey guys. How should we think about the annual sales and EBITDA contribution from some of your recent acquisitions, particularly high, given the size of it for 2022? And then Ward, I think your comments for aggregate pricing was -- for next year is largely on your legalese -- legacy side. Is there reluctance to give a little more color on that front just simply because the deal just closed and you haven't had any real firm conversations with your customers or It could take a little time to begin -- to get that pricing more in line with the broader Company?
Ward Nye : Phil, thank you for the question. I think several things. 1. We're going to give you a good sense of where we believe those businesses will be when we come out in February next year. Part of what you'll see if you go to the supplemental information with today's release is you'll get a good snapshot, particularly relative to The Lehigh West on what the tonnages look like in aggregate cement ready-mix and asphalt. So that will give you a nice way to back into some of that. You will also see a nice '21 -- 2021 budget EBITDA contribution. So again, I think that can put you there.  With respect to the overall pricing as you would imagine, we've got a nice blend of new products in Martin Marietta, but importantly, Heritage Martin Marietta’s players, particularly in California, that are working together in that marketplace. I can tell you that our correspondents on pricing went out to our customers last week. These are live conversations -- by the way, they've all been very good conversations, as I indicated in one of the earlier questions, if I had to speculate today, my guess would be on a percentage basis. We will likely see ASPS on a percentage basis on the newly acquired operations on percentages that will be higher than here in Martin Marietta. So again, I don't see a downside right there, I see potential upside opportunity in those markets. And again, to your point, we can probably, if I really wanted to dig deep, be a little bit more specific with you on Lehigh Hanson's the same time on mindful that we've owned that business were about 32 days. And our sense is, let's have it for a little bit longer than 32 days before we get into too much detail on that. But hopefully, the direction I've given you and the supplemental information relative to tonnage EBITDA contributions, where we are relative to the organic business on ASPS, in my view that the acquired operations will likely over-achieve that, gives you a sense of how we look at that.
Phil Ng : And then just one follow-up on the pricing, Ward. Pricing came in a little lighter this year and then a part of that is just mix from the [Indiscernible] business and the guidance you gave, if you had a level set that, is that mid-to-high single-digit still a good way to think about it, just given how it's a little lower this year?
Ward Nye : No. As I said, I certainly don't see downside to aggregate price in next year. And if we're looking at the film material that's gone out this year in the East in particular year to date, Phil, this will give you a sense of it. It's been about 900,000 tonnes. And part of what's happened here over the last -- during the last quarter as well is we started shipping some stone on a large NCDOT project that's here and the Raleigh that was bid about 2 years ago.  So again, those are just some of the more optical issues. Something that I think is worth always keeping in mind, Phil, is, when [Indiscernible] is going in a year like this, what you know is going to happen, is the clean stones want to come either, because at some point you're going to put either asphalt or concrete on top of the clean stones. And we actually see those clean stone pricings -- prices moving in a very attractive way.
Phil Ng : Super. Thanks a lot, Ward.
Ward Nye : Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. I'll switch gears here a bit and ask about the Magnesia Specialties. Is that a business that you guys are capped in terms of your output or your tonnage? Just curious how you're thinking about that. Is there a chance to expand it given how rich the margins are and the outlook for commodity prices being so good to those in-markets?
Ward Nye : Great question, Stan and thank you for asking that. That's a business that performs quarter-after-quarter extraordinarily well and never gets depressed that team deserves. Look, you saw what I did, too and that was record revenues through up 30% over the prior-year quarter. I mean, several things were happening when it's a strong metal mining activity around world. We're seeing good activity in steel. To your point, in many respects, we are kept -- we're running at capacity on volumes than in that marketplace right now. Pricing was up nearly 4%. We think pricing may have some nice upside to it.  One thing that's worth noticing though, is if we look at where domestic steel is now, steel is running at about 80% -- almost 85%. That's up from Q2 last year when it found the bottom. It's up almost 51% since then. The other thing that I think is really impressive in that business when you look at the margins at 39%, and you take into account that natural gas pricing for Q3 was up 26%. And if we look at really what natural gas pricing has looked at for a longer period of time than that. If we go back to January 1 this year, I want to say in January, net gas pricing was at [Indiscernible], it's up almost $2.44 since then, almost a 146%. So, I guess what I would say is what we'd like to grow that business in particular? Point to your question, the short answer is we would. We've looked at ways to grow that business in the past, we will continue to do that. Are we largely at capacity at Woodville and Manistee today large that we are? Do we have the ability, on occasion, and will we continue to look at refining our products out of those 2 different facilities to make sure we're doing more high margin products? The short answer there is yes, we will.  So, the focus will be on continuing to control costs, which they do extraordinarily well. Being a price leader, which is something they've been focused on, continuing to look for ways to add to that business. We'd liked to do it but, in the meantime, making sure that we continue to refine the products that we're putting out. So, I would suggest you, Stanley, it's probably a 4- or 5-fold approach to that business.
Stanley Elliott : Perfect. Thanks so much and best of luck
Ward Nye : Thank you so much, Stanley
Operator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Courtney Yakavonis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. If we could just talk a little bit about the cement business and the updated guidance, I think you increased revenues, but really no additional profit there. Is that all higher energy costs or was -- it's some dilutive impact of acquisition? If you can just help us understand the guidance for the fourth quarter there and how to frame it for thinking about 2022.
Ward Nye : Courtney, [Indiscernible]. Thank you for the question. What -- Jim and I will bifurcate this. I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing going on in the market. I want Jim to come back and talk specifically about some of the issues that we had in maintenance this quarter and part of what we've seen in inventories. But here's what I would say overall, if we look at the volume, the volume is not too very attractive, so it's a 4% overall increase. We've had some July rain that slowed things down in Central and South Texas.  So, if we're looking at what was happening coming out of [Indiscernible], that was down about 3%. Now, the flip side is we saw very nice volumes coming out of North Texas at Midlothian, up about 6.7%. We also saw, in a percentage basis, very nice percentages up in West Texas. Now, what I'll tell you is, percentages on West Texas and volumes on West Texas tell two different stories. Because you can have a very big percentage, because the volumes have been overall quite low.  But what I'm happy to see is at least on a year-to-date basis, is West Texas volumes were up almost 66% as we continue to see mining do better. If we look in North Texas again, all by itself in September, that was up 25%. So, we saw a record volume quarter coming out of cement. Now we did have some maintenance issues that I want Jim to speak to, and I'll preface it with we're done with maintenance for the year on the big -- taking the kilns down. And then we had some inventory issues that he can walk you through that, I think, will give you some great color so, Jim over to you, please.
Jim Nickolas : Yeah. Sure. So, Courtney, so what we're really talking about is our old guidance to our updated guidance, right? So, what had happened there was we had a more downtime than we had planned on due some maintenance. So, there's $3 million more of higher maintenance. But the bigger effect for the year was the draw - down inventories. So, we had record shipments as you heard on our prepared remarks. The record shipments -- but our production levels were below what we had expected.  And so, when you have that situation, we have inventory draw - down into -- our fixed cost absorption was worse than we had forecast and that's the biggest piece of that headwinds for guidance. And then separately, of course, energy headwinds are elevated higher than we had forecasted previously, These are non-diesel headwinds so nat -gas, as Ward mentioned earlier, electricity, and to a much lesser extent, coal, All those costs were higher. Our view of it now is higher cost than our view of that 3 months ago. So, those were the real drivers of that. Did I answer your question, Courtney?
Courtney Yakavonis : Yes. That was helpful. And I think you guys had also previously guided to what you thought energy costs would increase for the year. You obviously mentioned that you're expecting higher cost now, but can you just update us on what the guidance is baking in for a total increase -- for the fourth quarter or for the year?
Jim Nickolas : Yes. So, we're -- we -- last quarter, our view for diesel was right. So, we're spot on Q3, Q4 versus forecast diesel costs we -- we're still comfortable at the currently forecast levels. What we're surprised by was the non-diesel energy costs in Q3 and the forecasts now reflects that. So, I'd say it's up roughly depending on the fuel type, 35% to 60% year-over-year so that's what's now in our forecast. So that's in our new forecasts and we don't expect that to get worse at this point. Of course, we could be wrong and if we are wrong, the way to cure that is through midyear price increases down the road.
Courtney Yakavonis : Okay. Great. And then just --
Ward Nye : Court, I have a quick comment.
Courtney Yakavonis : Go ahead.
Ward Nye : Could give you a quick snapshot on that. So really for Jim is 15% of the impact was from diesel. If we look at energy across the entire business, and then a $28 million almost 2X bet if we look all in on energy, so I just want to make sure you had those 2 numbers.
Courtney Yakavonis : Great. Thanks. And then just lastly, on the base material in excess fill that you sold this quarter, I believe you said you expect that to continue for the fourth quarter, are you baking in an assumption that that continues into 2022 or will that be fully cleared out by the end of the year?
Ward Nye : But it'll probably be largely cleared up by the end of the year. I think the fill will be gone. And again, I think a lot of it it's going to depend on how much space can contractors put down in effectively Q4, but yeah, that's going to be the only issue, Courtney. And as I indicated before that the nice thing is you know what's going to go on top of the base at some point.
Courtney Yakavonis : Good. Thank you.
Ward Nye : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman : Hey. Great. Thank you. Good morning. Hey Ward, I just want to take a step back and thinking about your top 5 market, some of these labor constraints in supply deficiencies. Can you talk about which of those markets you've seen these issues most challenging and there are any markets in there that have been relatively insulated from that?
Ward Nye : I think the good news is, Brent, where if we look at our top markets which are going to be Texas, Colorado, now California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. They're all going to be pretty solid underlying economic markets and with most of those states having very high population inflows coming to them. And from our perspective, it's not so much an issue of supply. We're in a position to supply the materials, I think to your point, it's going to be more matter of labor.  And frankly, it's going to be a contractor timing perspective on when they're going to hire labor. One of the things that I'm at least defining on, Brent, is I think that's going to be one of the great collateral benefits from the highway bill on its best. Because when contractors have a sense that there are backlogs and their backlogs for a period of years are going to look very good. They're likely to hire, I think that's particularly true when we're looking at public works because public works, as you know, tend to come with liquidated damages if they're not finished in a timely manner.  But I think it's a practical matter that's going to be driving some of that. But again, if we look overall at the way our top states are positioned, they're positioned really well. If we're looking at TxDOT, their FY2022 lettings are set to exceed $10 billion. If we're looking at Colorado, they're looking at the DOT forecast that's up $850 million. NCDOT has returned to historical averages which puts them in a $5 billion a year budget. Georgia infrastructure look strong with additional $225 million of infrastructure investment. Florida is near record levels with very attractive backlogs.  But here's some of the things that are moved by -- you heard me mention Caltrans there budget, SB1 in the prepared remarks. But I didn't speak to our issues like SB9 and SBI0 in California that's allowing property owners to split single-family lots into 2 lots and streamlining of zoning or rezoning process. Because what we think that does in that market is it brings housing back in ways that that state hasn't seen for a while.  And as you recall [Indiscernible], from our analyst and Investor Day, so much goodness in heavy-side space tends to follow what's happening with single-family with a lag. If we see the highway bill, if we see the hiring that I think comes behind the highway bill, if we see the public work that I think we're going to see, and we continue to see that type of private work That's driven by revs. I think a lot of these supply chain and employee labor issues worked their way out. I don't think it's going to be immediate. And again, I think that's part of the government we've put on next year, but that's a long answer, but you asked a really good question and I think it has a lot of moving parts.
Brent Thielman : I appreciate that, the comment. Thanks Ward.
Ward Nye : Thank you, Brent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane BNP. Your line is open.
Paul Roger : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just changing -- actually a bit, maybe onto the sustainability agenda. There's a lot of talk around the minute about the circular economy and in particular using things like demolition waste instead of virgin aggregates. I guess it's a long-term question, but what impact do you think that could have on your volumes looking forward?
Ward Nye : No, Paul, thank you for your question very much. And Paul, I think that is something that we are cognizant enough that we're sensitive to I think in the fullness of time, recycle will play a bigger role than it's going to play in the next 5 or 10 years. And what do I mean by that? That I think we are going to go have to be looking to utilize recycled concrete more as a base product. I think we're going to be looking at higher degrees of recycled asphalt or RAP that used an asphalt mixes. Today, in many respects, you might see RAP in the, let's call it 20% portions of asphalt. I think you could see that going up into the 30% in the fullness of time. The primary driver of that being liquid, 1 reason I mentioned those 2 things in particular, Paul is if you look at the transactions at least 2 of the 3 that we've done this year, it's somewhat mindful of that.  If we're looking at the SCC Materials transaction that we did in July, That's basically buying a recycled business on concrete and selling that recycled concrete as an aggregate, and selling that in Houston, Texas where we have a significant presence and keep in mind part of what Tiller does for us in that marketplace -- I'm sorry, SCC is it adds a series of new yards for us. More specifically, it adds around 10 and we had a very attractive position in that marketplace with the existing rail yards that we had. So, to your point, it expands our footprint, but importantly, it adds new product offerings. Now similarly, if we look at the business that we've had in Minnesota at Tiller at the end of April, that's a stone business and it's a hot mix business, but it's not lay down business. So again, part of what that's going to allow us to do is to make sure that we're looking at percentages of [Indiscernible], how we're going to utilize that going forward. And the other piece of Tiller that I think has been important for us, is this part of that business we also picked up about a 100,000 tons worth of tank farm capacity in that marketplace, so we also have the ability to look at energy going forward in some modestly different ways with a fiscal hedge, because it allows us to hedge physically about 60% of our need for liquid in that relevant geographic market during the course of any one year. So, do we think we will see more recycle? Yes. Are we ourselves -- positioning ourselves to more of that? Yes. Do I think spec aggregates in the near-term are in any concern of being spec out of jobs? Absolutely not. I hope that helps Paul.
Paul Roger : Yeah, that [Indiscernible]. Just 1 very quick one, probably for Jim. I noticed you'd increase your capex guidance. Is that investment in Lehigh Hanson or is it something else? Just basically wondering how much capex Lehigh maybe needs going forward.
Jim Nickolas : That's right. You've got it exactly right, Paul. That is -- the amount -- that mass amount that we increased it in a new guidance versus the old guidance is due to the acquired assets Lehigh Hanson West.
Paul Roger : Great. Thank you.
Ward Nye : Thank you. Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thomson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Great quarter. Hey, Ward, I wanted to ask you high level about the residential market. Some of the national numbers show, I guess you'd call it may be a leveling off in the data, but I was curious what you're seeing under the surface.
Ward Nye : No look, that's such a great question. It goes back to a lot of what we spoke about at the Analyst Investor Day. So, I would say several things are worth knowing at least again, as we think about a Texas to Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now increasingly California. We came into this period of time in ARPU with remarkably underbuilt conditions, particularly with respect to single-family. We think the population dynamics will continue to be strong in those states. I mean, here's some specific color, if we're looking at Texas population growth, the residential section, at least for us in Texas is red hot. Texas comprises almost 9% of the U.S. population, but accounts for almost 34% of the country's population growth. And if we're looking at DFW, it's led the nation in the Metro growth for at least 4 years running.  And by the way, the Houston area's second. So, this is underscores again why we thought that move, that enhanced move in Texas is so important, in - housing is such a driver there. If we look in Colorado, the biggest issue that we have in Colorado is they frankly need more supply. The demand is there. Colorado population has grown 14% since 2010. So that's almost a million people. They gained the house (ph) seat in this last few population. So again, we can -- we anticipate continued strong housing growth in Colorado.  North Carolina just continues to grow dramatically. We see it here in our backyard every day between what's happening in Charlotte and in Raleigh, Durham. When I moved by North Carolina, I think this is important, is places like Greensboro, I think I might have mentioned early in the year, D.R. Horton has announced a plan to build 1,000 homes, single-families subdivision there in [Indiscernible] -- and the triad are up 28% year-over-year. So again, these are powerful numbers. If we're looking at Atlanta, the Atlanta single-family housing starts in our approaching 35,000. That's up on a trailing 12 basis, almost 38% but it's not just Atlanta, we're seeing that in Atlanta, we're seeing that in Savannah, and even in smaller markets like Augusta, that have continued to be very attractive. And even single-family housing in Florida and keep in mind that's really not the market that we're in there. We are a niche player in Florida in basically public transportation or infrastructure. But single-family housing in Florida is up 37% on trailing 12 months. And again, Florida has added 2.7 residences since 2010. So, if we look at those numbers, then come back and also lay on top of that those two different propositions that I spoke up just a few minutes ago relative to California. On SB9 and SBI0, if we are of the view that single-family housing is going to stay strong for a while and that aggregate tends to follow that with a very high correlative factor. And if we're assuming, this is what we think is going to happen. We think single-family stats in '21 go to about $1.2 million. We think in '22, they probably go to around 1.4 million and in '23 to about 1.5 million. Those are heady numbers but here's what's important to remember.  If we're right and they go to 1.2 million in 2021, that's 2,000 levels, and the U.S. has added 48 million people since then. If we're right, and then go to 1.4 million in ' 22, that's a 2,003 levels. And if we're right and it goes to 1.5 in '23, that's 2,003 and 2,004 levels. again, on a much higher population base. So, I've tried to give you some color around specific markets that matter to us. But I've also tried to give you some numbers broadly nationally that we think are relevant and we think are worth keeping in the back or front your mind.
Adam Thalhimer : Okay. Great color. Thanks, Ward.
Ward Nye : Adam, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. My question is on cement capacity. I think you're adding some finishing capacity in Texas. I think it's coming online in maybe 2 years. But how about Lehigh assets from a utilization standpoint and how are you contemplating the need, if at all, for additional capacity there?
Ward Nye : We're going -- that's part of what we're looking at very carefully right now. Clearly, they don't have to fest in California that we have in Texas. Right now, we've got a million ton more capacity in Texas, and obviously adding more at Midlothian. Part of what we're wanting to make sure right now is that we've got those facilities in California running optimally where they are. Our view is, we invest in the business once we know we've got it where it needs to be.  So, we're going through the capital process and looking at it very carefully as we speak. As Jim indicated earlier in his conversation with Paul, the increase in capex that you see is almost uniquely tied to what's going on at the Lehigh Hanson's West Region that we now have. And certainly, a significant portion of that is going to the Smith Business. Jim, anything you want to add to that?
Jim Nickolas : No, I think you've nailed it. It should be in line with what you've seen historically from us, our CapEx spend in total. So as our sales grow, including Lehigh Hanson business, our CapEx will grow commensurately. So, there should be no -- nothing unusual versus past history. Around 9% of sales is probably a good starting point to think about [Indiscernible] CapEx for us.
Garik Shmois : Okay, great. Thanks for the help.
Ward Nye : Thanks, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Citi, your line is open.
Andy Neri : Good morning.
Ward Nye : Good morning [Indiscernible]
Andy Neri : Ward, when you look at Lehigh and maybe Tiller, too, I understand you're excited about the opportunity. Are there any parts of the acquired businesses that might not be the best fit for Martin Marietta long term and then maybe going the other way. Are there opportunities for further acquisitions and '22 or should we really think of you as being heads down and deleveraging mode until you get to 2.5 or below 2.5 returns.
Ward Nye : Those are great questions. The thing that I would always say is where we've been. You further say that, if you were in an aggregate supply Company and that's the way we think about our businesses first. And so, I would always encourage you to remember that with us. At the same time, for example, could we go in and bought the business in Minnesota, that is the Tiller business. That does have a hot mix component to it, but part of what's so different about that is it doesn't have to lay down component to it.  So, if you think about really what I think makes Martin Marietta different from many, is we're not so much in the contracting business. We will take that stone in Minnesota in some respects, add liquid to it turn it into black pavement and sell it FOB at the facility. So, it's our number 1. Aggregate [Indiscernible] is the right way to think of us, 2. Being more focused on materials is the right way to think of u. Lastly, with respect to growing the business, Look, at the end of the transaction, clearly, our debt-to - EBITDA range is a little bit above 3 times.  As you know, we like to stay in the range of 2 to 2.5 times. We think that that's actually going to deleverage very nicely over the next year to 18 months. I think it's possible that if we get toward the end of next year, we could be back toward the high end of our range, that's really, I think doing great work can deleveraging the business. I think we have added immense value to this business by doing not acquisitions, but by doing the right acquisitions. By doing these transactions that we've done, we have opened up a series of new corridors.  And if you go back in time and you look at the way that we've grown our business, we have been focused uniquely on corridors of growth, whether it's I-95, I-85, Interstate 40, whether it's I-25 in Colorado and now increasingly on I-5 in California. So, aggregates [Indiscernible] the right way to think of us, a Company that wants to continue to do the right deals in the right markets is the right way to think of us and heavy-side oriented is where we will continue to reside, Anthony, so I hope that helps.
Andy Neri : That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.
Ward Nye : Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Wilson with Raymond James, your line is open?
Joshua Wilson : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Ward Nye : Sure, Josh.
Joshua Wilson : Just to clarify some of the moving parts on energy, can you give the change in the energy dollar headwind for the 2021 guidance?
Jim Nickolas : For the guidance, it was about $10 million for the old guidance to new guidance.
Joshua Wilson : $10 million incremental. Okay. Good. And then you talked about green shoots on light non-res, any signs of moderation or any concerns on the heavy non-res?
Ward Nye : No, not particularly. In fact, I would say not at all. The heavy non-res has continued to be really quite good and part of what I'm encouraged by, for example the energy portion of that has actually not been particularly good. So, it's been more driven by warehousing data, warehousing etc. As you may recall in some of the commentary I was sharing before, we're seeing more activity in West Texas on energy than we've seen for a while.  At the same time, for example, the Port Arthur LNG facility that's been on some degree of hold for a while, are saying respectfully is really anticipating some bid refreshing on that, in this quarter. And we may see some activity there as early as Q1 2022. Not a job that we'd want at this point but still, nonetheless, seeing that type of activity on heavy, we actually think is quite attractive, Josh.
Joshua Wilson : Great. I'll turn it back over.
Ward Nye : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Meeker with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David Meeker : Yes. Good morning, everyone. And great quarter, Ward. Congrats to the team.
Jim Nickolas : Yeah. Good morning.
Ward Nye : Thank you.
David Meeker : I guess I wanted to just ask about pricing here and, certainly, the outlook for 2022 is obviously very encouraging. But I guess I'm trying to understand what happened in Q3 and I fully appreciate the mix benefit or mix liability with the base stone and the excess fill material. But you're attracting a 3.4% coming through the first half and you dropped out at 2.2 on organic basis, so I'm hoping you can give us some sense of what organic growth and pricing might have looked like excluding the base stone, the excess fill material, and -- just start with that if you would, please.
Ward Nye : Yeah. Now, look quick answers. We've been very comfortably in those zones that we talked about earlier. And I think when, again, David, if it's 900 -- if it's almost a million tons of fill, and fill largely looked at broadly as almost a waste product. Obviously, we sold it for profit because we didn't have it on the books for anything, but it is a fill product. And if you're looking at what was a fairly significant movement on base, particularly in that Raleigh market, Of all the things that I worry at night about, aggregate pricing is not on my list.  Those -- purely simply those are the drivers. The other thing and I know your question were on organic, but I do think it's important to keep in mind when you look at it all rolled up. Stone pricing in the acquired Tiller operations are about $5 a ton lower than our Heritage number. So again, when you do an all-in number with that, it's clearly has optically a dilutive effect. And then when you feather in nearly a million tons of funds, again, it will have an optical effect. But I think to your point, the mid-years, I think really did underscore the strength of the market. And to give you a sense of what we saw in the East Division, this really means in the Carolinas, was a bucket ton up on clean stone effective July 1 and even $0.50 on base effective July 1. And then Southwest, we saw in North Texas up $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1.  In Austin, up a bucket ton and in Hunter Stone, which is in New Braunfels, $0.50 to up a bucket ton, and then in Garwood up a bucket ton on August 1. So, I think all those at least in the way that I'm watching it and measuring the cadence, David, gives me a high degree of confidence in what we're anticipating next year that and probably more importantly together with conversations we've had with our customers. So, I hope that helps.
David Meeker : Yeah. So just to be clear, as you look at that organic number excluding the base stone in the excess fill material, you're saying that pricing would have been up sequentially excluding those items, but your price [Indiscernible] up sequentially.
Ward Nye : Yes, it would.
David Meeker : And was there anything different in terms of the initial third quarter attraction rates on these third quarter price increases that -- Just comparing that with prior price increases, is there anything that was maybe different this time?
Ward Nye : No, not really. The only thing that I would say is probably consistent this time is whenever you do a midyear, you're only going to actually see a very limited portion of those go in the year and what inputs you put it. I mean, historically, what I would've said, if you did a mid-year truly on July 1 or June 30, if you got 20% or 25% of it in the year in which you put it in, you'd be fortunate. So really, it's more of a play into the following year.
David Meeker : Great. Good. Thanks very much. That's all I got.
Ward Nye : Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye : Shana (ph) thank you so much and thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. To conclude our strong third quarter results underpinned by our record-setting safety, operational and financial performance, reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's opportunities to soar to a sustainable future and maximize stakeholder value. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results in February as always, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy. Good bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta’s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta’s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today’s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. We’ve made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2021 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Ward Nye will begin today’s earnings call with a discussion of our second quarter operating performance and market trends as well as our recently announced acquisition. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results after which Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. I’ll now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne and thank you all for joining today’s teleconference. Martin Marietta has once again reported impressive results extending our strong track record of industry-leading performance and responsible growth. We delivered record profitability and the best safety performance in our company’s history to the first half of the year. We’re also making notable progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further enhance our ability to capitalize on growing construction activity and favorable pricing dynamics in the post-pandemic landscape. We’re confident about Martin Marietta’s prospects for the remainder of 2021. In May, we announced an agreement to acquire Lehigh Hanson’s West Region. Those of you who joined us early this year for our Investor Day, we’re likely not surprised when you read the announcement. The acquisition, which is consistent with and advances SOAR 2025 provides a new upstream materials led platform in three of the Western United States largest and fastest growing mega regions. With this leading Pacific presence will be well positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona, as well as continued private sector growth across these regions. This strategic acquisition also provides Martin Marietta with an enhanced coast-to-coast geographic footprint and serves as a viable platform for potential continued geographic expansion. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021 following customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Lehigh West Region team to Martin Marietta. We’re also very pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Tiller operations in the Minneapolis St. Paul region, which exceeded management’s initial expectations since closing on April 30. Tiller contributed one million tons each of aggregates and asphalt during May and June, and provides Martin Marietta, an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest growing Midwestern metropolitan areas, while also expanding and complementing our product offerings in our existing operations and surrounding markets. Integration into our central division is underway and synergy realization is progressing as planned. This business remains on track to contribute $60 million of adjusted EBITDA this year. Martin Marietta has established a long track record of superior value creation by prudently balancing inorganic growth opportunities, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our latest acquisitions and successful growth initiatives demonstrate that SOAR and our discipline capital deployment strategy continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders, positioning our company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. Now let’s turn to the company’s second quarter performance. We achieved record second quarter revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share, driven by strengthening product demand, pricing gains across all product lines, and meaningful contributions from the recently acquired Tiller acquisition. On a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 9% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% to $393 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $439 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $3.81. Our Building Materials business continued to benefit from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment, and heavy industrial projects of scale. Adverse weather however, muted shipments, most notably in our top two revenue generating states are aggregates cement, and ready-mixed concrete operations in Texas, experienced lower than expected shipment levels as a result of excessive rainfall. In fact, the second quarter was Texas’s 11th wettest on record. Additionally, Colorado home to our Front Range aggregates and downstream operations surpassed average annual precipitation levels during the first half of the year. Second quarter aggregate shipments increased 1.5% on an organic basis and 3% in total. East Group total shipments grew 7% strong demand across all end use markets in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland combined with shipments from the acquired Tiller operations, more than offset lower shipments in the Midwest from weather induced project delays. West Group shipments declined nearly 4% as Mother Nature interrupted otherwise robust construction activity in both Texas and Colorado. Organic aggregates average selling price increased over 3% supported by our value over volume pricing strategy led by the East Group. Geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher priced long-haul shipments limited West Group’s reported pricing gains on a mix adjusted basis, West Group pricing increased 2.4%. We announced mid-year price increases in a number of markets, which should further contribute to favorable pricing trends heading into next year. Our Texas Cement business delivered solid operating performance, despite significant precipitation that disrupted more than one-third of the quarter’s available shipping days. Second quarter shipments declined less than 2%. As major projects in South Texas, along with recovering energy sector activity helped mitigate weather impacts. Notably, we established an all time record for monthly cement shipments in June, largely due to the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Second quarter cement pricing increased 7% or 4% on a mix adjusted basis, as annual increases went into effect on April 1. Additionally, we’ve announced the second price increase of $8 per ton on September 1 for both North and South Texas. This represents the first midyear increase since 2014. Attractive demand drivers continued market tightness, and diversified customer backlogs will support sustainable construction activity and pricing for our Texas Cement operations over the next several years. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mixed concrete shipments increased to 8% despite significant weather headwinds driven by incremental volume from large non-residential projects and operations acquired last year in Texas. Concrete pricing increased modestly reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower priced Texas shipments. Overall asphalt shipments increased 68% driven by contributions from the Tiller operations, which more than offset weather related shipment declines in our Colorado asphalt and paving business. Colorado market fundamentals remain strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta is attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long term secular demand trends across our three primary end-used markets will drive increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2021 and into the future. Demand for our construction products has grown. And we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contractor labor and supply shortages compounded by weather differ days that become increasingly difficult to recover is the year advances can govern the near term pace of overall construction activity. Fortunately, we expect work not completed this year to simply be pushed into 2022 and foresee bottlenecks like these moderating and throughput improving as federal unemployment benefits expire in September. We’re also in the midst of the most significant seemingly bipartisan national infrastructure debate in a long time, with a number of proposals from both political parties to advance and address much needed investment. Regardless of the pathway to success or infrastructure legislation all proposals provide for sizeable increases in federal surface transportation funding over the fixing America’s surface transportation, or FAST Act. We’re optimistic that meaningful progress in Washington DC will be made and a FAST Act replacement will be passed before its expiration in September. Such legislation would immediately stimulate economic growth, contractor optimism and job creation, while also driving meaningful product demand starting in late 2022 and beyond. Our company’s top five States Department of Transportation or DOTs are well positioned to put increased transportation dollars to work more specifically, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues have an abundance of projects in their backlog that would benefit from higher federal funding and generate growing demand for our products. At the same time, increased visibility and funding certainty of the federal level supports a healthy pricing environment for construction materials. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of second quarter shipments well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We’re also beginning to see early signs of recovery in the more COVID-19 impacted wide commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Denver, Atlanta, and the Texas triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022 given the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 36% of second quarter shipments. Martin Marietta continues to be a beneficiary of single-family housing growth across the southeast and southwest. Single-family starch remains strong despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times supported by significant under building over the past decade, low mortgage rates and accelerated the urbanization trends. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of second quarter shipments. I’ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our second quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas : Thanks, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted products and services revenues of $1.2 billion a 7% increase from last year’s second quarter and product gross profit of $357 million. Aggregates established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit, higher diesel costs and a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting are reflected in product gross margin of 34%. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.8% a 70 basis point decline versus prior year. In addition, gross profit per ton shipped, improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. So net product gross margin declined 870 basis points despite top-line growth, driven by the timing and scope of planned kill maintenance, as well as higher energy and raw material costs. While our first half results were impacted by some weather related headwinds, our cement business is well positioned benefit from a growing demand and tight supply. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 7%, a shipment and pricing gains were offset the higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million a 43% increase, revenue growth more than offset higher energy costs for energy and contract services, driving a 260 basis point improvement in product gross margin to 39.9%. On a consolidated basis, earnings from operations included more than $9 million of acquisition related costs, as well as a $12 million gain on the sale of property. This gain is non-recurring in nature and should not be extrapolated for run rate purposes. Relative to often cited broader economic questions regarding supply chain and inflation. We are pleased that our overall supply chain remains resilient with only a handful of indications of strain for some suppliers. On the cost inflation front, the only notable headwinds we have seen are from increased energy costs. For the second quarter alone, our total energy costs increased $24 million companywide. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted margins would have outpaced prior year, a testament to our team’s commitment to cost control and operational excellence. We remain focused on the discipline execution of our proven strategy and our long standing capital allocation priorities that preserve our healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment grade credit rating profile. As Ward noted, we continue to balance value enhancing inorganic growth opportunities with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $450 million to $500 million as you prioritize high return capital projects focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As of June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times. In late June, we access the capital markets to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction issuing $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and weighted average tenure of 15 years. The bond sale settled in early July, and as such is not reflected in our second quarter results. We expect pro forma leverage at year end to be above our target range. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt, following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times within 18 months following the closing of the transaction. As detailed in today’s release, we’ve updated our full year guidance to reflect current expectations, the completion of the Tiller acquisition and the $2.5 billion bond offering. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.465 billion to $1.535 billion. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we’re proud of our record first half results and industry-leading safety performance and remain highly confident in our outlook for the balance of 2021. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity, both in the near and long-term. As we soar to a sustainable future, our focus remains on building the safest, best performing and most sustainable aggregates lead public company, thanks to our disciplined execution of SOAR, commitment to safe and efficient operations and our dedication to both commercial and operational excellence. Today Martin Marietta is superbly positioned. We’re confident in Martin Marietta’s ability to deliver sustainable growth and superior shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, you mentioned the strong pricing environment on the summit side in the $8 increase yield coming in September. Can you talk about what you’re seeing on the aggregate side as well, and then also some of the downstream businesses?
Ward Nye: No, happy too, Stanley. Good morning and nice to hear your voice. So, you’re right September one is going to be an important date in cement. We’re taking that pricing up as you indicated $8 a ton. But as we also indicated during it when we were at the end of the first quarter, we thought we would see more mid-year price increases than we’ve seen in years past. That’s entirely what’s happening. If we’re looking on the aggregate side first and look at our East Division, we’re looking in a number of places for $1 a ton on clean stone, $0.50 a ton on based on all effective July 1. So that’s something that that we put into effect. But equally, we’re looking at aggregate price increases mid-year in the southwest division. So for example, in North Texas, and for purposes of this read Dallas-Fort Worth, we’re looking at $0.50 to $0.75 of time on September 1. In Austin, we’re looking more at $1 a ton on August 1. At Hunter Stone, which was one of those sound centers Houston TX, where we have the quarry in conjunction with a cement plant in New Braunfels. We’re looking $0.50 to $1 a ton on August 1 and a Garwood down just outside Houston, Sand Gravel facility looking at $1 a ton there. So that’s what we’re seeing on the stone side of it. Now equally, and I think this is important, Stanley. We’re looking for that also in readymix, particularly in Texas. So, we’re looking for ranges anywhere from $4, a cubic yard in Austin, and in East Texas, up to $6 a cubic yard in North Texas. So, if we think about what we’re seeing in mid years, we’re seeing it in aggregates, we’re seeing it in the east, we’re seeing it in the southwest. We’re seeing it in cement and our uniquely Texas business today. And we’re also seeing in readymix in Texas. So again, the type of backdrop that we anticipated, we will see Stanley I’m happy to report that to you.
Stanley Elliott: That’s great. And secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the inflation side that you saw in the summit? My guess is some of the maintenance is not a whole lot last year and kind of a normal cadence this year, but any other thing to call out? And then I guess one other thing, any update on the additional grinding capacity or expansion that you all had thought about earlier in the year there?
Ward Nye: Yes. So what I’ll say relative to the grinding capacity again, that’s something that we’re finishing that we’ll be adding to Midlothian. So you’ll hear more about that as we go into 2022. Again, that’s a market that we believe simply needs that. With respect to the maintenance in cement, you’re exactly right, if you think back to 2020. Part of what we indicated coming into 2021 is that we would spend more in cement maintenance. In fact, we had indicated to the market early on, that we thought we would spend about $6 million more on kiln and finish mill outages in 2021 than we did in 2020. And really Q2 was the time to do that. So if you’re looking at the delta, on what we did last year in Q2, and what we did this year in Q2, on cement maintenance, it was about $7.3 million difference. So, we spent that much more in Q2 than we did last year. So in other words, that full annual difference that we had anticipated that you should expect. We pretty much did that in Q2. So what we’re expecting is a very comparable smooth run here in the second half of the year. And frankly, we’re expecting better margins in that business in the second half of the year as a consequence.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Thank you all for the time. Best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Thompson: Thank you for taking my question today. It’s a little bit into the previous question. Could you provide a stair step in terms of the guidance update in terms of puts and takes in terms of good guys bad guys? And then layering and on the price increases? What would have margins then excluding some of the costs from energy that you outlined? And how do these margins really play into the back half of the year and really into 2022 from a margin profile? Thank you.
Ward Nye: No, you bet Kathryn. So several things. Let’s talk about the margin piece at first, because as Jim indicated, in his commentary and there was prepared, energy was up $24 million for the quarter. So I mean, that’s a big number. And if we look at diesel fuel all by itself that was up almost $15 million. So, if we go and look at our diesel fuel usage that was a little bit over 12 and million gallons, excuse me a diesel fuel up about $1.11 per gallon. So if we go and pull that energy piece of it out and look at the margins, actually, what you’ll see on the margins across the enterprise is that adjusted gross margins actually improved over Q2, 2020. What that tells me, Kathryn is the underlying performance of the cost side of the business is actually doing extraordinarily well. So, what I’m pleased with is the underlying cost is doing well. And we’re seeing the price move forward in a way that we thought that we would particularly as the economy continues to improve. Now, with respect to your question on guidance, in particular, you’re right, some had some things moving around one, we did just drop in what we had indicated verbally before, and that was we expect $60 million of EBITDA contribution from the acquired Tiller operations. Equally, if we’re looking at our cement business that has noted for intended, whether the deep freeze in Texas in February and then as we indicated an extraordinarily wet Q2. We’ve taken cement down a little bit and of course, readymix is going to follow that so we pulled that down a little bit. And asphalt and paving in Colorado had a very challenging year-over-year or so we pulled those down. But we’ve equally taken Magnesia Specialties, backup. So those are some of the broader puts and takes that we have, if we look overall at the pricing, we’ve really not changed price. And we’ve kept that very consistent with where we thought, keep in mind the mid years that we’re putting in will not affect pricing that much this year is setting the stage even more robustly for 2022. And we did pull aggregate volume down just a hair in large measure. We’re just looking at the days left in the year. It’s not an indication of any lack of robustness in the market. At some point, today’s just get shorter. So Kathryn, I hope that answers your series of questions.
Kathryn Thompson: It does. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the lines of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jatin Khanna: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Jatin Khanna on behalf of Jerry Revich. Our questions around aggregate pricing, the midpoint of heritage pricing guidance implies about 5% organic pricing in the second half, was about 3% in the first half is that the extent to which you expect pricing to accelerate based on media prices increases? And also, what would have had to happen to hit the high end of the guidance range. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about volume guidance in the second half, whether it’s implying is basically about a 4% increase in volume in the second half. And you’re right, what we’re anticipating is we’re going to see some accelerating pricing. A number of the things that we seen during the first half of the year that I think is important is we’ve seen considerably more bass work than we have before. I think that’s actually good, because as you may recall, base work ends up turning into finished work on top of that. So you’re going to see several things. One, we believe North Carolina, Georgia, and the East will continue to perform actually quite well. If you’re looking overall at the volume. And again, the volume is going to have some degree of impact on ASP if you think about geographic mix. The East Group in the first half was up 7%, excluding, Tiller, it was up 4%. But it’s important to note that Tiller’s pricing is about 30%, lower than heritage, Martin Marietta. So that actually gave us a modest headwind. So if we’re looking at what I think will be more clean stone sales most likely in the second half of the year have continued good performance in the East. And in some instances, we were selling some products that were in reserve. And typically those tend to go for a relatively lower average selling price. I think it does back in triangulating around the number that you had indicated. And yes, we continue to have good confidence around that in the back half of the year.
Jatin Khanna: Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, if you look at, the guidance again, digging into that just a little bit more. You talked about the energy costs that were obviously present, probably not going to change any talked about some pricing, obviously that follows that you guys are putting in place. Ward you also mentioned that it will be probably more next year before this pricing really starts to impact, so as we look at the back half, your margins were impacted in 2Q. But I think Kathryn asked the question earlier, but maybe a little bit different angle on the back half margins as we looked through the balance of the year. How are we looking at, the price versus some of these energy impacts that you’re seeing, and then how that flows through relative to what we saw in the 2Q?
Ward Nye: Well, I think you clearly will get some benefit from mid years in the second half. Now, the fact is, most of that, as we discussed, rate is going to play more into next year. I think the other thing that we saw a bit in the first half is we did see a bit more maintenance and repair. And some of that was tied in to the acquisition activity as well. So we think that’s going to moderate itself. So I think that’s clearly going to come back and help on the margin piece of it. I think the other thing is, if we simply look at what was happening in Texas, and in Colorado, it’s difficult to be as efficient as you want to be when you’re dealing with those high degrees of rainfall as well. So we’re entering a period of time that typically is drier, we’re entering a period of time that some of the mid years will play in, we’re entering a period of time where I think we’re going to see more clean stone going relative to base. And I think we’re entering a period of time, that you’re likely to see less maintenance and repair because in many respects, people are simply blowing and going in Q3. So, I think you take that combination of factors, I think it comes back and addresses some of the margin questions I’ll turn to my colleague, Mr. Nickolas, and he has anything he wants to add to that, Trey.
Jim Nickolas: Sure. Thanks Trey, happy too. One notable thing and energy is our own guidance committee new guidance, we’ve increased energy expense by $34 million. And despite that, your margin question our incremental for the year, once the year is all said and done, we’re expecting 50% incremental margins, still the accurate side despite that heavier energy expense. So by and large, we’re very happy with where things are ending up. And just to put in perspective, 2021 to energy expense and diesel, while higher versus last year, it’s pretty much in line with what we saw in 2019. So for us, this is not much of a stretch to kind of keep putting and good margins in.
Trey Grooms: Great got, and thanks for clarifying some of that stuff. That was just some questions that getting in the weeds was definitely helpful. Thank you. And then if I could sneak one in just on the big picture, because you did mention it on the bipartisan bill. I mean, this is kind of surprising, I think, to some that we’re seeing the folks in Washington actually, look like there may be coming together on something here. But, just a given kind of where they’ve outlined funds for street and highway and bridge, and other things. Which I think the bridge piece might have been taken up a little bit. But I’d love to get your thoughts on this version of the bill Ward, and maybe what it could mean longer term for Martin Marietta?
Ward Nye: Look, thanks for the question very much on that. And obviously, we’re all watching what happened in the Senate last night? I guess the good news is I’m not sure that here we were that surprised by so look, based on the way that we see it. It’s that overall proposal, trillion dollars, five years $550 billion in new spending. And really, if we’re looking at roads and bridges Trey, that’s going to be by our math, about $110 billion, that’s going to be around $39 billion for public transport, another $66 billion for rail, and keep in mind with the largest balance producer in the country, $25 billion for airports and about $17 billion for ports. So, I mean, that’s going to be a lot of work. What does that mean? Overall? I think it means several things. One, its recognition that it’s overdue. Number two, it’s a recognition that at least from our perspective, Trey, and you heard in prepared remarks. Having watched this business for a long time in this industry for a long time, typically 40 some percent of our products is finding its way to highways, bridges, roads and streets. And we’ve been in the 30s for the last several years. And that’s really evidence of the fact that there’s not been the level of investment at the federal level that was needed. So if we’re looking simply the senate bipartisan plan, and we’re looking at what that means from a percentage up from baseline, FY 2021 appropriations and invest, it’s up about 46% from the baseline. So this is not a trifling number. And what I really liked about it, too, is if you look at the vote last night on basically the closure motion, what you’re going to find is 67 senators voted for this, and among them was Mitch Mcconnell. And so when we start looking at where Senate leadership is, and who really came along to move that vote along, it was some pretty notable players. And the other thing that I think is important is obviously the pay for us are going to matter. And this and when we look at the pay for us at least, how they’ve been pulled together in the senate version, you’ve got a lot of repurpose, COVID relief that’s going into this. You’ve got some unused unemployment insurance that’s going into it. And then obviously, they’re going to be looking at it degrees of economic growth that’s going to be derived from the program’s investment. In other words, dynamic scoring, that’s also going to be a piece of it. So the fact that it got that degree of a vote that it got that type of support from senators [indiscernible] Senator Portman is an McConnell. We think it’s important and we think it helps put the industry in attractive place, not just from an infrastructure perspective going forward. But we believe residential is going to remain strong. We think heavy non-res is going to remain strong, and we think res is going to inflect. That light portion of non-res. Long story short, we think this bill, if it’s pushed forward into law, and we believe it will be before the FAST Act expires, puts the industry in a very attractive place for a multiyear run trend.
Trey Grooms: That’s great color. Thanks for the thoughts there Ward and take care. Thank you.
Ward Nye: You bet. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phil Ng: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ward this second round of price increase, you called out for aggregates in the East in Texas, I believe. Anyway, to kind of put that into context. What’s driving that is that more tightness in supply, demand versus inflation. And if it’s more tight market conditions, we want to get a little flavor, and how broad basis this potentially as we kind of look out to next year? And if that’s the framework, should we expect, noticeable step up from, the 3% to 5% pricing we’ve seen in the last few years?
Ward Nye: Phil, that’s a great question. And I would submit to you it’s not so much driven by tightness right now. I think it’s driven more by what is anticipated; I think is driven by a much higher degree of confidence. If we’re looking at the condition of most DOTs in the East States, DOTS are actually in a very, very good place. For example, if we look at where North Carolina Department Transportation is, I mean, their financial issues are very much in the past with 22 lettings a $2.7 billion. That’s up. I mean, if you can imagine 260% from the prior year. So if we’re looking at what’s happening relative to homebuilding in these markets, if we’re looking at what’s going on with respect to infrastructure, if we’re looking at a very healthy non-res environment as well in the East, it all looks very, very attractive, whether that’s going to be in North Carolina, or Georgia or South Carolina or Florida as well. The other thing that I think is really telling is when we pause and take a look at the backlogs and backlogs are always something funny in this industry because it’s a practical matter. They usually represent only around 25% or 35% of annual aggregates and cement going forward. But it does give you a good dipstick into the tank to get a sense of where things are. And total aggregates backlogs is pretty attractive. It’s around 13% ahead a prior year levels. So again, if we’re going back to the notion of overall contractor competence, if we’re looking at it, people who are going to be busy and they know they’re going to be busy, and then seeing broadly an overall inflationary market in a lot of different respects. It’s actually a very appropriate and opportune moment for us to make sure that we’re getting the value for a spec material that not everybody can put on the ground.
Phil Ng: That’s super helpful. And sorry to sneak one in. You mentioned you’re starting to see some improvement in like commercial any color on how trends have progressed the last few quarters are you starting to see shipments flattened out a little bit. Any color on the bidding activity be helpful as well.
Ward Nye: Though, we that’s a great point, we clearly are starting to see better activity on white non-res I mean, If we’re looking Colorado, I mean, clearly office retail and hospitality is looking for a stronger inflection in half, two, if we’re looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, it’s been fairly fascinating to watch I mean retail and hospitality are both already beginning to inflect. And we’re starting to see strong corporate reloads here. Population trends are following that. We’ve got Apple and Google making significant investments here. And again, as we’re looking at markets like Florida, office, hotel, retail, and industrial activity in that marketplace actually continues to really be quite strong. A lot of what’s driving it and look we get. The U.S. is added since 2000, over 48 million people in population. And what that’s doing is it’s driving, what we’re seeing now in single family housing and then single family housing is driving what we’re starting to see but basically the way that we thought we would during analyst Investor Day, here is we go into half to fill. So I hope that helps.
Phil Ng: Yes, super up. Good luck on the quarter, guys.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Garik Shmois: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned that Tiller is the first couple months of ownership outperforming your expectations and just kind of curious as to what’s driving that. And then also, if I heard your right, you said Tiller pricing is about four points below the corporate average. So can you speak to perhaps the commercial synergy opportunity there?
Ward Nye: No happy to number one, we’re thrilled to have Tiller as part of this organization, culturally and otherwise they have wonderfully for us, you’ve heard what I said in the prepared remarks. Basically, in May and June, they sold a million tons of aggregates and a million tons of hot mix. By the way, I think their history that’s the fastest they’ve ever gotten to that million tons in hot mix. I think what you’re seeing is several things one, the Minneapolis St. Paul market is a good healthy Midwest market, it tends to be very steady. We’re seeing good activity there. We talked before about the fact that Minneapolis St. Paul actually consumes more tons of aggregates in hot mix on a per annum basis, than even Charlotte does, which is a premier market here. So again, I think from a timing perspective, and from a market perspective, and putting their business together with ours, in that important market to us, the timing was good, the operational synergies are going to be real. We have a lot that we can learn from each other there. Tiller is extraordinarily good. On the asphalt side, they are already teaching us things that we can take from that. I think we can help them on the aggregate side. But I will tell you, they are very good on the aggregate side. So again, if we’re looking at margins in that business, they tend to start with a three. So again, I think everything that we were hoping that we would see in that transaction is come through. Yes, the other thing that’s happening too is they have some very attractive real estate that they’ve been able to sell, we’ve been able to sell. That actually takes the overall purchase price paid for the business and pulls it down, actually very nicely. So, I’m happy to report to you, Garik, there’s nothing about that transaction, that as you might be able to glean from my commentary that we’re not gushing about right now. So, we’re very pleased with it, and think they’re great things to come.
Garik Shmois: Great. Thanks again.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Michael Dudas: Hi, good morning, gentlemen.
Ward Nye: Hey, Mike.
Michael Dudas: Maybe you share some thoughts on a very good performance on Specialties Magnesia. Pretty impressive at times it appears like in the U.S. steel market and certainly demand for the products and chemicals going around the world. What are your managers – are they – is there some sustainability to this very cyclical? Is there going to be maybe more of a sustainable aspect to what the business could be like and maybe looking in next couple years out? Or is it just a cyclical pop here that the markets will dictate a little bit even though we’re having some strong tightness in those downstream markets?
Ward Nye: Number one, thanks for the question. Because that’s an extraordinary business, it does not get the airtime that it is earned and it deserves. So, what I would say is several things, what you’re seeing in the business this quarter isn’t so much an unusual pop. This is more like returning to usual for that business. So, if we think about what was happening globally, last year, this time, steel was in a very challenging place. Overseas chemicals was in a challenging place, because in many respects, markets were closed. So, if we go back to June of 2020, steel was running at about 55% capacity, today it’s running at around 83%. So that’s a good healthy number. Everything that we’re seeing in that market tells us that we expect that business to run strong and remain strong, certainly for the rest of this year. The other thing that we’re seeing is cobalt. And that ends up being an important market for us overseas is up 52% since the end of 2020. So, when we’re looking at how the business is performing on steel, where it’s performing relative to its chemicals business all that’s really quite good. And here’s what’s even more impressive, because if you keep in mind, energy has actually been going up during much of this year. Keep in mind that is a large count driven business in portions of it, both in Woodville and in Manistee. And typically as nat gas goes, it can have a profound effect, why not have profound effects a notable effect on the way that business is operating. And basically what we’re seeing is their ability to manage their costs extraordinarily well. They continue to get good pricing. And we believe that business back to the essence of your question is in fact very, very durable, Mike. So, we expect continued great things from Mag Specialties. But again, thank you for the question.
Michael Dudas: No, that’s excellent. Well said, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Joe Nolan: Hi, this is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. I’m actually going to give Magnesia Specialties a little more airtime here. Just wondering about capacity availability in that business, just wondering if you’re approaching constraints and if so you have any intention to invest in growth of new capacity? Or would you rather pursue de-bottlenecking increments just any details there?
Ward Nye: Yes, that’s a great question. And there can’t be enough Magnesia Specialties loss. So thank you for brought to the question. That is the business that in many respects is running at capacity right now. And we’ve recognized that so much of what that business is doing is several folds. One is looking for ways to de-bottleneck and run things more efficiently. Number two, it continues to look at its product mix, and will continue to drive more of what it’s doing to its higher margin products. They’ve had a great history of doing that. I’m sure they have a very bright future of doing that as well. Part of that so difficult about that business, and it’s one of the great things about the business is we produce 24% of the dolomitic lime in North America from our facility at Woodville and opening permitting and otherwise, the dolomitic lime plant is very costly, it is very time consuming. Both our facilities in Manistee and in Woodville have title five operating permits, they operate very, very efficiently. So adding more capacity is something that it’s very difficult, we’re always looking for responsible ways to grow the business. But I think in the near term, what you can anticipate is de-bottlenecking, focusing on higher margin products. And at the end of the day, we’re going to be focused on pricing in that business just as we are in the aggregates in cement business. So Joe, I hope that helps.
Joe Nolan: Very helpful. Thanks. And if I could just sneak another quick one in on North Carolina, if you could just talk about the growth you’re seeing in that market and how much of that may be state spending versus private sector construction and also just the extent to which you feel that pattern will continue in 2022? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Yes, no, happy too. As I’ve indicated our FY 2022 learning’s just looking at NCDOT for a second are increasing 260%. So I mean, clearly, DOT in a much different, very healthy place right now. Keep in mind, that’s an overall DOT with an annual budget around $5 billion. So that’s on the public side. If we look on the non-res, I would say several things. If you think about North Carolina really working from the middle of the state to a little bit farther west, you end up in Raleigh Durham. Then you farther west of Greensboro, high point Winston Salem into Charlotte, all markets in which we have leading positions. So, if I think about what’s going on in Charlotte, for example, from a non-res perspective, Charlotte continues to be a significant beneficiary of a lot of warehousing activity. You’ve got I-77, I-85, and a host of large thoroughfares that are coming together in what’s effectively the capital of the Carolinas, if you think about it. What’s important too is in places like Greensboro in the Triad again, we’re seeing good warehouse and we’re seeing good medical and surprisingly healthy retail activity there. But here’s part of what I think is driving that. So for example, D.R. Horton recently announced their plans to build a 1000 homes subdivision in Greensboro. What I’m going to suggest to you Joe, if you go back in time and listen to the last time I was talking about somebody building 1000 homes subdivision in the Triad, it’s been a while. So the fact is, if you’re seeing that type of single-family housing growth in the Triad, you’re going to continue to see good non-res activity. And I spoke just a few minutes ago about what’s happening here in the Raleigh Durham area, with Apple with Google with generally what’s happening in the Research Triangle Park. And keep in mind, when you’ve got North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill and Duke University in Durham, you’ve got three large universities that tend to drive a lot of economic activity, and you got state government here. And so this is an area that in good times does extraordinarily well, in more challenging times. You’re not going to say it’s recession proof, but it’s pretty close. So those are the types of things that we’re seeing in North Carolina, Joe.
Joe Nolan: Thanks. I’ll pass it on. 
Ward Nye: Thank you. Take care of rest of the day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Josh Wilson: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Ward Nye: You bet, Josh. 
Josh Wilson: Wanted to clarify the pricing commentary that you gave in aggregates are those mid-year price increases include in the guidance or a potential source of upside, depending on how quickly they gain traction?
Ward Nye: Well, we’ve done our best to make those and as a practical matter of what you’re doing, Josh is you are protecting people who already have prices from you, as a general rule, what I would tell you is you’re going to recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase, if in fact, you’re putting them in at mid-year in the year that they’re baked in. So that’s how I’ve asked you to think about those, in many respects, the mid-years that I outlined for you on aggregates, at least in the East were effective on July 1. Now, keep in mind, when I went through those different portions of the Southwest, most of those were effective on August 1, somewhere effective September 1. So we’ve done our best to bake that into what we have, but it can be a little bit elusive at times.
Josh Wilson: And just to sneak one other in on summit, there’s no maintenance differences in the rest of the year, then either good or bad?
Ward Nye: The balance of the year ought to be a pretty smooth run, because as I think I indicate in conversation with Stanley. We had indicated there was going to be a vast $6 million delta more in 2021 than there was in 2020. And again, we had outlined the fact that in Q2, the maintenance costs were up about $7.3 million.
Josh Wilson: Thanks, good luck with the next one.
Ward Nye: All right, very good. Thank you so much. Take care, Josh.
Ward Nye: And again, thank you all for joining today’s earnings call. We’ll continue to focus on maximizing value for shareholders as we build on our strong results and continue executing on our SOAR 2025 plan. We look forward to sharing our third quarter of 2021 results in a few months. As always, we’re available for any follow up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and your continued support Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy. We’ll speak to you soon.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.

Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. As evidenced by our first quarter results and successful targeted growth initiatives, it's clear that Martin Marietta is off to an impressive start in 2021. Thanks to the company's differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review plan, what we refer to as SOAR, we remain well positioned for continued success. As we look to the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we expect to build on a track record of strong financial, operational, integrated and safety performance. Supported by our team's steadfast commitment to safe and efficient operations, price discipline and operational excellence, we established first quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. Both building materials and magnesia specialties benefited from strengthening product demand. Specifically, consolidated products and services revenues increased 3% to $922 million, consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased of 37% to $204 million and diluted earnings per share grew over 2.5 times to $1.04. We also achieved the best first quarter safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding or trending at world class levels. At the same time, we are thoughtfully executing on our SOAR growth priorities to enhance our geographic footprint and grow our business. As announced in this morning's release, we successfully completed the acquisition of Tiller Corporation the leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis St. Paul region and welcomed more than 200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team. Tiller provides an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the Midwest and expands and complements the product offerings of our existing operations in surrounding markets. Tillers cultural fit, attracted margins and value over volume operating philosophy directly aligned with our central division operations. We expect a seamless and successful integration. Now let's turn to the company's first quarter operating performance. The Building Materials business saw strengthening product demand from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale in our key geographies. Our aggregates, Cement and ready mixed concrete business in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state experienced temporary disruptions from February's historic winter ice storm and sub freezing temperatures. Additionally, our aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, our second largest state by revenues, faced a challenging comparison as our results in the same period last year, benefited from unseasonably favorable weather conditions in the Rocky mountains. Overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, in line with our expectations, given return to typical first quarter seasonality factors and the largely non-COVID-19 impacted prior year quarter. Notably, East Group aggregate shipments increased as the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, benefited from strong residential and heavy industrial nonresidential activity. This growth offset lower shipments in the Midwest from more seasonal construction activity and reduced wind energy projects. While underlying product demand remains robust, unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and a softer energy sector market resulted in an 8% decline in West group shipments. Aggregates average selling price increased 3.4% or 2.5% on a mix adjusted basis. These pricing gains supported by our locally driven pricing strategy, highlight contractor confidence and underlying construction activity in the attractive markets that we serve. East Group pricing increased 4% with both East and Central divisions contributing solid growth geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced long-haul shipments limited to West Group's pricing gain to 2%. Our cement business delivered strong first quarter operating performance and shipment growth despite the disruptions from February's historic high storm, I'm extremely grateful to our teams, their actions to proactively winterize and take our plants offline, allowed us to quickly return to normal production capacity post storm. To that effect, our cement operations established an all-time record from monthly shipments in March, demonstrating the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Mix adjusted pricing grew 2% during the quarter. Annual cement prices went into effect April 1 and have garnered widespread support in both North and South Texas. We expect our Cement business will continue to benefit from favorable market trends supported by continued market type as in Texas and diversified customer backlogs. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our ready-mix concrete operations established a first quarter record for shipments, which increased nearly 27% to 2 million cubic yards. Large nonresidential projects and incremental volume from operations acquired late last year contributed to double-digit shipment growth in Texas, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Concrete pricing declined 2%, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from a return to more typical winter weather conditions versus the prior year period, resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. As well pricing, however, improved 8%. Colorado market fundamentals remained strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular trends across our three primary end-use markets will drive sustainable construction led, aggregates intensive growth for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged by the recent initial gold steps to advance much needed infrastructure investment and a general consensus for success or legislation to the fixing America's surface transportation, or Fast Act in the coming months. With both congressional chambers working on their own reauthorization proposals, we're optimistic that a Fast Act replacement and increased funding levels will be passed before its expiration in September generating meaningful shipment benefits in 2022 and beyond. In the meantime, state and local infrastructure funding remains resilient. Estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top five state departments of transportations or DOT’s, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top five states, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to our business, representing 71% of total revenues for our 2020 building materials business. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 30% of first quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. The nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, broadly offsetting weakness in the more COVID-19 impacted like commercial and retail sectors. Light nonresidential activity should benefit from the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth in the longer term, in some regions, we're now seeing early signs of that recovery. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 37% of first quarter shipments. Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times where aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 27% of first quarter shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our first quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We achieved the highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2007. The Building Materials business established first quarter records for revenues and profitability. Products and services revenues increased 3% and to $857 million, while gross profit increased 25% to $148 million. We continue to drive sustainable and best-in-class aggregates unit profitability growth through the combination of price discipline and operational excellence. For the quarter, aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34% to $3.28 and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3% despite lower shipment volumes. In addition to pricing gains, lower contract services and internal freight costs contributed to these improvements. Our cement operations benefited from a 3% top line improvement. However, extended kiln downtime, reduced production levels and nearly $7 million of incremental energy and other costs all directly due to February's Texas deep freeze, led to a 1,160 basis point degradation in product gross margins. While these weather disruptions were headwinds to our first quarter results, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from growing demand and tight supply and remains on track to achieve its full year guidance. Ready mixed concrete product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3%, driven by double-digit shipment growth and lower delivery and raw material costs. Magnesia specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $65 million, a 9% increase. Higher shipment and production levels, combined with ongoing cost management, resulted in product gross margins of 43.5% and which matched the first quarter record established in the prior year. Now a look at our cash generation and capital allocation. The first quarter was a record for cash generation. Operating cash flows of $192 million increased 80%, driven by earnings growth and a reduction in working capital. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. All while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. We continue to prioritize high-returning capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Full year capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our first quarter earnings and cash generation were both records. As a result, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8 times as of March 31, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times. As Ward highlighted, our disciplined execution of SOAR 2025 is underway. Last week, we completed the Tiller acquisition. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and contribute $170 million of revenues and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the remaining 8 months of 2021. We financed the transaction using a combination of cash on our balance sheet and drawing an accounts receivable credit facility. Our full year 2021 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February and excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition. That said, we will revisit our 2021 guidance when we report our half year results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record first quarter results and industry-leading safety performance. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity both in the near and long term. As we SOAR to a sustainable future, we will continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful, an aggregates led growth platform, an unwavering commitment to disciplined pricing, operational excellence and safety and solid execution of our proven strategy. We're confident in Martin Marietta's outlook for the balance of 2021 and our ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value creation in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your question please.
Kathryn Thompson: Also, as you said in an earlier call today, this is TRG's 12 anniversary and Ward, if I recall, correctly, you guys would the very first moment marketing with and also the last before going into a global shutdown, but thank you over the years for your support.
Ward Nye: I thank you and congratulations on team that you built at TRG.
Kathryn Thompson: So the question today is around guidance. If you could just clarify and delineate the heritage guidance versus the additive that you outlined in today's release with Tillar help us understand why it wasn't raised and also leading into that, helping us better understand the current situation with cement in Texas given the shortages and how that also plays into your heritage guidance?
Ward Nye: Kathryn, again, congratulations to you and your team. I guess, a couple of things. One, the guidance that we've reaffirmed this morning is simply our heritage guidance. So again, we've given you revenue and EBITDA numbers for Tiller which you would need to go and add, obviously, to the heritage guidance to get what the effective guidance would be today. So that math is there. It's very easy to do. And the other thing that we've not done is changed guidance for the year here based on Q1. So remember, we're in an outdoor sport, and this has been January, February and March, and our view was changing it after those three months feels a bit premature to us. And again, I think we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year that was modestly ahead of where others have come out as well. So I think we have seen some degrees of guidance change today. But I think in many respects, it's been an effort to more balance where we were when we came out at the beginning of the year. So that's where we are relative to heritage guidance, please to add to that, what we've given you with respect to Tiller. As Jim said in his prepared remarks, we will come back at half year and revisit guidance. One of the things, obviously, I think we'll be revisiting will be what is happening with cement. As you know, Katherine, that's the second part of your question. We only have cement in Texas. And I'll draw several things to your attention. Number one, if we're looking at our backlogs in cement, the backlog in cement year-over-year are actually up pretty considerably. We're seeing cement tons up 24%. So number one, that's a nice takeaway.  Number two, the results that we turned in for the first quarter were despite the fact that, that business was effectively shut down for 11 days in February when Texas up with some unseasonably cold weather. We incurred about $7 million of expenses in semi business tied directly to energy and other pure production costs. We also had some inefficiencies that came from that. That ended up giving us effectively nearly a $14 million headwind, simply driven by that 11-day period. The other thing that I'll point out is, obviously, we do have a price increase that went into effect on April 1 that's at $8 a ton in that marketplace.  The other thing that we have done, recognizing that it's going to be tight in Texas this year on cement. We have put out a letter in the marketplace, and we've let our customers know that we're anticipating another $8 a ton price increase in September. So again, as we come back and give you some very specific answers to your question on cement and then ticking and tying that back to the guidance question. These are all a number of the variables that we will take into account as we revisit guidance at half year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: So Ward, during your recent Analyst Day, M&A was a major theme, and it's encouraging to see you announce an accretive acquisition this morning. So first off, can you talk about the deal rationale there? How growing your presence in the Minneapolis St. Paul market plays into your footprint strategically? And any color about the outlook and the health of that market there?
Ward Nye: I'll happy to. You led off with the right thing about is, look, we see this. It's accretive to cash and earnings in year 1. That's a nice place to start when we're thinking Tiller. If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that we have a leading position in 90% of our markets. Would that lead you to conclude that in 10% of the markets were not 1 or 2 this was 1 of the 10% of the markets. So again, we like the Minneapolis, St. Paul Marketplace. We wanted to be a leader in that marketplace. Through our SOAR process, we had identified Minneapolis, St. Paul as an MSA in which we wanted to grow. We had identified Tiller specifically as a target that we wanted to see if we could bring into Martin Marietta. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, if we look at Minneapolis, St. Paul, it's the 12th largest MSA in terms of aggregate consumption in the United States. So one of the things that got my attention was when I saw that they're actually more aggregates consumed in Minneapolis, St. Paul, than there are in Charlotte, which was not something that I think is intuitive to a lot of people. The other thing that's worth noting is Minnesota maintains the nation's fifth largest highway system, and they've got a budget of about $3.8 billion, and about 90% of that goes to highways purchasing roads. So we like the way that they invest in that place.  The other thing that I would say is this is a leading upstream business. It's aggregates led. It does have hot mix, but I want to be really clear here, Trey. It's not a laid out business. They're producing Blacktop that's basically being sold to contractors. So historically, Tiller has operated through a couple of subsidiaries, Barton Sanda Gravel, and that's literally their Sandy Gravel business and then a business called Commercial Asphalt. So those two businesses really comprise what they have. It's about 15-plus sites in the twin cities area. They've got a 30-year average pot life at their different locations. And again, they have an EBITDA there that learns very, very nicely with what we have in the central division. So back to SOAR, back to leading positions and in markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near-term and long term, that's what Tiller brings this organization. The other thing that I would say is, philosophically, the organizations are extraordinarily well aligned. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we closed on that Friday, and we were absolutely thrilled to bring several hundred people from Tiller into the Martin Marietta organization track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your question please.
Phil Ng : Congrats on a really strong quarter despite some challenging weather to start the year. I guess based on some back of envelope math, it looks like the full year aggregate guidance would imply some margin degradation, call it 30 basis points to 110 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Can you expand on that? I don't know if we're simply over extrapolating 1Q and you guys are not changing your full years because it's just too early. But any color in terms of margins the rest of the year for aggregates would be really helpful.
Ward Nye: Look, Phil, I would say it's really more the latter than the former. And that is -- don't be too linear just looking at what's out there. What I would say is we're not updating guidance right now simply because it's Q1. Obviously, we're very excited about what we saw in Q1. We're really excited about the fact that places like North Carolina VOT are back. The other thing that we're seeing in Q1 that I think we'll continue to see through the year as price fell through very, very nicely. You saw that. The other thing that I think we know we saw in Q1 was very good cost performance. I anticipate that we will continue to see good cost performance throughout the year. I think that's where you can have some degrees of give and take. The fact was diesel is likely to become an increasing headwind as we go through the year. Frankly, in Q1, it wasn't much of a headwind. It wasn't much of a tailwind either, but if we look at some of the cost buckets in which we saw a nice outperformance year-over-year, freight, moving material from a producing location to a yard was actually nicely better year-over-year.  Now if we see more sales going out of sales yards as the year goes on, obviously, that freight number would move. So with revenue, a number of things have moved with that. What I'll tell you as well as contract services were down. In other words, there were some stripping and other components that were down. Repairs were down, and we think those are likely the types of things that we will be able to hold on to. And I think that's evidence of good capital spend. Equally, we saw lower personnel costs. If you recall, last year, we did do some restructuring that was not necessarily COVID related, the timing of it just worked out very, very nicely. So what I would encourage you not to do is, again, take the guidance that we've not changed and then just assume everything continues in a linear fashion. Again, that's why we want to come back at half year and address it.  But again, I like the pricing dynamics that we're seeing in both aggregates and in cement. I think our teams have done an extraordinary job relative to costs. Again, if you're looking at gross profit per ton in the quarter, and you saw that going up at 34.5%. And if you're looking cash gross profit per ton to growth, I mean, we were almost 23% on that from what I can tell that looks like best-in-class types of metrics. So again, we're -- we feel very good about where we sit right now. And to be clear, we feel good about the balance of the year.
Phil Ng : Okay. Super helpful. It sounds like, all the good work you’ll doing on the cost front and the pricing is taking that’s really encouraging.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Stanley Elliott: You mentioned the strong Q1. Any commentary you'd want to share with us around how April trended relative to expectations? And then along those lines, kind of commentary for pricing overall?
Ward Nye: I'll address more pricing than I will, April last year, Stan, as you recall, we actually did talk a little bit about the quarters ahead, and we were being encouraged to do that by the SEC and others because it was such an extraordinary period of time. And as you know, our view typically is to live very tightly within the quarters. And we were doing that in large part because people were removing guidance last year. So I won't go into April, per se. I will say, clearly, there was nice momentum coming into Q1. Relative to pricing, but I would say is there are no surprises. On the aggregates piece of it, it's working exactly the way that we would have anticipated and the way that we planned. You saw the breakdown between reported and mix adjusted, as we talked about the quarter, again, reported up 3.4%, mix adjusted at 2.5%. Again, that's very much within the guide that we've given. I do think it's possible this year that you might see some aggregate tightness in certain markets on certain sizes. It's hard to tell at this moment, but I certainly think that, that's possible. If we see some of that, I think we could see some very discrete price changes maybe on a size basis later in the year. All of that's relative to aggregates.  If we're speaking of cement, it's obviously a different circumstance. So keep in mind, this is not a nationwide cement business. This is a Texas Cement business. Cement is tight in Texas. We feel very good about the $8 increase that we put into effect on April 1. We expect all of that, for example, the stick in the North Texas market. We think most of that is going to stick in the central market as well. And again, as I think I indicated before, our intention -- stated intention, published intention by letters to our customers is another $8 a ton price increase on September 1 and to give you a sense of it, that's going to be the first midyear that we believe that market is going to see since 2014. So I think that gives you a good sense of at least the degree of confidence that we have in pricing in that market standing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: I wanted to ask a little bit more about costs, if I could. Obviously, diesel is the most transparent, but you've seen huge increases in materials such as steel that I know you use a lot of we're hearing tightness in labor and transportation and other. So if you could address some of those challenges and any offsets that we could think about going forward, that would be great.
Ward Nye: No, Timna, I appreciate the question. If we go through our business, we're not seeing significant hits from inflation as we look at it again. So if we think about the buckets that will be cost for us, our single biggest bucket is going to be personnel. I mean the biggest thing that we're going to be able to flex there is what overtime hours look like in some markets because we largely have the teams in place that we need to put the material on the ground. The other thing that on some occasions, can be a bit of a challenge in some circumstances be freight, as we indicated in the first quarter, freight was actually down because we're seeing less moved by rail. I mean, if that goes up later in the year, what I would suggest to you is that's probably going to be a relatively high-class problem. So we're certainly not concerned about that. Again, we've got a good set of vendors. We have a good supply chain in place. Most of our supply chain is domestic. We think that very much cuts in our favor. So again, as we're looking at our overall cost profile, Timna so I'm very happy to report to you. We don't see anything on the cost profile that we feel like is going to be anything in a particular moment. I'll turn it to Jim to see if he has anything he'd like to add to that.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. No, the steel prices as a commodity market matter, obviously, are very elevated. We're not seeing it. We actually did a prebuy of mobile equipment from caterpillar earlier in the year. So we think we got ahead of any price increases that are coming our way. And to the extent that steel prices are inflating, plant, equipment, et cetera, we'll probably see that next year, but we're not seeing it yet this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.
Anthony Pettinari: You pointed to lower contract services in the quarter as a driver of improved gross margin. And I'm just wondering if you can provide any more detail on what drove that and how we should expect contract services maybe to come back or trend in 2Q or the remainder of the year?
Ward Nye: What I think the primary thing, overall contract services was, it was really cost aided by lower repairs, lower contract services by the rating in particular. So it's largely stripping costs, and we did not have as much stripping that we needed to do year-over-year. So it largely gets those two things, but it repairs, M&R and grading would be the two that I would highlight for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Jerry Revich: Ward, can you talk about the M&A pipeline from here? Obviously, you outlined a broad range of geographic targets at the Analyst Day. How are you -- how optimistic are you on potential additional capital deployment opportunities over the next couple of quarters? And if you could, can you just comment on if you're seeing people wanting to close quicker as a result of concerns about potentially higher capital gains taxes next year.
Ward Nye: I guess several things. One, look, Tiller, if we were talking about Tiller 10 years ago, we would actually beginning a lot of details on Tiller because it would have been material to this company 10 years ago. It's not material today. So Tiller, a very nice acquisition, but having done Tiller number one, it's important to state that, that doesn't do anything to draw down our firepower for the rest of the year. So let's start with that notion. So we've done one. It's completely consistent with SOAR, and we like it very much. Number two, the pipeline of deals that we're looking at is a pretty robust pipeline right now. And I will share with you some of them are larger than tiller. Some of them are smaller than to so it's impossible to know exactly how any of those will go. I think our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&A. That's what you will continue to see us do. I do think we were very clear in outlining areas in which we wanted to grow during Analyst and Investor Day and making sure that we went to those markets where we did not have a leading position and seeing if we could find a way to a leading position in those markets what's important. And again, that's completely consistent with what we did in Tiller.  With respect to timing, I'm not necessarily seeing people wanting to get things closed necessarily faster. I think most of them are more focused on either generational changes within a company or they're focused with a different strategy that they may be looking toward. Everybody is focused, as you would imagine, that's our week on value. And so the conversations around that are important. Equally are the synergies that we feel like we can pull out of transaction. So obviously, we're measuring those very carefully. And I think if we go back over time and look at the value that we've been able to deliver, whether it was on TXI or River for the Rockies or what we did with Bluegrass or otherwise. I think our track record there is good, and it's certainly our hope to be busy on the M&A front for the rest of the year. But what I would suggest to you in that respect is there's more to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from David McGregor of Longbow Research. Your question please. 
David McGregor: Congrats on the good quarter. You laid out your market mix earlier, just talking about infrastructure, nonres and res and the percentages that would correspond with each just wondering how that may vary from what you've got built into your guidance for 2021? And just if you could talk about how you see that mix migrating over the balance of the year that would be helpful.
Ward Nye: Yes. No. Look, I think several things are pretty clear. I think infrastructure is going to become increasingly better. And I would say that because if we're looking at our top five states, which again, are going to be over 70% of our revenue. When we think about what that looks like. I mean Texas FY 2021 letting levels of $1.5 billion from a tech top perspective is a 22% increase from where it was in 2020, and that's a very attractive number. Equally, if we look at NCDOT, their FY 2021 blending schedules are projected at $1.3 billion, and that's up from $670 million. So again, those are big movements. And even , which you know David, has long had a very attractive infrastructure budget is indicating higher learnings this year and they're emphasizing projects that they feel like are ready to go. So if we come back to a couple of states that are also important to us, Georgia and Colorado, those states, we're seeing is relatively flat year-over-year. But I think something that's worth keeping in mind is a lot of the COVID-19 economic relief that went to the dots are about to find their way into the system as well. So keep in mind, Colorado got $134 million in that process. And Georgia got $323 million in that process. So we think infrastructure is going to continue to get increasingly attractive. And depending on what happens in D.C., it could really become increasingly attractive next year. I think the thing that will continue to be moved by is how solid the non-res market is. And you can see it in the percentages that we talked about in today's release, the market for industrial, logistics and data center facilities continues to flourish. And clearly, that's benefiting from the critical role that these facilities play in supporting business operations, and we think we're incredibly well positioned to serve markets like Atlanta, DFW, Austin, San Antonio, Des Moines, Omaha, Indianapolis and others. What's important there, though, David, is we're seeing what we thought we would see, but we're seeing it modestly earlier. And that is, if you recall, when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, our view was we thought we would start to see some green shoots in light non-res and have to. I think the words we used where we thought we would start to see that inflect then we still do. But what's encouraging is we're seeing some of that in some markets even earlier than we would have thought. So for example, if we're looking in Atlanta today, clearly, Atlanta is seeing a significant uptick in corporate relocations and expansions, which plays well into the light piece of it. Equally, Colorado is seeing good light commercial in office and retail, and that's starting to pick up now. And that's an area that we knew would come because it's going to follow housing with a lag, we just thought the lag might be a little bit longer. And then importantly, as we're looking at residential today, we think Martin Marietta with the Southeast, Southwestern footprint. Is particularly well positioned to benefit from what's happening with housing. So again, if we put housing in context, the 30-year average for single-family starts is $1 million. So if we consider that a 3 is a key threshold for what we think is normalized aggregates focused demand, where we think we're going to be for the next several years. And that dimension is pretty exciting because we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day that there's a correlation between single-family starts and aggregates intensity with a 1 year lag, that's at about 99%. And if you look at the March 2021 seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing in the United States for single family starts, it was at $1.2 million. And again, the last time we saw numbers like that, were back in 2007 and back in 2001. And by the way, we like the way the market was looking at both of those times. So I think infrastructure is clearly getting better we think non-res and the heavy sign is attractive right now, but we think light is getting better. And we think housing, but in particular, single-family housing in Martin Marietta markets is really being held back only by availability today. And again, when we're trying to rank problems, David, that's probably a high-class problem.
Operator: Next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Garik Shmois: Given some of the midyear price increase opportunities you cited, particularly in aggregates and given the inflationary environment that you're in, or just curious how we should think about the cadence of pricing that, yes, the rest of the year and I know we're not into 2022 yet, but should we anticipate a breakout in price growth potentially next year?
Ward Nye: Yes, Garik, just to be clear, when I was speaking to the aggregates piece of it, I think what I said was I thought we might see some discrete wins on a size by size basis, specific tight in some markets. And clearly, the cement commentary that I offered was different than that because we are already seeing tightness in a very large market in Texas. But back to your commentary, what we've long said is pricing on a percentage tends to follow volume to a degree on a percentage with a bit of a lag.  So Garik, if you're looking at the marketplace, and you're saying, look, I know you've got a markup going on in-house T&I on an infrastructure bill. You've got a markup going on in Senate EPW on an infrastructure bill. It looks like something is going to happen. It looks like something is going to happen this year. It looks like whatever that something is, is likely to be the biggest something that we've seen in 15 years. I think that bodes well. If we go back to the commentary that I was just offering to David, in his question relative to non-res and res, we think that's probably pretty healthy too.  So I think coming back to the proposition that you're offering, if the volume is going to be there, I do think it gives the opportunity for there to be pricing ahead of what we've seen over the last several years because keep in mind, that's been very much in a volume muted environment. So the pricing that we just offered you through the course of this conversation is with aggregate volume is actually down 3% in the quarter. And by the way, we anticipated that. So I think the proposition that you've offered is right. I think there's still more to watch and more to come, but I have a hard time thinking that what you posed isn't, where we would think about it, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, can you comment on the multiple you paid for Tiller or give us any kind of a sense for your net debt after closing the deal?
Ward Nye: What I'll do more of the latter than the former. And because, as I said, if Tiller had been 10 years ago, it would have been material, and we would talk about it. Obviously, this is a transaction we've done with the family, and we have nondisclosure obligations that we want to remain confident. I mean, secure around -- I will turn it over to Jim because what you'll hear is despite the fact that we've done what would have been a very notable transaction a decade ago. We're still in a very attractive spot. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Yes, this really doesn't meaningfully change our debt-to-EBITDA leverage, Adam. We're still just south of our 2 times to 2.5 times target zone. So this really will not be much of an impact for our M&A pipeline and executing on that going forward. Our liquidity is great. Cash flow is good and improving. And as we mentioned, this deal is accretive to earnings and cash flow in year 1.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Wilson of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Josh Wilson: I wanted to come at the ag markets just 1 more time, and I appreciate 1Q is an unusual quarter. But if you could just quantify for us some of the good guys and bad guys there since you were up 500 basis points from basically flat dollars, just so we can get a sense of the size of which ones are sustainable and which aren't. And maybe if you could quantify diesel fuel going forward as well. So we can have a flavor for that, that would be helpful.
Ward Nye: Yes. Let me do this. Let me ask Jim to come back and address some of the very specific puts and takes on that, and I'll give you some broad commentary afterwards.
Jim Nickolas: Okay. Yes. So Josh, the most sustainable the good guys, as you call it, for the quarter, was price. That's something that's our own front. That's $19 million of benefit this quarter. One of the bad guys was volume down 3%. That was about $5 million of profit impact. The rest are good guys. So internal freight expense improved by $6 million. Again, that depends on end markets, it depends where that makes stay works at. It may grow again if we have higher sales to yards, contract services improved by $5 million, repairs expense improved by $3.5 million personal expense improved by $2 million. Diesel expense improved by just under $1 million, so basically neutral, but almost across the board improved lower expenses for the quarter.
Ward Nye: So Josh, if we think about -- with the background of that, what we're likely to see going forward, I would say several things. If you're looking for things that will be a headwind. I think the biggest single headwind the industry will likely face will be diesel fuel. So remember last year, energy was quite low. But if we think about what we're seeing, we think pricing is going to continue to be very attractive for us. We think geographic mix is likely to be attractive for us this year because keep in mind, we had a record year last year with North Carolina really sitting on the bench. And North Carolina is not sitting on the bench at all anymore. We equally believe that our aggregates business in Texas and our cement business in Texas is going to perform very, very well this year. We think Colorado is going to have a very attractive year. The only thing that's wrong in Colorado in '21 is that Colorado had a superb '20. So keep in mind, they had a very wet '19 that deferred work from '19 into '20. And then they literally had the perfect storm in '20 with beautiful weather and a late winter setting in so I think Jim is giving you a good sense, of course, some of the good guys and bad guys are. I think there are a lot more good guys than bad guys. So I think one more good guy, I want to make sure we call out because they really don't get the credit that they deserve is what we think is happening with respect to Magnesia Specialties as well. And again, this is a real differentiator for Martin Marietta, Q1 revenues of $65 million represents almost a 9% increase over the prior year. And that's led by what Jim was referring to earlier, so it's a nice year research and steel industry. So if we're looking at domestic steel, that's rebounded now to 78% capacity keep in mind, when we were about half year last year, that was a 51% utilization. So again, we're seeing even in that line of our business, a very nice recovery and we're seeing record Q1 gross profit in that business. But importantly, we're seeing record margin percentages in that business that correspond with what it was seeing a year ago in Q1. So we feel like both on the Magnesia Specialties business and the materials business, we're at a very attractive place where there's going to be more of this goodness that goes forward, then we're going to get back.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Michael Dudas: The -- thinking about the release -- the COVID release money that's starting to get out and probably be more factored in later this year. Are you anticipating -- because there's some discretion from state governments on that? Or are you anticipating a portion or a good portion or a little portion of that falling into the '22 fiscal year budgets? And then when you think about layering in, let's open eventual fast back renewal and big successful infrastructure bill somehow. Is that going to also influence like how you think about what the opportunity is going to be for '22, '23 and beyond, because that seems to be a lot of capital flowing into the markets that could be coming pretty tight at then?
Ward Nye: No. Look, we agree. And the short answer is, look, if we look that $10 billion of the COVID economic release that's already out there. We talked about some of the dollars that had gone specifically to places like Georgia, $323 million and in Colorado. And I mean, to put some more context to it, if we look at Texas, that was not $114 million, North Carolina $260 million, in Florida $473 million even in a state like Indiana, $238 million. So these are dollars that can move needles. Answer to number one, do we see that a decent piece of it going late '21 or into '22, I think the answer is yes, we do. Do we think we're going to see a new highway build at notably higher numbers, either through the reauthorization process or other processes, we believe that we will. We think that will likely impact '22, but we think that's probably likely to be even more impactful by the time we get to '23. Now with respect to the ability to meet what that need is going to be, I would say, several things: One, contractors have been hiring because they had the ability to hire during periods of time when labor was tighter in other places. So we believe contractors are going to be in a position to meet this amped up need in an appropriate and responsible ways. Importantly, from a material supply perspective, what I can tell you is we have a business that would have the ability should we need to put about 250 million tons of material on the ground. And if you look at what we produced and sold last year, I'd say it was 180-some materials -- tons of materials. So our ability to ramp up, if we needed to, is there. It's present. And what's important to state, and I think this goes back to the essence of your question, Mike, we would not have to put notable capital in to do it. We might have to run some longer hours to do it. But we could certainly do that without having to go deep to the well on CapEx. So I hope that helps.
Michael Dudas: Yes. That's what I was leading to. Certainly, the operating leverage is quite there. Do you have a gut feel whether it's going to be reconciliation or fast back renewal or brand-new bipartisan opportunity?
Ward Nye: That's a great question. And the only thing I can tell us we can all that and we'll probably all be wrong in some respect. I think this is one that they're likely to find a bipartisan way to do. And I think if they do it's going to be a lot more highways, bridges and roads focused than some of the administration proposals that are out there. I think if they can find a way to make it more infrastructure in the way you and I would define infrastructure. There's a way towards a bipartisan agreement. I think if it can't be more focused on that, then I think reconciliation and other methodology comes into play in a more significant way. But again, as I'm looking at markups that are underway in both EPW and the Senate and T&I in the house right now, there's a reason that they're marking that up, and there's the reason that I think they want to have Mark Ups out by Memorial Day. And I think there'll be more to come, but I think we'll find bipartisan agreement on this if I'm betting that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Ward Nye: Paul, are you there?
Operator: Mr. Roger, please make sure your line isn't muted, and if you are not, speak the phone with your handset.
Paul Roger: Yes. That was a scoop again. Apologies for that, guys. Apologies Congratulations on the start.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Paul. Good to hear your voice.
Paul Roger: Yes, likewise. So conscious will obviously come into the end of the call. Now I'll maybe take a slightly different track and ask about the green agenda. I mean, clearly, the environmental agendas going up in the U.S. Can you speak a bit broadly about risks and opportunities that creates for you? And then maybe specifically, are you at all concerned that we could see an increase in the use of recycled aggregate at the expense of some higher margin product?
Ward Nye: Look, you're right, ESG is clearly taking up a new form of debate, both in the United States and as you're well aware, internationally. I would say several things. I do think there are opportunities for Martin Marietta as we go through that. Number one, I think resilient construction is going to be an important part of any dialogue relative to ESG. And I think we can demonstrate that the types of constructions in which we will participate tend to meet that criteria, number one. Number two, if we're looking at wind farms and wind generation of power, one of the things that we called out specifically last year, we were seeing -- I think it was in Q4 tonnage was down over 1 million tons just in our Midwest Division because we had seen that division not having as much tonnage go out to wind energy projects because some tax credits that historically had been in place had expired. So we're seeing more tax credits going toward wind energy, and we believe that we will. We think the opportunities are there for that. I think another area of focus is likely to be relative to water and into infrastructure that's underground. And I think people are particularly sensitive to degrees of water that communities are simply losing on a year in, year out basis, we think our products are going to be vitally important in that as well. Now with respect to green and recycle and how that's going to work in different markets and the degree to which recycle concrete or otherwise could become more ubiquitous. I would offer several things. One, specifications are still going to be drawn up by, obviously, our friends at ASTM, the federal government in different state DOT’s.  Keep in mind, cross stone is an essential element in the manufacturer of ready mix concrete. It's essential in hub mix asphalt. At least in the recycled asphalt paving that we see. The primary component of recycle that's valuable to contractors and that, it's not so much the stone but rather the bitumen or the liquid asphalt that's in that. So we think we'll continue to see that. But even most state DOT’s that are aggressive with what can be used on wrap or recycled asphalt saving, it's 25% or 30%. And so we don't think that's going to be a significant replacement for aggregates. And equally, while you can have certain degrees of crushed concrete that can serve as a commercial base. In most instances, it will still not meet a clean stone specification for use in heavy highway airport or other work. The other thing to remember, Paul, and this is so important. And that is despite the fact that our company has seen a nice increase and a steady increase in pricing over time. We're still selling aggregates on average for, let's call it, $14, $15 a ton. It's very difficult to have even a green product that can substitute for aggregates, that's going to be a cost-effective product in that respect because even when people are utilizing recycled concrete, oftentimes, there's rebar in that concrete, which means the crushing process tends to be quite complicated. So you asked me what time it was. I probably told you how to build a clock, but it's a great question, and it's complicated. It's something we've given a lot of thought to, but we have a lot of resilience around the view that this is an industry that is here for a long time.
Paul Roger: That's great. I mean, I think there's a perception that sometimes U.S. companies like. So it's nice you've got a good story itself.
Ward Nye: Well, Paul, thank you so much for that. The other thing that I would remind you, we put out our sustainability report literally last week that gives a good overview of exactly how Martin Marietta is approaching ESG issues. So thank you so much for your comment on that.
Ward Nye: As I understand it, that's the end of our questions today. So what I'll do at this point is thank you all for joining today's earnings call. In short, we believe our company is superbly positioned to create substantial long-term shareholder value. Supported by our differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review, Martin Marietta is poised to drive substantial growth in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2021 results in just a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care. Goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-09 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Martin Marietta's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for the replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.  In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our full year operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our 2020 financial results and liquidity position. After which, Ward will discuss market trends and our 2021 outlook. A question-and-answer session will follow.  I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta, we're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption.  Martin Marietta set new performance records, delivering almost profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history. These impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven Strategic Operating Analysis and Review or SOAR plan.  As noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook. Before doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record setting fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19. These top-line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues, 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share.  For the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement.  Martin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for our longstanding financial success. Martin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world class safety levels. We achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020. And for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a company-wide world class lost time incident rate. These superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders’ needs.  With that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance. Aggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions. However, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity. Aggregates’ average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line’s resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies.  The disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward. Our cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly 4 million tons. Large project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector. Pricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the State of Texas. We expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020. Concrete pricing increased 2%. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to 3 million tons. This growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019. Asphalt pricing increased nearly 3%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results and liquidity. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Driving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase. Our Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit. Aggregates’ product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%. These accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. The Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019. The timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020. More importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations. We achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants. These factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs, contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in Cement product gross margin to 37.8%. Our targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth. Our Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter. The 12% top-line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year. As a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million. We anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity. Impressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures. Turning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity. Martin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain: focus on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile. For 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock. In August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. We ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities. Our solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength for Martin Marietta to respond and to execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2021 outlook.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets and key geographies. We expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates-intensive growth. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient. With the 1-year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Importantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues. Additionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls. This funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements. Based on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top 5 states. Over the medium to long-term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multi-year growth in product demand. In November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in one-time and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state. Bipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills. We believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act. We're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond. We expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta. Importantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects. Light commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. Over the longer term, light non-residential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments. Single-family housing is poised for multi-year growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle. We believe Martin Marietta's leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments. In summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business. As disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance. We currently expect 2021 aggregate shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels. We remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs. For 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January 1 to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%. Combined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1,350 million to $1,450 million. Keep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of non-recurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020. To conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We're also extremely optimistic about our future. Martin Marietta has a strong foundation, thanks to our solid balance sheet and the investments we've made in our assets, people and capabilities. Due to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. Importantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success. As we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth. We're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. I show our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. 
Kathryn Thompson: Nice results today, given a tough market. Wanted to focus on Cement. If you could discuss the pricing dynamics you saw in the quarter, and importantly, your thoughts on both volume and pricing going forward? And then just really kind of a follow-up related to cement somewhat, which is more on infrastructure. Do you see any potential air pockets in lettings, given reduced revenues? And when might that be seen, if ever? And how might that impact cement volumes and also aggregate volumes?
Howard Nye: Well, Happy New Year to you, Kathryn, that's a mouthful. We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember how we spoke about cement when we acquired it with TXI, we indicated we believe Texas cement pricing would start to act like aggregate pricing. That's exactly what we saw in this quarter. What I think is doubly important about that and impressive, keep in mind, for much of the year, we were not in a position to go and see our customers. So to see that type of performance on a mix adjusted basis is actually quite impressive. Keep in mind too, although you don't see it in the numbers, if we're looking at type 1 and type 2 cement, that was actually selling for closer to 4% up as opposed to 3% up. So if we're really looking at the bread-and-butter products, it looks really quite impressive.  If we look at overall cement dynamics in the State, Texas is a nice place to be in any heavy side building materials business. Because particularly for cement right now, demand outstrips supply, and that's always a good place to start. We think that's particularly going to be the case as we go through the year in North Texas this year. So again, that feeds directly into our operations in Midlothian. Equally, the marketplace that we're seeing around Hunter is actually quite attractive as well.  What we see from a volume perspective has been driven by a series of things. One, by some big jobs. So in the North, we're seeing Loop 12. We're seeing I-635, which is also known as the LBJ. If you go down toward South Texas, what's going on relative to the Grand Parkway has been nicely generative or utilizing cement and ready-mix and aggregates and all the way through. So we think the outlook is frankly as good as we just saw in Q4. If you're looking really more to what potential air pockets could be, I'll tell you very candidly, in Texas, we don't see it, Kathryn. A couple of things lead me to believe that. One, the FY '21 lettings in Texas are actually 25% over where they were last year. In other words, we're looking for about $9.5 billion worth of lettings. The other 2 pieces to keep in mind is the 2021 revenue streams that we're seeing either coming through Prop 7 and Prop 1 in Texas are really quite healthy. So we're looking at transfers of about $2.5 billion this year relative to Prop 7 and about $1.2 billion relative to Prop 1.  Something else that's worth keeping in mind, too, is when we were looking at the COVID relief that's called into different DOTs, Texas was the recipient of almost $914 million. Again, we spoke to the fact that those have not come encumbered with any particular state match. So for a state that already found itself in a very good position to have that extra money come in as well gives us a sense that we're in a very, very good place.  As an ultimate reminder, Texas has rained a fund of $10.5 billion that they have not tapped. So as we're looking at Texas, both near term, medium-term and long-term, we like very much what we see. So I hope that's responsive to your series of questions, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: Congratulations, Ward, on a really good quarter. And a good outlook statement as well. It's nice to see guidance again. Just staying on Cement. I guess how are you thinking about the guide that you provided $460 million to $500 million, what have you got for price versus volume in there? If you could help me with that? And also, it appear that maybe there's limited operating leverage in that guidance as well. I'm just wondering if that's maybe some of the kiln expenses from 2020 that got pulled into 2019 if those come back and maybe that's why you leave it on the leverage. And just if I could also add to that, you must be feeling some pinch points in terms of capacity in cement at this point. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking longer term about your capacity footprint. Do you flex your shipments with import tons? Or do you invest capital either organically or through acquisitions in building your capacity? Or maybe you're just happy with what you've got. If you could talk about that?
Howard Nye: No, happy to, David. Thank you very much for your questions. We'll start with respect to pricing. So as we think about pricing in the Texas marketplace today, what we're seeing are price increases out there that have been put out. We put out a $9 a ton price increase effective in April. We've seen others that customers have shown us that have been closer to $6. So I think that gives you at least some base to think about relative to pricing for the year. I think equally, as we look at the likelihood of price increases hitting in different percentages, clearly, North Texas is going to look stronger than South Texas is. Central is going to be just fine. I think to your point, if it's going to be tight anywhere this year on cement tonnage, it's likely more in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, meaning Midlothian. And so we'll just have to watch that as the year goes on.  One thing I would ask you to do is, and that is you asked a very good question around capacity in Texas, because you're going back to the notion that right now demand is outstripping supply. As you know, we have an Analyst and Investor Day that's coming up later this month. We're going to talk about some of the very specific capital initiatives that we have underway. And I would ask you to wait and listen to what we have to say about that particular process when we're talking to you live later in the month relative to our cement outlook and our aggregates outlook in Texas. With respect to some of the other numbers that you mentioned, you're entirely right relative to rhythm and cadence around kiln maintenance. We did have a relatively lower number of kiln maintenance in 2020. If we're looking at the overall kiln maintenance spend in 2020, it was about $19.7 million. As we're looking to see what it's going to be into the new year, we are looking at a number that's going to be somewhat higher than that. We're looking more at about a $22.7 million number for total kiln maintenance in '21. And so we're looking at some of those puts and takes. But I think that gives you a sense of do we have capacity issues that we need to think about longer and medium term? Yes, we do. Are we in a circumstance that pricing is doing what we thought it would? It absolutely is. Are the dollars that we've put into the kilns having them run at a higher rate of efficiency? There's no doubt that they are.  So if we're looking at kiln reliability, as Jim commented in his commentary, they ran at 90% kiln reliability in the year just ended. The year before, it's at 82%. So we like very much the way that business is going operationally, the way that business is going commercially and what we feel like its future is. So David, I hope that was responsive to your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens, Inc. 
Trey Grooms : So I guess, first off -- and I'm looking at the volume guidance for aggregates, and I appreciate your color and comments on the end markets. But especially on the infrastructure piece, you sound maybe more constructive on that side than we've heard in a while. First, I mean, I want to make sure I'm hearing that right because I'm hearing that you're expecting increased demand versus '20. And with that mix becoming closer to the historic average, even directionally that way implies decent volume growth in that end market. I know you mentioned some details around Texas, but could you touch on some of the other markets you're in, where you're seeing the strength that's given you that increased confidence in that end market?
Howard Nye: No, happy to, Trey. Thank you very much. As you indicated, we've walked through what some of the numbers look like in Texas. As Jim indicated in his prepared remarks, if we look at Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, those states comprise around 71% of our revenue. So those states are going well, a lot of things good happens for Martin Marietta. As I indicated, I won't go back through all the details that we hit, but we're looking at Texas lettings up 25%. Let's go through the others and I think that will give you a sense of why we've got the degree of confidence that we do. Colorado, which, as you know, in '20 had just a spectacular year. I mean, you heard us reference the fact that our asphalt and paving business in that State had a record year. We're looking at a DOT program in Colorado that we believe is going to be flat year-over-year. And what I'm about to tell you is when we're looking at our top 5 states, yet the worst that we're seeing anywhere is flat, that's not a bad place to be coming off of a record year. So if we're looking at the $10 billion COVID stimulus, about $134 million of those dollars is finding its way to Colorado, which we believe is to bring their DOT program up about even with where it was last year. Now by contrast, our home State, North Carolina, did not have a particularly good year last year. We think North Carolina DOT is in a far better position. And as you know, if we look at this State, historically, it has not only been one of our most profitable. It's been one of our most consistent as well. So we think North Carolina is trending back into an area that makes much more sense for us. To give you a sense of what that means, the FY '21 lettings projection is about $1.3 billion. That's $670 million better than I think people would have expected when they were looking at it last year. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is North Carolina did issue $700 million of build in C bonds. So again, as we're looking at the near-term future of North Carolina, we're really very pleased with that. One thing I will mention as well, the NC First Commission, which I was a part of here in North Carolina, looked at really how North Carolina needs to think about its investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And our view was they needed to put at least $20 billion more in infrastructure in the State. So the State is looking at ways to do that. But that's clearly longer term than just this year. If we go to Georgia, again, we think Georgia is relatively flat year-over-year. But if you look at where that State has been sequentially, if we go back to 2016, you'll see a budget that's gone from about $1.7 billion to one that's about $2.1 billion. And then the other thing to keep in mind is Georgia still has ahead of it the major mobility investment program. And the overall goal of that is to have a number of very large projects, about $12 billion to be more specific, underway by 2025 and completed by 2030. And then, of course, the last, the top 5 states is Florida, they're looking at their spending to increase about 20% year-over-year. So again, if we look at the top 5, Texas is better, North Carolina is better. Florida is better and Colorado and Georgia are broadly flat. So when we look at that type of trajectory on something that's around 71% of our revenues in those states, I think that's part of what gives us the confidence that, that we have and the volume outlook that we've offered today.
Trey Grooms : All right. Ward, if I could sneak one in just for clarity. There was a question about the cement and the maintenance, and you talked about some color around that and some details, which was helpful. On the ag side, Jim, this might be for you. Is there anything there -- obviously, diesel is not going to be the tailwind you experienced in '20. But is there any other cost outside of diesel coming off the year like 2020 when, I mean, from a margin and cost standpoint, you and the team did a great job there. Is there any catch-up on costs that are baked into your guide? Or anything we should be aware of on that front?
Jim Nickolas: Good question, Trey. Now we are anticipating, otherwise, hitting a 60% incremental target for next year, but for the diesel headwind. So our incremental is around 40% because of diesel. We've got about $30 million of higher expense from higher oil prices coming through. And we would add 60% but for that. So -- but otherwise, our costs are well behaved. Quite -- we're expecting them to be sort of well controlled as they were in 2020. We expect that to continue. Hold on to the gains we saw in 2020 and build on those 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.
Anthony Pettinari : Ward, on the full year outlook, is there any way we should think about the quarterly cadence of volume growth implied in the guidance? Do you still expect kind of sharper year-over-year volume declines in the first half and then kind of inflecting into the second half? Or any kind of finer point you can put on that?
Howard Nye: As we look at it, and I think part of what you heard us say earlier, I mean, we're back to the point that we put in full guidance again. So I think that gives you a sense that we've all found a way to manage through this. And I think to that end, Anthony, what I would suggest is a normal rhythm and cadence is probably broadly the right way to think about this. I do think there's going to be a degree to which you'll see some of it that's going to be modestly more in the back half as opposed to the front half. Obviously, Q2 and particularly Q3 were the 2 quarters that were most impacted by COVID. By the time we got to Q4, in many respects, we had a lot of this figured out. And certainly, we had more favorable weather in Q4. So I would look broadly at a rather normal rhythm and cadence, slightly heavier toward half 2 as opposed to half 1. I hope that's helpful.
Anthony Pettinari : That's very helpful. And then, I mean, to your point, I mean, the volumes have held up better-than-expected over the last 12 months. In terms of what could get you to the high end or the low end of that 1% to 4% aggregates volume guide, is private commercial, is that the biggest question mark for you? Or do you think residential could slow down in the second half? Or are there any particular states? Just wondering if there's maybe a few swing factors for you when you think about 2021 that could get you to the high end or the low end?
Howard Nye: That's a great question. Here's how I would catch in that. I think we've got a good sense of what public is going to look like, and we think public is going to look better. And I think we have a good sense of what residential is going to look like, and residential is going to look better. And residential is particularly going to look better with respect to single-family. We believe single-family as a percentage of overall housing will return to more normalized percentages. In other words, it's going to be about 80% of housing in the United States. And when we see single-family housing at 1 million starts or 1.1 million or 1.2 million, I will tell you, that's a pretty healthy place for our business. Because here's what happens. That's evidence of new neighborhoods being built. And so if you think about 2 cities that are important to us, think about Atlanta and think about Dallas, both tend to be North-South cities, both tend to be growing more North than South. So what that means is, years ago, you were growing North from Dallas to Plano, now you're growing from Dallas to Frisco and now you're going to be moving North from Frisco to North of Frisco.  As we see new communities come-in in Frisco or as they go into Alpharetta or other places North of Atlanta, new communities need the follow-on effect that you get in non-residential. Now history tells us, depending on geography, that can have a 6 to, let's call it, an 18-month lag behind it. If we're seeing single-family growth in communities and you've got a 6-month lag on that, that can start pushing you toward the higher end of our volume guidance. Because if we think about the different end uses, res infrastructure is going to be better. Residential is going to be better, particularly single-family.  As we land on non-res, as we said comparatively the toughest of the 3 end uses, the heavy side of that, we believe, is going to be good. With warehousing, data, et cetera, all of which are very aggregates-intensive. So some of the swing side to the upper end of that is going to be relative to the drag along effect of the light portion of non-res that we believe will follow continued single-family growth. So that was a mouthful. And I apologize if that was a mouthful, but I hope that was followable.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich : Ward, I'm wondering if you could talk about how active your M&A pipeline is at this point? And how much is uncertainty around what tax rates could look like? How is that playing into your appetite for M&A and the overall impact on the M&A market as you see it? 
Howard Nye: Jerry, thanks for the question. What I would say is, if you look at what M&A has done for Martin Marietta through the SOAR years, and by that, I mean, from 2010 today, M&A has been our preferred methodology of growth. It has served us and our owners well. We think it will continue to serve us well. When we think about M&A, we think about it in a long-term strategic view. At the same time, we're not going to go into transactions that we know are not going to be near term attractive deals for us either. In fairness, typically, we're not going to take tax rates much into account in the way that we're looking at M&A. Because we feel like getting the right deal in the right market is the most important thing that we can do for our company near term and long-term. It allows our teams to grow. It allows our company to grow. It lets us grow into markets that we think will be attractive. And at the end of the day, where we believe we can have leading positions.  As you'll recall, we have a leading position in 90% of our markets today. 10 years ago, we had a leading position in 65% of our markets. We're going to be looking at M&A through 2 different lenses. We're going to be looking at it in bolt-on acquisitions in markets that we currently exist. But equally, we will look at potential platform acquisitions in markets in which we would like to grow. As a reminder and we've not been shy about this, we've long talked about the 2050 regional planning that shows what growth is going to look like in the United States between now and 2050. And the short answer is the country is going to add about 140 million people over that time period, and 70% of them will land in one of 11 mega regions. And so if you watch the mega regions and see what -- where they are and if you look at our footprint, the likelihood is we will continue to want to be focused in those mega regions, either with bolt-ons or with platforms.  Relative to our M&A pipeline and our team, they would like to sleep more. But the short answer is they're very busy people right now. They are very talented people. And we're very grateful for them. And our intention is to do all that we can to keep them tired and hungry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from UBS. 
Nishu Sood : So I wanted to ask about -- this has obviously been unusually volatile time for the industry, coming off a quarter in which volumes were quite affected by the pandemic. Do you think there was any effect in 4Q of maybe some deferrals, projects that might have been affected by the pandemic being completed in 4Q? And obviously, with the milder weather, it would have been conducive to that. Do you think that had any effect on 4Q?
Howard Nye: Nishu, number one, welcome back. It's good to hear your voice. Number two, with respect to your question, I'm sure that we would be naive not to assume that there was some that would have been pushed into Q4, simply because Q3 would have been more impacted and the weather was favorable. So I think that's certainly a possibility. What I think we saw more of though is the build of some momentum and saw nice momentum going into four. Experience tells me that contractors are finishing a year in which they don't have good confidence in the next year. Rather than hurry up, they tend to slow down because they want to make sure that they have plenty of work for their workforces as they come into a new year. So what I would say too is, I mean I think that's certainly possible, Nishu, but I equally think what we're seeing, particularly relative to single-family housing and what's tending to follow it and then the overall health of the DOTs in the states in which we are operating, I think those are coalescing to give nice momentum in 4 that we believe persists into '21.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. 
Philip Ng : Ward, can you provide a little more color on bidding activity and how your backlogs are shaping up broadly. But certainly, any color, particularly on non-res and maybe some of these energy projects that you have talked about in the past that may have gotten pushed out, are you seeing some of that come back as well?
Howard Nye: Phil, thanks so much for your question. What I would say is the customer backlogs are looking fairly similar in many respects to where they were last year. One thing that's worth remembering is the backlogs really, at this time of the year for customers, only represent about 20% to 35% of what people really think their shipment needs are going to be. But what I would say is overall aggregate tons are modestly up as we talk to our customers right now. If we look at cement tons, they're actually up double-digits right now. If we look at Magnesia Specialties, they're actually up double-digits as well. So I think part of what's important to remember, Phil, is we're going into '21, two parts of our business that have historically been very good, steady parts of our business, meaning North Carolina and Magnesia Specialties did not have the best years in '20 and are both looking at considerably better years coming into the year in '21.  So as we're looking at overall backlogs, they look really quite good for us. The only area that our backlogs are notably off would be in portions of Colorado. And what we're seeing in Colorado, and I think this goes back to your question, is actually right now a very good level of bidding activity in that State. So as we mentioned, we're coming off what was a record year last year in Colorado. And we anticipate it coming into '21, that would almost have to be modestly slower. As I indicated in some of the earlier questions, with some of the COVID money that is coming to Colorado, DOT numbers are broadly even, and now we're seeing much better bidding activity. So I guess what I have to say on that, Phil, is more to come. But I try to give you what we feel like is a good march across the enterprise to give you a sense of where we think customer backlogs are.
Philip Ng : Any color on the new projects you've talked about that got pushed out maybe?
Howard Nye: Yes, the large energy projects, it's going to be interesting to see because, obviously, we're seeing energy pricing come back in ways this year that we anticipated that they would. I think part of what we had anticipated is until we started seeing that we were likely to see a slowdown on those jobs. We think we're likely to see those take off more in 2022. We had picked up very recently some volume on one of those projects in South Texas. So again, I think there are no big surprises, and there's nothing markedly different there than we spoke of as we really ramped up the year last year. Although it does look near term modestly brighter on some of the commitments that have been made over the last few weeks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.
Courtney Yakavonis : Maybe if you could just comment on -- within the quarter -- I think you gave for the full year, what, your infrastructure and resi was up. Infrastructure, I guess, you mentioned North Carolina being down, but can you just comment what it was in the fourth quarter by end market? And then in light of the comments that you would expect more typical seasonality for the first half versus second half next year. Can you just help us think about if there's going to be any difference between how you would envision those end markets returning to growth next year, if it shall be starting in the first quarter? Or some of those will be more back half loaded?
Howard Nye: Courtney, number one, welcome. We're delighted to have you here in this group and nice to have your question, too. If I think about end uses, here's the way I would think about it. I'd rather just talk about from a full-year perspective, Courtney, because I think that's probably a more directionally appropriate way to look at, at least from my seat in the bus. Infrastructure ended up last year to about 36% for us. Non-res was tight for infrastructure at 36%, and residential was at 24%. So that gives you a pretty good snapshot of what volumes look like for the year. What I would tell you is, I think 36% for infrastructure is awfully low. That said, an end-use that ought to be in the low to mid-40s. I certainly believe with what we're starting to see from our leading states right now -- and again, we've not built in a long-term highway bill into anything that we're talking about relative to '21. But if our states continue investing the way that they are and we see a long-term bill come through from the federal government, we think that 36% moves up toward the 40% number and maybe even ahead of that, that would feel more logical to us.  If we look at non-res at 36%, that's an odd one to me, and I'll tell you why. Historically, if we look at non-res, it would have been very consistent at about 30% of our volume. And that would have historically been a pretty clear defining break with non-res light being about half of that and non-res heavy being about half of that overall 30%. Year just ended, it was 36%. But here's what's happened. Clearly, the light portion of non-res has gone up. The heavy portion of non-res has gone up. But the irony is that heavy portion of non-res is really heavy right now. So what we're seeing is in data warehousing and the other delivery products that we're having, the sheer aggregates intensity of heavy non-res is richer than we've ever seen before. That is actually serving to fill, in large measure, the tonnage hole that would otherwise be left when we look at what's happened to hospitality, retail, et cetera. So that gives you a sense of where that is.  Now residential last year at 24% is a relatively high number. That's probably the highest single res number that we've ever seen. To give you a sense of what it looked like, at absolute May here, it’s about 7%. Now what's happening is we're seeing res at 24% of our volume, but we're not seeing residential starts at a particularly high level, at least relative to a 50-year snapshot of it. What I think is most telling is back to the portion of the dialogue that we had before relative to what's happening with single-family residential within the overall residential snapshot.  In the recovery that ended with COVID's arrival, single-family housing was about 67% of overall housing activity. If we look at, what, 20, 30-year averages, it tends to be closer to 80%. That's what we're starting to see today. So again, as we think about what end uses look like on a percentage basis for '20 and the way that we think they're trending for '21, again, infrastructure, 36% in '20; non-res, 36%; res, 24%. As we move into '21, should we see infrastructure move up? I think we probably should. Will we see non-res move around a little bit, but probably not huge numbers? Probably so. Do we think res will be pretty consistent? The answer is yes. I also think it's worth noting that the railroads have said that they intend to be back to relatively normal levels of maintenance and repair as we come into the year. That's important because the ChemRock and Rail portion of our business, which covers not only the rail portion but what we sell to farmers as agricultural line in the Midwestern United States can be 8%, 9%, 10% portion of our business. As agricultural prices have continued to get better, our outlook for ag line, I think, will continue to improve. So Courtney, I threw a lot of data at you for the first time on the call. I apologize for that, but I hope that was helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. 
Garik Shmois : Ward, given your optimism in new infrastructure spending going through in the middle of the year, some of the large growth figures associated with it, how should we think about the timing around the new funding showing up in your volumes? Is it unrealistic to think that it could be a 2022 driver or is it more 2023? And can you speak to the DOTs’ maybe ability to handle such a potential step-up in funding? Is there enough capacity to handle increase in revenue? It's a good problem to have, just kind of wondering how quickly you can see this benefit you?
Howard Nye: No, I agree, Garik. I think those are great questions. So I would say several things. One, I do think most DOTs today have utilized their engineering and planning and eminent domain resources over the last several years to have themselves in a position that they're better placed than I would say at any time in my career to be able to take these funds and move with them. And I think part of that is going to be underscored by what they're going to be doing with the COVID relief dollars they've got as well. I mean to give you a sense of it, if we look at the COVID relief dollars all by themselves, out of the $10 billion, we're looking at $900 million, million to Texas; $134 million to Colorado; $260 million to North Carolina; Georgia is getting $323 million; Florida is getting $473 million; Iowa, $123 million; Indiana, $238 million; South Carolina, $167 million; Maryland, $150 million; and Nebraska, $72 million. So those are nice, big numbers going to those states.  So if we look at what they're going to be able to do with that in '21, we think they're going to be able to put most of that to work. To the extent that we see a highway bill that is in some form of pass by the time we get, let's call it, toward half year, we believe you start seeing some degree of pull-through in that in '22. But we equally believe what you're going to see is a nice built from that in '22. And we believe that's going to give at least the single biggest, most consistent in use that we have a nice multi-year run.  What I think can happen, Garik, is this notion of having perhaps infrastructure funding at levels that we haven't seen ever before and the nicest increase that we've seen in 15 years, together with what we feel like in our footprint is going to be a continued expansion in single-family housing and then also following these corridors of commerce that we've so intentionally built our business around, we think it does set the industry generally up but we think it set Martin Marietta specifically up for what could be a very nice multi-year volume trend. So Garik, I hope that was helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer : Hey, Ward, when you think about M&A, how open would you be to buying a vertically integrated company versus pure-play aggregates?
Howard Nye: Adam, good morning, it's good to hear your voice. I guess what I would say, Adam, is it all depends on the player. We're specifically driven by markets, what we think are attractive markets, the position that we would have in that market and what we think we can do with the business. So here's the way I would encourage you to think about that. When we swapped out of the River business, when we swapped out of a pure stone business and we swapped into a vertically integrated marketplace, we didn't do that on that day because we lost any conviction in aggregates. This is an aggregates-led company. So what you should always expect us to do, wherever we're looking at M&A is for it to be aggregates-led. That's the important thing to remember. But what I think you and I recognize is there are some markets in the United States that do tend to be vertically integrated. And if you want to be in an attractive market that's vertically integrated, you better be in a position that you have competencies around stone, and at times, ready-mix, and at times, hot mix asphalt.  So would we consider it? Of course, we would consider it. But are we going to be very picky about the market? We will. And I think what you've seen from our track record is when we go and do that, what we've been able to do is add considerable shareholder value in the process.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Roger from Exane BNP Paribas. 
Paul Roger : I think most of the questions have been asked. I've just a follow-up on the downstream side of the business. I think if we look historically, downstream pricing and margins tend to be a bit more volatile than cement and aggregates. And historically, I've struggled a little bit if hydrocarbon costs are going up. Looking at your range and the middle of the guidance, it looks like you're expecting sort of flat margins this year. And I just wonder if you can comment on what gives you confidence that, that will be achievable in, particularly in ready-mix?
Howard Nye: Paul, thank you very much for the questions. It's good to hear your voice, and hope you're well in the UK. Paul, I think if we look at where our downstream businesses are, that's what gives us the confidence in those. Keep in mind, we have downstream businesses in Colorado where we have ready-mix and we have asphalt, and we have downstream in Texas where we have ready-mix only. And I think what we're seeing is, particularly in Texas, a good amount of bidding not only on private work that's tied into residential but also in public work on some large projects. So as we look at what we believe is happening in that marketplace, even despite what can be some of the raw materials cost particularly on the energy side, I think we feel like that we can maintain those. Equally, if we look at our business in Colorado, that's really one of the better ready-mix markets in the United States. We see actually a pretty significant delta in ready-mix pricing in Colorado versus what we see in ready-mix pricing in most of Texas. And again, the hot mix asphalt and paving business that we have in Colorado, I think, is really one of the better hot mix asphalt and pavement businesses in the United States. It's got very high barriers to entry in that marketplace. And part of what we're seeing in that marketplace, too, although we're not experiencing it, but others are, Paul. There are some depletion scenarios on stone that are underway in portions of the front range. Martin Marietta is not affected by that.  We've got nice long-term reserve positions. But what we've done in that marketplace to, one, have good long-term reserve positions; but number two, make sure we have a nicely spread out distribution system is what's going to allow us to maintain margins in those downstream businesses. At the same time, part of what you'll see, if you look at the downstream businesses, is the raw materials piece of it does appear to be going up. And in large measure, that's because we're selling ourselves some raw materials in those businesses. And we recognize that the value of aggregates is very valuable, and it's getting more valuable each year. And we're going to make sure that even when we're doing those internally, we're doing it in a very equitable fashion because we want to treat our internal customers and our external customers exactly the same way, Paul. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. 
Stanley Elliott : A question for you. With the change in administration, do you guys see anything working through the committees on the regulatory environment that would either add cost to the process, maybe slowdown in the construction markets at all? And then kind of a more broad thought, with the discussions around a $15 minimum wage, not really for you all, but for the customer contractor, what sort of disruptions that might cause, if any?
Howard Nye: Yes. Great question, Stanley. The fact is we haven't seen anything coming through right now that we feel like it's going to be widely disruptive to what we're doing. I do think we're going to see considerably more ESG factors built into maybe not one big bill. I think you're going to see it built into most bills that come through. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. If you think of it from this perspective. One, a lot of it's going to be geared towards safety activities. You can see what our numbers are. We do that extraordinarily well. The other thing that I would tell you, you can go and look at the sustainability report that we put out, what you'll find out is that to the extent that we have greenhouse gases, we have 400 operations across the United States. Really, only 4 of them have any degree of notable GHG issues and that means 84% of our GHG issues come from 4 locations, which tell us that we've already set out really robust targets between now and 2030 on how we intend to deal with those, and we publish those annually.  So as we're sitting here and looking at what we feel like could be a higher regulatory market, we don't feel like we're seeing things right now that will be negatively impacting our business. Do I think it might make barriers to entry more difficult in our business, in the back? It may. Is that something to lament? I'll leave that to you. If you've got 90 years of reserves at current extraction rates, I'm not sure that's something that we're particularly concerned about today. The other thing that I will say is, to the extent that it increases costs, the simple fact is we can usually deal with that on the commercial side because we would typically see pricing going up. And the other thing that I would say is at least right now, our customer base is not complaining about a lack of available employees. What you remember, Stanley, is a couple of years ago, there was a trucking shortage. There was a labor shortage. Right now, we're not seeing that in our space. So logistics are working relatively well, and contractors are in a position that they can do what they need to with their projects day in and day out. So hopefully, that tick off the items that you listed, Stanley?
Stanley Elliott : You sure did. And you guys really do have a nice safety record. So congrats on that and best of luck the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth from Truist Securities.
Rohit Seth : Just getting on something you mentioned in the last question. Back in 2018, we had a pretty sharp spike in inflation in the second quarter. And the fiscal stimulus that we have out there today, there could be some supply tightness out there. I'm just curious, how do you plan on defending your margins should that reoccur in the second quarter this year?
Howard Nye: Well, Rohit, it's good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. If you go across our footprint and you look at what cost of goods sold look like for us, the primary thing that you're going to see is the single biggest cost of goods sold that we have is labor. It's our employees. Then you're going to find a series of others that tend to be in the aggregates business around 12% to 15% of our COGS. That will be things like supplies, other inventories, what's happening with respect to maintenance and repair, et cetera. So if we go back over time and look at what we have done relative to our employee base, the way that we pay them, the tenure that they have, we don't see an inflation situation relative to wages that is anything that we're concerned about.  With respect to maintenance and repair, what you'll see as well is if you go over let's call it the SOAR years, you'll find that we've been very consistent with the way that we deployed capital in our business. What you'll see from that is the continuing thoughtful management of maintenance and repair.  Now one thing that you will see that went up a bit last year is some degrees of DD&A. And DD&A was up in large measure due to what we have done to invest responsibly in the business. So the one item -- and I'll ask Jim to speak to it very specifically, that we think could be a bit of a headwind this year is relative to energy and more specifically with respect to diesel fuel. Because clearly, we've seen that move around a little bit. Diesel fuel was a fairly notable tailwind for our company and for our industry all during 2020 that persisted into Q4. So I'll ask Jim to speak to that.  The other thing I'll ask Jim to speak to is what we saw relative to the sale of some excess properties last year that will likely not repeat. So I think from a inflation perspective, that's going to talk you about energy, but I also want you modeling to be thinking about what we're not going to do or at least replicate relative to land sales.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Sure. So we've got currently forecasted a headwind of $30 million for higher diesel in 2021. WTI is, I think, $58 per barrel, I think I saw this morning. That's the average price that was out there in 2019. So effectively, we're going back to that level of diesel pricing as far as we can tell. So that's already in the forecast. And frankly, that we're holding on to our margins from 2020 and slightly building on those. So we're content in that environment to maintain margins and then offset diesel pricing.  As it relates to the land sale gains that Ward referred to, we had those very large gains in 2020, $70 million worth of gains. Those were hard thought and very much enjoyed, but they are not going to be repeating this year. So as you model out your numbers, we just ask that you look at 2020 EBITDA as a core, maybe pull up as land sale gains and not build on those as repeating into 2021.
Rohit Seth : Understood. And then on transportation costs, I'm seeing trucking costs going up a bit. What are you thinking there? Is that just a nominal grower? Or are you seeing any above normal growth there?
Howard Nye: No. Look, I think we'll just see some fairly typical growth in transportation. We're not particularly troubled by that. And keep in mind, most of the transportation, particularly on the quarry side, we're selling stone to quarry. So we're counting on the customers to make transportation arrangements. And typically, when they pick up the stone, risk of loss leaves us as it goes up the scales.
Rohit Seth : Understood. So in 2Q '18, it was really just about -- it was diesel and transportation, but there's nothing else to really think about.
Howard Nye: I think that's entirely correct, Rohit.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson from Raymond James. 
Josh Wilson : Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to make extra sure I understood the Cement margin commentary. I understand the year-on-year comparability issues with the outage. But it looks like the margin actually declines between the low and the high end of your guidance. Can you elaborate on maybe if there's some costs you would bring back at businesses at the high end of your expectations?
Howard Nye: Let me ask Jim to respond to that. But yes, go ahead, Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. From a cost perspective, natural gas is one of our inputs for fuel. That was pretty benign in 2020. We're forecasting that cost to go up slightly in 2021, and that's where you're seeing the margin slightly degrade year-over-year. Does that answer your question?
Josh Wilson : I was talking about the high and the low end of the '21 guidance.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Well, the natural gas -- I talk about revenues or margins?
Josh Wilson : Margins.
Jim Nickolas: Margins. Yes. So natural gas is an input for our Cement business to fire the kiln, and we're forecasting those costs to go up.
Howard Nye: So what's going to happen as a practical matter, Josh. If we look at energy overall for the aggregates business, it's going to tend to be about 12%. And of that, diesel fuel is going to be about 8% of that. When we look at energy overall for the Cement business, it's a much larger percentage of the overall cost of goods sold for Cement. And it's tending to be in the 20% range for overall energy. So I think that probably helps bridge that a bit for you.
Josh Wilson : And if I could just sneak in one other. Your CapEx guidance is about the same as you initially started in 2020. Is that a good long-term number as well as we think about the cash potential as we get into an infrastructure bill?
Jim Nickolas: I think it is. We had started out there last year, as you pointed out. And then COVID brought in the level of uncertainty, and we pulled back quite a bit on CapEx 2020. We restored it in 2021. I think 9% -- 8% to 10% of sales is a rough proxy of where our CapEx sits. So you can kind of scale as the business grows, our CapEx will grow accordingly. So $450 million is probably not a bad number to be at. It's a little bit higher than we've been at recently. But again, we brought it down in 2020. So it’s quite not a bad number to be at going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. 
Timna Tanners : I'm sure you'll talk about this also at your upcoming Investor Day. But the big thing that sticks out to me in looking at your high-quality problem of these very strong cash flows is what you're going to do with them going forward. So I just wondered if you could just remind us of your priorities. It sounds like you're excited about M&A. You do have a little more CapEx you just talked about. But what does it take for the Board to consider more buybacks or increased dividend? If you could just remind us about that?
Howard Nye: Happy to, Timna. So thank you so much for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Our capital priorities haven't changed, and that is the -- we feel like the best first on our spend is on the right transaction. And several years ago, I remember, we were coming into a year and we said that we thought it could be a year of some notable transactions for the industry. I think the prospect is this could be a year of some notable transactions. We've tried to have ourselves financially and regulatorily in a position that if large transactions or notable transactions or attractive ones came along, we would be in a place that we could play. So if we think about our best first dollar spent, that's it.  Next, we're looking at assuring that we're investing responsively in the business. And if you look at what we've been able to do through cycles relative to CapEx, and as Jim was just indicating, we think we have treated the business really quite well. And if we look at what that has allowed us to do relative to our cost performance, we think that we have been largely outperforming. And then third, to your point, and your very good question is, a return of cash to shareholders. And we've done that through two very different ways, Timna. Number one, we've had a meaningful and a sustainable dividend. And we think both of those words are really important.  So one thing to keep in mind, I believe we're the only heavy side building materials company who can say this, we've never cut a dividend. So the fact is, we've been able to maintain a dividend all the way through cycles. And what's important is this company, even in August, when the world was faced with all the uncertainties from COVID-19, we raised our dividend by 4%. And if you go back and look at where we were the year before that or the year before that, you'll find even bigger increases. So clearly, our Board is going to come back and look at the dividend in August.  As you’ll recall as well, when we bought TXI, we issued 20 million shares of stock to combine the companies together. Shortly after that, our Board took the view, okay, our shareholders were good enough to give us license to go and do this with a very high percentage shareholder vote. We're going to make sure over time, opportunistically, we come back and take that dilution back. And we've been on that journey. We've got about 15 million shares left in that authorization. We want to continue chipping away on that. But the conversations we've had with our shareholders have tended to be, if you have the ability to do the right deal, that's where we want you to be. And these are conversations that we're always very frontal with our shareholders because they're our owners at the end of the day. And we want to make sure that we're meeting their needs and their expectations. But that's the priorities. That's how we're looking at it, Timna. So again, I hope that's helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan.
Adrian Huerta : Yes. Most of my questions were answered, but just very quickly on -- if you can comment a little bit on how the first quarter is looking. I mean, usually, we see volumes down sequentially 10% to 15% in the first quarter. Yes -- but we are ending with a very strong volume in the fourth quarter. Given what you have seen so far with whether it's an activity, et cetera, can we expect at least the same guidance that we have seen in the past?
Howard Nye: Adrian, I really appreciate the question, and it's a good one because here's the dichotomy that we find ourselves in. Last year when most companies were withdrawing guidance, they were certainly encouraged to be forward-leaning and be even more forthcoming into what they might see in the coming months. Part of what we're so pleased with is we feel like we're back in a more normalized state, trending to an even more normalized state, and because of that, we've reinstituted guidance. And our practice has always been, if we had guidance in place to make sure that we were really sticking very close within the four-walls of the quarter in which we're addressing. So I'll talk a little bit -- well, I'll talk a lot more about January when we're together and we're reporting the full -- the quarter results. I'll say this much, part of what we thought was important, was ending the year with momentum, and we thought that we would see it carry into the year. So we'll talk more about the first quarter when we come up with results. But I wanted to give you a sense of why, unlike at least the last two calls, we're not rushing to talk about the month that we're in right now.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research.
Michael Dudas : So Ward, just quickly, you mentioned about the $10 billion in the allocations there in certain states on the relief funds, the DOTs. And some pretty good numbers for some of the states that are not in your top five. What are the 2 or 3 area or states you look at going and you look at the plan of 2020 that could be generating positive surprises from you generally in the business and maybe more so if some of that funding were to flow more aggressively into those states on the infrastructure side?
Howard Nye: Look, thank you very much for the question. I think 2 states that we'll particularly watch and they were important states to us last year. And candidly, they don't get depressed, but they should. Indiana had a fantastic year last year. The management team that we have there just ran that business like a Swiss watch last year. And Indiana is getting $238 million more, and they've got a very good highway program there. The other business that performed extraordinarily well last year, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, is the business that we have in Maryland in the aftermath of the Bluegrass transaction. Again, Maryland got $150 million coming into that marketplace as well.  So we've talked about how important Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida are, those are 1 through 5. But again, if we see the type of performance, I think we can expect to see in Indiana and what we might see in Maryland, those could be some very nice surprises coming into 2021. I'm not even sure we'd say surprises, but I think that could give some potential nice upside. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman : Ward, just a question on the North Carolina public sector, in particular, just because the deficit in whole and lettings last year was so significant, do you feel like you've already felt the brunt of that in the business? Are you anticipating the spillover effect from that, recognizing that obviously, it's in recovery and lettings have forecast to pick up this year? Just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the spillover into '21?
Howard Nye: No, I think that's a great question, Brent. I would say several things. One, we went into '20 with some of the best backlogs we've ever had in North Carolina. And so that allowed us to weather a pretty challenging time in our State. Now I'm probably going to jinx this right now, so I shouldn't say this, but right now, we've had no harsh winter weather in North Carolina either, which means let's face it. At the end of the day, we really don't want to see DOT having to move snow off roads in North Carolina. So I think it's a practical matter of seeing resurfacing projects go, seeing the $700 million from billed NC bonds and utilizing that and a much healthier bidding circumstance on top of the backlogs that we have, make weathering what we've already done much better. And I think it does outline a much brighter 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond in North Carolina.  So we feel like we have been through the toughest period by far. And that we're going to see the State begin to perform much more in line with what our historical expectations would have been. So Brent, I hope that helps.
Howard Nye: Well, thank you all for joining our earnings conference call today. Built on our solid foundation of past successes, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to drive continued sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2021 results in a few months, and importantly, sharing our strategic priorities with you at our coming Investor Day on February 25. Registration details for this virtual event will be available soon. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time, for your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, I'll be today's coordinator. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the Company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors Relation section of our website, Q3 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Effective July 1, in connection with our streamlining our operating structure, we also changed our reportable segments. Our Building Materials business now consists of the East Group, whose operations were previously reported in the Mid-America and Southeast groups, and the West Group, which had no significant changes. In addition, the Magnesia Specialties business comprises our third reportable segment, prior year results have been revised to conform with this new reporting structure. Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance and market trends as we move toward 2021. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Martin Marietta's strong business execution and commitment to operational excellence provide the foundation for our company to consistently deliver record financial, operational and safety performance. As highlighted in today's release, we established new profitability and safety records for the first nine months of 2020. Year-to-date, gross profit increased to $927 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, surpassed the $1 billion mark. We have also achieved the best safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with the company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding world-class levels. For the third quarter, increased pricing across all product lines and disciplined cost management help mitigate anticipated shipment declines driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter financial highlights as compared with the prior-year period included, consolidated gross margin increased 100 basis points to a record 30.6%, despite a 7% reduction in revenues, demonstrating the resiliency of our business and our focus on cost control. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to an industry-leading 5.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was $502 million inclusive of $70 million of non-recurring gains, and diluted earnings per share was $4.71. For clarity, the non-recurring gains contributed $0.87 per diluted share. These results are a testament to our dedicated and talented employees who are managing through today's challenging public health and economic environment, as well as the proactive steps we've taken to adjust the company's cost profile. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance, aggregates shipments declined nearly 9% versus a robust prior-year comparison. As anticipated, given the widespread COVID-19 disruptions across the United States, shipment declines were experienced across our footprint with the East Group down 9% and the West Group down 8%. Additionally, the East Group shipments were impacted by weather delayed projects in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina and reduced wind energy activity in Iowa. Wet weather in Texas and lower energy sector demand negatively impacted West Group shipments. In line with broader macroeconomic trends, aggregates shipments to both the infrastructure and non-residential markets declined, shipments to the residential market improved modestly. Aggregates average selling price increased 2.7% or 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, underscoring this product lines resilient pricing power. By region, the East Group posted a 4.4% pricing increase with strength in our key geographies of North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana and Maryland. The West Group average selling price declined slightly reflecting a lower percentage of higher priced shipments from distribution yards. We continue to see attractive pricing in both Texas and Colorado. On a mix-adjusted basis, the West Group average selling price improved nearly 4%. As a reminder, we anticipate overall full year 2020 aggregates pricing growth of 3% to 4%. Underlying demand for our Texas-based cement business remains positive supported by diversified customer backlogs and large project activity. Third quarter cement shipments, however, decreased 4%, reflecting continued energy sector headwinds. Reported cement pricing increased 1% while average selling prices for our core cement products, namely Type 1 and Type 2 cement were up $4 over the prior-year period, lower shipments of oil well and lightweight specialty cements bound for West Texas disproportionately impacted overall pricing growth. As a reminder, specialty cements can sell for over $200 per ton. On a mix-adjusted basis, overall cement pricing increased 3.4%. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 4% excluding acquired shipments and third quarter 2019 shipments from our Southwest Division's Concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas which we divested earlier this year. Texas construction activity was hindered by wet weather. By contrast, Colorado shipments benefited from favorable weather and continued activity on a large Amazon performance there. Favorable geographic mix from robust Colorado shipments was the primary driver of the 2% increase in third quarter concrete price. Asphalt shipments for our Colorado asphalt and paving business decreased 3% following near record levels in the prior year period. Asphalt pricing increased 6%, reflecting a higher percentage of attractively priced specialty asphalt mixed sales. For our Magnesia Specialties business, weakness in chemicals and lime demand began to moderate during the quarter, as steel utilization rebounded from June’s trough. We expect continued improvement through the balance of the year. Before discussing our preliminary 2021 outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim?
James Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to all. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business delivered products and services revenues of $1.2 billion, a 6% decrease from the prior year period and product gross profit of $384 million, a 3% decrease. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis point to 36.4% an all-time record despite lower shipment volume. Strong mix adjusted pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs contributed to 6.5% growth in aggregates unit profitability. These results demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. Cement product gross margin was 40.2%, a 40 basis point decline. Despite lower revenues, the Cement business benefited from lower fuel cost and prior year tail investments that have improved reliability and throughput. For our downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete product gross margin declined 90 basis, 9.7% attributable, the higher cost to raw material. Asphalt and paving achieved record gross profit of $32 million and a 140 basis point improvement margin despite lower revenue. Magnesia Specialties third quarter product revenues decreased 7% to $55 million reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. So revenues and reduced fixed cost absorption resulted in a 240 basis point decline and product gross margin to 38%. Our consolidated results included $70 million of gains on surplus from non-core land sales and divested assets. These gains, which were recorded in other operating income net are non-recurring and should not be extrapolated in a run-rate calculation. As a reminder, surplus land sales were part of the value proposition of our TXI acquisition and that's exactly what you see in this quarter. Since 2016, we have sold nearly $200 million of excess land that was not used for operations and did not contain operating assets. While we cannot predict the timing of any future land sales, we expect additional non-core real estate divestitures as favorable opportunities develop. We achieved the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history, both inclusive and exclusive of the previously discussed non-recurring gains. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion inclusive of the $7 million non-recurring gains for full year 2020. Now, turning to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions and prudent organic capital investment and a consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. In August, we acquired an aggregates and ready-mix concrete company in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. These acquired operations complement our existing geographic footprint and expand our customer base. We also enhance our aggregates and cement throughput to drive incremental upstream value. We have widened our full year capital expenditures guidance and now expect it to range from $350 million to $400 million. We are exploring additional lifetime exchange opportunities that was defer the taxes we would otherwise pay on this year's sizable land sales. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases in meaningful, sustainable dividend. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and cash generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.28. Share repurchase activity remain temporary pause during the quarter. However, repurchases can resume at management's discretion. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 times, we were at the lower end of our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times. We remain confident in our balance sheet strength with $1.2 billion total liquidity. With our low leverage and ample liquidity, we retain the financial flexibility to continue to profitably grow our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for his market trends commentary and preliminary outlooks for 2021.
Howard Nye: Thanks Jim. We're confident that our favorable pricing dynamics will continue and that attractive underlying fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends across our key geographies will remain intact. To offer some specific color on how this is playing out, it's notable that both our upstream and downstream businesses have seen improvements in daily shipment trends since July lows with October average data shipments above prior year levels. While we're cautiously optimistic about these trends, we believe COVID-19 related uncertainty will likely persist through the winter and spring season. Keeping that in mind, we currently anticipate product demand will remain modest through the first half of 2021 and product pricing will remain strong. As the U.S. economy resets from COVID-19 disruptions, the longer-term macroeconomic indicators such as undeveloped conditions, historically low interest rates and hourly workforce availability are favorable and should support a construction-led recovery. We're seeing encouraging long-term trends across our three primary end use markets and key geographies, including bipartisan support for robust multi-year federal surface transportation reauthorization, heavy industrial activity to support e-commerce and remote work needs and single-family housing expansion, driven by accelerated de-organization. We believe these trends bode well for more aggregates intensive construction cycle that experience during the slow but steady recovery from the Great Recession. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets continues to be resilient. With gas and tax sales revenue shortfalls less than originally anticipated, State Departments of Transportation or DOT budgets are in better condition than expected at the pandemics onset. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021 which began September 1 are currently planned at $10 billion, an increase of 35% over the comparable fiscal year 2020 lettings. Updated Colorado DOT projections indicate relatively flat transportation spending levels for 2021 and North Carolina DOT which temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues and other factors, recently revised its letting schedule upward and resume bidding for resurfacing work earlier this month. As a reminder, these three key states represent over 60% of our Building Materials business revenues. On the federal front, the President recently signed into law a continuing resolution that included a one-year extension at the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels which was consistent with our expectations. In our view, this provides state and local governments, the visibility needed to plan, design and let transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Over the medium to long-term future, we expect the industry to benefit from the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal surface transportation package which we anticipate will be enacted by mid-2021. Both the United States House and Senate have advanced federal highway legislation, underscoring bipartisan support to remedy the nation's crumbling surface transportation infrastructure. Notably, both those provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15 years. Regardless of the upcoming election outcomes, increased infrastructure investment, it should provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments closer to 45% of our total shipments moving us toward our 10-year historical average. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 38% of third quarter shipments. Although certain sectors of non-residential construction remained challenged in the near-term, COVID-19 is driving a paradigm shift that should promote more diverse non-residential demand from the previous cycle, fueling long-term aggregates growth. Accelerating technology, e-commerce and remote work trends require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers which are generally more aggregates intensive than by commercial construction due to the size and scale of these projects. Importantly, we have purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure over the last 10 years or so to be more heavily industrially focused as we've expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Additionally, light commercial construction, despite its current weak demand should benefit in the longer-term from the drag along effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments at the non-residential market accounted for 33% of third quarter shipments. Single-family housing is expected to lead this economic recovery as the organization accelerates. Prospective homebuyers are increasingly moving from large metropolitan cities to smaller metro or suburban areas with the pandemic. Recently, North Carolina, our third largest state by revenues, was identified as a top migration destination ranking number seven among states that experienced the most inbound moves from March through August of this year, according to data from United Van Lines. These trends extend beyond those moving from one state to another. They also include existing restaurants opting to move farther out from city centers. Across our Southeastern and Southwestern footprint, under those conditions and favorable population and unemployment dynamics provide Martin Marietta with a distinct competitive advantage for outsized secular growth in single-family housing development. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times the aggregates intensity, but multi-family housing, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregate shipments to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter shipments. In summary, as our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, navigating challenging times and emerging from them stronger are hallmarks of our company. We've executed a thoughtful strategy and taken deliberate steps to position Martin Marietta as a resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. We will continue to do what we do best. Manage our business safely and responsibly, ensuring that we're prepared to seize profitable growth opportunities for the benefit of our stakeholders. Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. With our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and best in-class teams, we are excited about our bright prospects for driving long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value in the fourth quarter, in 2021 and well into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: Well, thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the color. And really, I want to dive in first on the aggregates margins. I mean, very strong, especially given the lower volume and also, one of your highest priced highest market states, North Carolina is pretty challenged, so pretty strong there. And so, Ward, could you update us on maybe some of the cost tailwinds that you're seeing in the aggregates business? Clearly diesel but it seems like there is much more at work here and how do you think about the sustainability?
Howard Nye: Trey, thanks for the question. No, you are entirely right to put up these numbers, but as you said, North Carolina is not at peak of its game right now, we think it's going to be back to normal, by the way mid half year, next year, but what we've done in this very impressive quarter is done a good by arm and half tied behind our back because North Carolina is down, but it's not going to stay down. Then Magnesia Specialties is going through the foot moral right now, but it's not going to stay down either. So what you're seeing is really a two-fold impact Trey, one, pricing was very good and that's something that we come to expect and you come to expect as have our shareholders. So there are no surprises there. It's nice to see it performing in resilient fashion. Again, one of your closed down to double-digits on volume. But to your point, I think what we're really seeing, even separate and distinct from the energy piece of it, is very good cost performance and that's something that our team has been focused on, it's nothing that's new to Martin Marietta, you can see it also in the SG&A numbers. But if I go through and look at where we'll be not just in energy, but where we'll be relative to contract services, repairs, supplies, and other plant costs, all down, and that's exactly what we would anticipate. As you recall, Trey, we've gone through cycles. We tend to invest very carefully in our company. And when we were going through the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we did pull back on CapEx. At the same time in the last few years, we've taken CapEx up and that has truly been an investment in our business. So what we're seeing the benefits of is a better cost profile, operational excellence, cost performance across the spectrum that we would anticipate. And the other thing that's important, Trey, is the way that we've grown our business. So when we've added businesses as we have in Colorado and what we've done in Texas with TXI and what you're seeing from excess real estate sales and similarly, what we've done with Bluegrass, these have all been enhancing this organization, but it's truly aggregates led and you're seeing good performance come through on the cost side, which again is exactly what we would have expected. And the thing that I've really enjoyed and I am so grateful with this team on is continuing to show their agility and being able to manage that on the fly and as they would need. We're always going to remember 2020 as the year that could have been, because if you're seeing this type of performance with volumes down, you can imagine what I believe we'd be doing this year if we were not in the midst of the pandemic.
Trey Grooms: Thanks, Ward, that's encouraging and helpful. So my follow-up product demand. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting to be modest through the first half of '21 and pricing will remain strong. Could you go into any more color there for next year, maybe a high-level look at the end markets? And does this imply a return to volume growth in the back half or an acceleration, what's the - what's your messaging there?
Howard Nye: Trey, that's another great question. I would say several things. I would think in the back half, which is certainly big calling towards volume growth. I mean, here we are in Q3, which is the single largest quarter for the industry, it's the largest quarter for Martin Marietta, and we're down 9%. So, I would expect, in half through next year, we are seeing growth. Keep in mind, half - quarter one is really a rather inconsequential quarter. There is very little volume that goes in Q1. The season really begins in earnest for a business like ours in May because that's when you'll have everything open across an enterprise including those parts of the country, it tend to be more weather-affected. So what I say on a comparative basis, Q1 would be a tough compare, yes, but it's not going to be huge tonnage. As a practical matter, the pandemic really started settling in as we went into Q2. But I would think, when we get to the back half of next year we should start to see the economy grow in some ways. I do think the deurbanization trends that we're seeing, will help us nicely on housing. I think Martin Marietta is going to be a very nice beneficiary of that because you saw the data that I revealed even on North Carolina relative to United Van Lines data, but that same data is true for Georgia, and it's true for Florida, and it's true for Texas, and it's true for Colorado. And again, when we start going through those impacts states, it matters. I think that's something that's real, and we're going launch we go into 2021. The other thing that I would say relative to 2021, Trey, is infrastructure looks a lot better today than we thought, infrastructure was going to look when we were half year. So, if we look back at even for a tech stocks, so they were going to be at half year as they were thinking about 2021. They were $7.5 billion, so they've got a 10 handle in front of that today. We're looking at a state like Colorado, they're saying it's going to be relatively flat, and we know our third largest state by revenue in North Carolina is going to be better, when we get into the second half of the calendar year of 2021. Remember these states work on fiscal years that in large part end on June 30. I think the end use that's going to be the one that we need to watch most carefully is not a surprise to anyone, it's going to be non-residential. And I think you're going to have a tale of two different stories in non-res. I think the heavy side of it, Trey, is going to be pretty good. I mean, I'll give you a sense of it. In the Greater San Antonio area all by itself right now, we are bidding on right for six different Amazon fulfillment centers just in that marketplace. So, we're looking at heavy side non-res in states where we have very intentionally built our business. We think that's going to look attractive. So whether it's data warehousing, warehousing or otherwise, we think that's going to be good. And I do think hospitality is going to be challenged for a while. I think vary degrees of energy on a comparative basis are going to be challenged for a little while and I think office and retail will as well. But here's what I would say, if the housing trends continued the way that we believe that they will, and we believe it's going to be more single-family driven, we're going to see homebuilders buying more land, we're going to see them entitling that land and we're going to see the drag along effect hopefully not in '21 but probably more going into '22 of the light portion of non-res. So what I'll try to do Trey, in response to your question is, go through those three primary end users that we have and speak to at least what we're seeing relative to trends right now. Obviously, when we come out with our full year results in February, then you get the more precise guidance. We'll get much more granularity to that, but again my commentary saying that this October compared to last October looks pretty good. We like that as a data point.
Trey Grooms: Absolutely. Well, thanks for taking my questions. I do want to say one last thing though. I think this goes overlooked sometimes by the analyst and investor community, but I did want to call out the safety record that you guys have achieved, I mean blasting rock and working around heavy equipment can be a dangerous business, so hats off to you on that achievement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Thompson: First, focusing on the Cement segment, could you give some more color on the backlogs for this segment, particularly when you look over the next 12 months? And what does this mean for pricing environment, given it was, needless to say, an unusual year this year for pricing? Thanks.
Howard Nye: No, look, you're right, it's been an unusual year but at the same time, what I'd say Kathryn is, pricing, if we're really looking cement segments it's up 3.4%. So pricing in cement, in Texas is behaving like aggregates. And keep in mind, that's something that we've long said we thought it would be the case. If we look at our cement backlogs, I'll tell you that that's one of the great stories because we're seeing cement backlogs up 24% on strong infrastructure bookings and primarily a large job that Tesla has going on in the Austin area and some property that we sold them. So the backlog situation looks quite good there. And actually the pricing was pretty good, Kathryn. If you look at it, the optics, the pricing and the reality of them are two very different things. Because the reality is, energy sector sales for us, which are not a big amount of tons were down 74% in West Texas. So a big percentage, but small tons. But the reason that's so important and we call it out in the prepared comments, that's where that cement sales were over $200 a ton. So if we're coming back and just looking at Type 1 and Type 2 cement in San Antonio and in Dallas, those numbers are actually up very nicely, and we think that that's likely what we're going to see next year as well. Now, in fairness, we have said that we're going to take cement pricing up in April of next year and we have a letter out to that effect right now and we're talking about $9 in that Texas marketplace next year. So I think that gives you a sense of how pricing has behaved this year, what has been the mix effect on it, what this Type 1 and Type 2 look like. The other thing that I'll note Kathryn, because this is important too, is we have continued to see efficiency improvement quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in our cement business. So kind of what I would call out for you is volume is down, but the cement EBITDA in Q3, the margin of 46.2%, represents actually a new quarterly record. So we're getting it both ways, we're doing it the hard way on costs, but we're doing it the other way on pricing as well, but again backlogs up 23%. We're a little bit over 270,000 tons.
Kathryn Thompson: And then the follow-up question is more on the infrastructure side, particularly with state DOTs. You have confirmed that in all of the Gulf issues, that the worst appears to be behind for North Carolina. Could you - just got to confirm what gives you optimism for that, but also looking at other key states like Georgia, who is still continuing to move along and Texas and other key markets that are important for you, from an infrastructure standpoint. Particularly against the backdrop of how they are looking into next year? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure. Happy to, couple of things. One, Texas, I'll just go through them in order of revenues. So Texas has huge FY '20, '21 lettings of $10.2 billion, we spoke about that just a minute ago. That's going to have a multi-year benefit to Martin Marietta. Our backlogs in that state are up in all three product lines and we see some very large projects coming in 2021. What's important to our members across seven funding is currently projected at a full $2.5 billion, even as we're looking at cropped one that's looking at $620 million. And keep in mind, none of that anticipates Texas having to tap into their $10 billion rainy day funds. So again, Texas feels very healthy even compared to where we were half year. Colorado looks pretty flattish and that's what we are expecting. We see construction activity there that's being supported by about a $1.8 billion four-year bond program. Two years remain on that and that could provide an additional $1 billion or more. So we're feeling good about where that state is, again, a nice improvement over where it was at half year. The North Carolina DOT situation that you called out very specifically and appropriately is improving. And part of what we've seen even in the last week is North Carolina mail is sending out some double A-rated bonds, they were just rated last week. It's going to be $700 million of build North Carolina bonds. And importantly, the state has started - what we started lettings and anticipates about $1.3 billion of it - of FY '21 lettings and that's pretty similar to the pre-pandemic numbers of about $1.4 billion. So again, we're feeling much better about North Carolina and that's one that we obviously stay very close to. Similarly, you asked about Georgia and we're anticipating there relatively flat DOT spending at about $2 billion. But part of what we think is important is it appears that Georgia is going to advance at least two of the major mobility projects in Atlanta. They're not going to have a '21 start, but they're likely to have a '22 start. And remember, these are major mobility projects at about $12 billion and their primary aim is to reduce congestion along key corridors in Georgia. And the last one, at least in our top five is Florida DOT, and again, we're looking at something there that we think is going to be very steady year-over-year. Keep in mind, they've got a very healthy P3 program in that state, so you've got a lot of activity in Florida. So again, if we look at our top five states and that's exactly what I've just taken you through from an infrastructure perspective, year-over-year, we like the looks of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane. Your line is open.
Paul Roger: It's Paul Roger. Yes, can you just say they - obviously, it's a big week next week with the election, can you just speak a bit about the potential implications of the different outcomes? And also, if there is a new highway bill or maybe some stimulus as well, when you think that would impact demand on the ground, is it likely to be a 2022 story?
Howard Nye: Paul, thanks for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Yes, I would say that we are one of the few industries that probably can't lose next week and here's what I mean by that. If the President is re-elected, we anticipate there is going to be a new highway bill and we think it's probably going to be up very similar to the Senate's number, that's 28% over FAST Act and that being the largest increase all by itself in 15 years. Similarly, if we should have a change in part of the White House and Mr. Biden is elected and the fact is, the democratic-controlled House is looking at a 41% increase in highway spending. So here's what I would say, if the President's re-elected, it's going up and it's going up with less regulation. If Mr. Biden is elected, it's going up with probably more regulation. And the irony of that is, we actually do pretty well with regulation. Well, we've got great teams, they are very sophisticated, they can deal with that very efficiently. So we - I believe, either way, Martin Marietta will be well-positioned. If there is more regulation, one of the things that we certainly see that drive in the past is perhaps more M&A opportunity as well, because often times, if you're looking at a higher tax, higher regulatory environment, closely-held kind of businesses start reconsidering what their long-term future is as well. So, as we sit here and anticipate what different outcomes could be, it can change the way that we're going to think about some things around the margin, but in large measure, we think under either one of those scenarios, Martin Marietta does very well.
Paul Roger: And that's very clear. I mean, within spinning your opening remarks, you inferred that this would have obviously been a fantastic year were it not the COVID. If you see a situation where we do get some volume growth again in 2021, are you basically suggesting there is a lot so if you can go on the margins? And I guess particularly if some of the more profitable market, like the Carolina's stabilized all good.
Howard Nye: Well, I would say a couple of things. One, volume will always be this industry's friend because you're going to have a certain degree of cost, but as much as we'd like to be at a flex costs as much as we can, some of them are going to be fixed, it's a big heavy industry, but I think we control cost extraordinarily well. Again, I think geography, from a mixed perspective, actually this quarter, was not particularly upper end. So, if we see these Eastern markets behaving in a more robust fashion and volume hits those markets, it could be pretty impressive relative to margin. Keep in mind, in the East this year, we saw a significant project delays and we saw extremely wet weather in what was formerly the Mid-Atlantic Division. And again, we've discussed the fact that we saw lower NCDOT funding, that's going to be remedy, and we saw most win part activity. So, if we look at that didn't happen in the East and things that we don't think will continue to recur into the future, we think that's probably very attractive for our margins. The other thing that I would say is I would not expect the cost that we have been very good at controlling this year to go backwards on us. I think the investments that we have made on capital will be our friend. Now in fairness, there is a piece of that that's tied up in energy and there are a lot of things we can control. I wish, I could tell you that we could control overall energy prices, but we can't, but at the same time, as energy has tended to move upward, keep in mind, that's also served historically as the mechanism plus to make sure that we can cover that with increased average selling prices as well. So, I do think relative to margins, geography is likely to be more of a friend, they are not going forward, and I think this is the type of cost performance that you should expect us to continue to deliver.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Ward, in your opening remarks, you were optimistic about pricing into '21, which is really interesting considering pricing typically falls volumes, and obviously we're looking at a pretty tough back half of this year and first half of '21. So could you just expand on those comments, what's enabling you to achieve the strong pricing and what have you announced the customers for '21 if I got the gist of your opening remarks right?
Howard Nye: No, you did, Jerry. I guess what I would say is that, I'm not sure if there was anything strikingly new about the observations I was making on '21. I think the primary thing that I just want to underscore is that pricing is something that we tend to do really well in Martin Marietta. When volumes go up, pricing goes up, when volumes go down, pricing still goes up. And in this quarter I thought it was pretty good, because there are not a lot of industries that could come forward with volume down line and pricing up the way that we saw pricing up this year. So I think that's the underlying theme that I want to make sure that I underscore. I think the other thing to remember, Jerry, is we're seeing that as we pointed out in some of the conversations we've had, with actually one of our higher-priced - higher profitable businesses not at the top of their game this year, because of what's not coming out of NCDOT. So again, I think we'll continue to see a good price trajectory in large part because we're in many good locations. And I think as we continue to see superfamily housing go up, that's actually an area that we tend to do quite well in housing on, because if you're thinking about people who will at least try to utilize some form of volume, on occasion, as a lever to talk to you about pricing, that's typically not the home door, because at the end of the day, there is so many things they care deeply about in the home, but the news flash is the price of crushed stone usually is not one of them. So I think if we end up seeing a new highway bill, we see the volume that we think will come from that, probably not in '21, but as practical matter coming in '22, but we see a very healthy residential market and then we see the drag along in the growth of time of the like non-res. I think all of that pretends very well for pricing. And again, if we look at those top five states that are disproportionately important to us and you look at even what's happened with cement pricing in Texas, I think that tells you that the overall marketplace is at a pretty healthy spot.
Jerry Revich: And so we're normally in this type of volume environment, I would have thought aggregates pricing should be up in the 2% range. And it sounds like, based on your comments that, you're announcing the customers is more or like the pricing we saw in '20 than what I'm describing.
Howard Nye: Well, and again, we'll give you even more granularity around that when we come out in February, because some of those conversations are still ongoing. But again, I think you get the overall sense that there is nothing in our pricing model that we feel like has been shaken by this strange time to the world navigating together.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.
Anthony Pettinari: Ward on the decision to re-establish full-year guidance, I mean is it fair to say you were surprised by the resilience you saw in your end markets or maybe some of those cost factors that boosted margins, or was it just more of a function of having one quarter left in the year? I'm just wondering if you could talk - you kind of walk us through the decision-making process and what you saw specifically that may be comfortable with re-establishing the guide.
Howard Nye: Yes, Anthony, thank you for the question. I think part of it is - you could deepen up into something that strange and you start to figure it out a little bit. So, I think candidly, that's part of it. The other - another part of it is, Anthony, there is just not that much runway left this year and we've got a pretty good sense of how October is looking. Obviously, Q4 itself can have some swing factors to it, and obviously one of them is, when does weather really set in earnest. It's been interesting Anthony, because there have been years that we have been paving almost up to Christmas in Colorado and equally, there have been years that well before Thanksgiving, it was shut down. So, obviously, we'll try to bracket but we think Q4 can like from just a volume perspective, we know what it's going to look like from a pricing perspective. And we believe we've got a pretty good handle on what it's going to look like from a cost perspective as well. So, I think those were the factors candidly that went into it and again in the conversation that I was having just a few minutes ago with Jerry and others on the end users. We're trying to get as - we are just taking a look into '21 as we can, but again, we feel pretty good about all of them.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then you talked about some of the project delays that you saw earlier in the year. I'm just wondering from a big picture perspective, the pace of project delays or cancellations that you saw over the course of the quarter, did that pace - was apparently stable or did it is ease, maybe you saw some more projects come back than you expected or any kind of general thoughts there.
Howard Nye: Yes, I would say several things. One, we see deferrals, we don't see cancellations and I think that's an important bifurcation to draw, because pushing projects to the right is an entirely different animal than calling them off. So during the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we saw projects cancel, that's not what we're seeing. So I want to call that. The other is, in some instances, we simply saw weather deferrals. So obviously, we've had some hurricanes that have come in through the Southwest this year and we've had a good bit of rain in the Southeast. But the primary place that, again, I think we're taking some good comfort is when we're seeing North Carolina DOT start re-letting some surface transportation again, in some respects for the first time in almost a year. So when we see that state beginning to return to something that feels more like in a patience, a normal start as rhythm, that certainly feels better to us. So we're - we did not see anything relative to deferrals in the quarter that we thought were extraordinary or surprised us. And in many respects, what I would say is from a volume perspective, I don't think we're very surprised this quarter. I think from a pricing perspective, we were not surprised. And I'm not going to tell you that from a cost perspective we were surprised, I would tell you, gratified, is probably the right word, but again, we expect to see more of that going into the future, not less up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Thank you for taking the question. Ward, when you talked about or talking to your residential contractors, are you getting a sense that they're actually looking to buy land now and build out new subdivisions or that, they're busy enough just keeping pace with what they are? And I am curious kind of in the context that we've heard about a lot of delays for higher lumber prices and things like that. Any thoughts to what extent that could be kind of a governor on the residential recovery into next year?
Howard Nye: Stanley, that's a great question. And what I think is this, one, they're busy and busy usually begets busy. And number two, I do think the shift that we're seeing in the Great American move - moving more away from multifamily, moving to single-family where people frankly want some space but they haven't had for the last several years is going to lead to the necessity of buying more land. And by the way, we don't think that's a bad thing. We actually think that's a good thing, because if we look at the markets in which we are operating one, they tend to have land, two, the entitlement for new subdivisions isn't something that's highly difficult to do, and three, the ability to borrow money is there. So we feel like all of that's important. The other piece of it, Stanley, that we think is important is these markets are not overbuilt and that's such a fundamentally different place. And part of what we spoke about in the half-year call is, we've seen single-family move around over the last couple of decades. So single-family recovery is, we're really looking at coming out with the great financial crisis. So also about 70% of starts versus what had typically been closer to 80%. So if we're seeing it move back to a more of a normalized portion of what we would expect single-family to be, particularly as we're looking at these deurbanization trends, that is we're looking at states in which we have a significant presence, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida. Those are going to be cities and those are going to be states that would be grown out, not states that will be growing up and places that are growing out tend to be more aggregates intensive. So yes, I think our builders are busy. Yes, I think they will have to buy more land. I think they will be in the entitlement business but I think in the areas where we are the entitlements, would not end up being significant, I'll have to use your word, I think it's a good one, a governor, on what housing growth is going to look like.
Stanley Elliott: Great. And then just switching gears, thinking about kind of the leverage range that you guys have talked about operating in the past, I mean you are kind of there right now. Barring any sort of thing on the CapEx side, it should be another good year of cash flow. How - are you more comfortable given the uncertain environment to kind of let the cash build? Is there some things on the M&A front that seem intriguing right now, just curious how you're thinking about the capital deployment into next year.
Howard Nye: Stanley, that's a great question and you're right, we're at the low end of our range. So our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at two times today. You've seen that steadily come down and I'm proud of the way that we pulled that down. As you know, our capital priorities have not changed. And our capital priorities are to find the right acquisition. We think there may be some opportunities in 2021 that we're certainly looking at, the deal pipeline has become more active here over the last few months and that does not surprise us. And equally, the other thing that we're waiting to watch and everybody else in this call is too, what happens in the election? And it will be odd. For example, if we do see a wider new streak go to the United States and we see a higher regulatory regime come in, as I indicated earlier, we have certainly seen that as something that they can serve as a bit of a catalyst for M&A activity as well. So I think we want to make sure that we keep ourselves in a very flexible spot. Obviously, it's in management's discretion whether we go in and turn back on the repurchases, we will certainly look at that and think through it carefully. You did see us - as Jim commented in his opening comments, we raised our dividend in September, so our September shareholders have already benefited from that. So I like where we sit from a balance sheet perspective, but equally Stanley, and I think this is important as we think about M&A, I like where we sit from a regulatory perspective as well. The areas the country where we would be most interested in growing particularly if we're looking to establish new footprints. We've got a lot of white space and we have a lot of regulatory ability, from a Hart-Scott-Rodino perspective. And I think our teams have proven that they are very good at one, identifying transactions, number two, going through the process of memorializing it and then upon closing, pulling the synergy side of it as well. So we're going to find good uses for that cash, whether it's investing in Martin Marietta, returning to shareholders or finding right deal, but you know how we rank those in order, Stanley.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: On non-residential construction, is there any way to quantify how much of the non-res volume split is between the heavy industrial piece versus the retail and office, just given the shift you've made more towards the heavy non-res side over the last several years?
Howard Nye: Absolutely, Stanley. Stanley, as you recall, historically, non-res would have been around 30% of our business and then over the last several quarters, you've seen it actually considerably more than that, it's closer to the mid-30s. And you'll recall historically, this was really when I give you this background. This is pre-TXI, this is pre river for the Rocky's, this is pre-Bluegrass. We would have said, it's almost a 50-50 break between light on one hand and heavy on the other. As we've done these large transactions, as we come out of the river, as we have focused our business increasingly on these large commerce corridors, we feel like it - now the heavy side of it is probably at least 60%. So it's probably moved that much just as we've done these transactions. And it's interesting to go back and revisit that number I gave just a few minutes ago, even talking about the fact that in the San Antonio area right now, we're bidding on seven Amazon warehouses data center projects at various stages of bidding. So the locations where we've been, whether it's on the I-25 corridor, whether it's on the I-35 corridor, whether it's on the l-85 corridor or the l-95 corridor has really helped move that. And if you think about those corridor, l-95 was significantly changed by Bluegrass. I-85 was significantly changed about what we did with the assets that we acquired in Atlanta. l-35 was significantly changed by what we did with TXI and I-25 was completely remade with what we did in the River for the River - I mean River for the Rocky swap. So the percentage shift is probably 60%, 40% today but again, non-res has moved to a bigger piece of the pie in large measure, because infrastructure has underperformed as we've gone through a series of re-authorizations that unlike next year, has not gone up in value over the last 15 years.
Garik Shmois: Okay, thanks for that. Also just wanted to follow up on the guidance that you provided for the year. I don't want to focus too much on 4Q because it's a seasonally slower part of the year, but just given that...
Howard Nye: Yes.
Garik Shmois: How you provided on the October growth, I mean what do you think is driving the increase? Is it project timing, catch up from maybe some of the weather headwinds that you saw in 3Q? And then maybe just more broadly, how to calibrate the different ends of the guidance ranges?
Howard Nye: Yes, I think several things probably. One, we don't have some things going on this year that we had going on last year. They were actually varying degrees of headwinds last year. So if you go back to it, part of what you'll see is, we did have some increased grading last year we're stripping employees, we did accelerate some maintenance at our Hunter Cement Plant. And our Granite Canyon quarry which sits in Southern Miami, which feeds that very vibrant Northern Colorado market was later coming on last year, then we would have hoped. And then Hurricane Dorian sided with Freeport Bahamas last year, a little bit longer that we would have wished though. Number one, they actually put some headwinds in Q4 last year and we're thinking we're probably past some of that this year, but equally, I think the October trends are nice. I think part of what we're seeing is some of the work, particularly in Central Texas as Tesla is building their bigger factory on the property that we sold them, that certainly add some benefits. And again, if we see something that feels like a normal winter cadence, we're very comfortable with what we feel like would be the midpoint of that range. So it - that at least gives you a sense of what the puts and takes would be in the little bit of the year that's left. I hope that's helpful.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phil Ng: If we think of some of the policy optionality go into next year. If we get a stimulus package this is separate from a longer-term authorization bill.
Howard Nye: Yes.
Phil Ng: Do you see that impact coming through a little quicker on the demand side where the lag is shorter because maybe states can dial-up lettings mid-year and see a benefit 2021? And then...
Howard Nye: Yes.
Phil Ng: …typically it's like a year plus lag. Okay, so you can…
Howard Nye: No, Yes, I think they can, because part of what's happened, Phil is, if we go back over time, several things. If you look at the way different states came out of the financial crisis, some states ended up hiring more people in DOTs, Texas is a good example. Some states started doing more outsourcing, North Carolina is a good example, which means at least as we're sitting here today, they have more projects that are engineered the designed, right-of-way has been purchased and they're in a position if they want to go that they can. And I think that's a very fundamentally different place. So to your point, if there is a pace for or if there is anything else and there is simply as you know, AASHTO has long been advocating for about $37 billion that they feel like should go roughly to states to help fill the hole that was created because yes, tax revenues weren't there. Now keep in mind, early in the year, they said that hole is going to be $50 billion, so that hole got a lot narrower or - not as deep over time. But to your point, if that money went directly to NCDOT, do they have plenty of uses for today? Absolutely. It's weather floating $400 million worth of bonds, could Texas do the same thing? To be sure, and could Colorado do the same thing? Absolutely, because again if you look at that state they are metering out there buying activity over time and that can simply come in and help augment that. So I do think your point's a good one, because most of what we've been discussing to date has been around the reauthorized bill and what the timing would look like on that. And again, we're saying passage in '21, but the real event from a tonnage is probably '22. But I do think if you've got some near-term stimulus that could actually be at '21 about.
Phil Ng: And then I think the margins in the quarter is certainly really impressive in light of the weaker volumes. But when we think out the 2021, assuming you have a little inflation not deflation like you've seen this year on energy, and you get some pricing and lower volumes. Do you have enough levers there to kind of drive unit economics higher or at least keep it flat and any color on the gross margin side as well.
Howard Nye: Yes, that, I - we'll obviously give you some really good guidance on that in February, but I think part of what we're trying to outline bill is, this is a really impressive quarter with volumes down almost double-digits and our most profitable business with its arm tied behind its back. So again, our backlogs, for example, in Texas look very good. So I think we can feel good about where that business is heading into '21. Obviously NCDOT is letting some jobs. I think we've been increasingly good about that. If the Eastern business gets some momentum going into '21 even in the back half, so that's where your story would be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Seldon Clarke: I guess just based on where October is trending right now and obviously, weather can be a prevention to this. But just based on where October is trending and how you're positioned from a non-resi perspective, and the improvement there you're talking to in regards to the outlook for state and federal funding. Is it fair then to say that 3Q will probably represent the steepest of the volume declines throughout this sort of downturn?
Howard Nye: Yes, that wouldn't surprise me. And again we'll come out with more granular information in February. But if we think about it, Seldon, this is the big quarter and keep in mind, this was a big quarter last year. So this was the beast of compares. And it's always interesting to look at how percentages can work in Q1, but I would suggest you percentages in Q1 helped me a lot because the tonnage is so slow. So it would not surprise me but this on a percentage down, unless we see things just changed dramatically. It would not surprise me that this would be your states single steepest client, to use your words.
Seldon Clarke: And then you gave some context around aggregates potentially going from 38% to 45% of the shipments with one of these highway bills. But I guess, just can you just help us understand sort of the relationship between a 28% or 45% increase in annual spending on coming from the government? And how that relates to your actual product demand, if we go back and look at some of these historical highlights...
Howard Nye: Yes. I guess...
Seldon Clarke: It was actually 28% growth. So how do you think about that?
Howard Nye: Yes. I guess the way we think of it, if we look at the states in which we see significant population trends and then that's going to be our top five states, where there will be capacity needs and capacity issue. So if you take that Georgia mobility program and think about that in more than just an Atlanta contracts and you think about the Atlanta, but you think also about Columbia, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida and Orlando and Raleigh and Charlotte, and then you start looking at 9 miles added. That's your single most aggregates intensive undertake because several things happen. So then it's taking a lot of tonnage, but it's taking a lot of vary tonnage as well. So you are you putting based products down, you are venture to put in clean stone and either asphalt or concrete and that's going down. So you're taking the entire way of more products. So number one, that's actually very healthy for inventories. Number two, it's actually very healthy for the way that we can run our business. Now can you take a crushing plant, hold it in some degree and produce less space and more clean stone so we - but I mean it's not a science and doing that because it's not that easy, but as a practical matter, if you've got a wider array of products going out that will intend to be the case, if you have a new highway bill and you've got capacity that is being added in states. What that does from an operating efficiency and what it does from an inventory efficiency is incredibly helpful. And part of that we've seen over the last several years is what would appear to be a fairly significant outperformance in non-residential. And what I would tell you is non-residential has actually been quite good but non-residential hasn't been really on fire. It's really that the public side of it has been slower than it should have been. So if we see more infrastructure go, it's high spec material, it's a material that we can deliver and we think of these states in which we're operating as they add needed capacity, it adds tonnage and it adds efficiency. I hope that helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
David MacGregor: So, I guess lot has been covered here in the past hour, so I'll just make a couple of quick ones. I guess in ready-mix, it seems like maybe there's just a price pass through issue, do we catch that up in the fourth quarter? Is this just a timing issue or is there something maybe more structural in the markets that's coming in the play here?
Howard Nye: No, I would say several things, one, we saw good price in Colorado and we saw some mix shifts in Texas. So I think that's largely what you see. And look, the other piece of it is, hey, the concrete business paid more for aggregates and the concrete business paid more for cement and that's okay from where we sit, because we're providing most of the aggregates and we're providing most of the cement and so that's a lot of what was going on there. But really, if you look at it, nice 2.2% per ton better on ASP. So a lot of good things that we're seeing in ready-mix right now, but in large measure, it helps undergo a very attractive upstream business, so it's doing exactly what we would have thought.
David MacGregor: Right, right. Second question is really just on Houston and in aggregates, you talked about the lower rail tons going into Houston. Is that a function just what's happening in energy or are you seeing congestion or any reduced level of service in rail?
Howard Nye: Well, service and rail has been reasonably good and it's really not so much Houston, it's really more South Texas when you get down to the pure LNG projects that are - or even closer to the water. And that was really a piece of the mix issues in the Southwest, because if we had fewer tons coming out of those yards, as you know those tons are transportation loaded, David, so that was really the big shift there. So it wasn't as much of our Houston metro per se issue because there is some very good projects going on in Houston, including the Grand Parkway. And for example, we've seen a good amount of cement go to that and as you may recall that, actually cement is modestly lower priced in San Antonio than it is in Dallas and things are going to the Grand Parkway are really coming out of Hunter facility. So we're not seeing bad activity in Houston, whatsoever, it was really more cost to oriented on that commentary.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Michael Dudas: Ward, we appreciate the insight on your - some of your tops important states, but maybe you can highlight quiet a couple in the - on the second side or others where you've seen some either positive or negative trends that might be helpful to help out a little bit more on say that the volume expectations is some of these macro events impact second quarter '21 and '22.
Howard Nye: Look, I'll certainly time and if we're looking at South Carolina, they're going to FY 2021 program would buy $1.8 billion, that's up about 15%, so we like what we're seeing there. The South Carolina did something the other year that was very on South Carolina of them and that is they raise the gas tax. So they are taking that up incrementally over a period of six years. We're about halfway through that, so we're seeing good activity there. All of that, we're really Arkansas passed a 10-year $10 billion funding plan so that basically doubles their funding over $8 billion over a 10-year plan and we like where we see that business going. Keeping in mind, we've got a very attractive business in and around Arkansas City and we're seeing good activity at the airport there as well. Our business in Indiana, just to be clear, we call it our Indiana district that we have historically, it's really our Indianapolis district and what we've seen in that business and the leadership there has just done a superb job of controlling costs exceptionally well. I mean they really do deserve a call out on that, but they equally done very well and making sure we're getting good recognition on pricing on what we're doing in that marketplace. I think Indiana is looking quite strong. If I'm looking questions just to be completely open book with you on where we've seen more difficulty this year, it's been in places like Kentucky and portions of Savina Hill. Kentucky DOT has not had its finest moment this year and I think equally you've heard that from others is they have gone through, I think you would have heard a bit of that from Summit and its commentary earlier in the week as well. But if we're looking at places like Maryland, and we're looking at Virginia, and Iowa, in Nebraska, and as going through those, just give you a sense of it, Michael, that does round out our top 10 states which is going to be 85% of our revenue. They're not things that we feel like are troubling to us as we looked at Maryland, Virginia, Iowa, or Nebraska right now, again, Maryland has a very significant T3 program, and the other states just tend to be very solid states. Remember, Iowa consume on average more stone per capita than any place else because they go through a hard place sale cycle each year and it's a big farm to market economy, but equally that's been an economy that has been served quite well by what's happening relative to data warehousing. So we've seen Microsoft and Amazon and others, not just build warehousing but Phases 2 or Phases 3 and sometimes Phases 4 of that, so that's actually been quite good. The one area in the Midwest that has been more challenging this year has been plus not happened relative to wind energy and we call that out on some of the commentary that we had just breaking down between business in our East Group and business in our West Group, but hopefully that was responsive to taking a little bit deeper dive in the bottom five.
Michael Dudas: We're certainly was and I wasn't treating about the factoring on Iowa I was not aware of. Thank you.
Howard Nye: That's would what we give for. Take care, Michael.
Michael Dudas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Can I ask a quick question, and then I'll turn it over. But I wanted to ask on ready-mix, if you could comment on the backlogs in ready-mix and also the outlook for pricing forth?
Howard Nye: No, no, happy to. I mean, it's interesting, but are different pricing is always a little bit challenging at least in half, outlook and pricing in Colorado tends to be very attractive pricing, outlook on pricing in Texas continues to look pretty steady. I would tell you is we look at backlogs year-over-year, there are 3% and if you're looking at a very dynamic market I like the way that works. So, again part of what we've done in Texas in particular item is, we've moved a certain degree of our volume in Texas from infrastructure, in some instances to housing and I will tell you very candidly, why we did it, we wanted to have it and a little bit more of that in housing, one, because housing look good; and two, housing does not tend to be as weather-sensitive it's infrastructure as. Now that said, housing tends to have a little bit lower ASPs. So we're picking and choosing very much by design there, but again we think pricing will be solid and we think backlogs in that business right now are actually up in the Southwest.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Adrian Huerta: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just to ask on, you have mentioned in the past there was room on recent acquisitions to increase prices, how far are you on that, is there still room to increase prices from recent acquisitions?
Howard Nye: Adrian, it's always a journey, it's like safety, we never think we're done. And what I would say if we go back and look at the way things have worked. One of the best examples I can give you is Maryland and we were talking about just a moment ago with Michael, what some of the states look like that were not in our top five and I spoke, specifically the Maryland. And then what's interesting to me on that, Adrian, is Maryland for us in the Bluegrass transaction was not necessarily a consolidation play. We had a couple of facilities in that state there in the western part of the state, and most of what we acquired Bluegrass there was in Maryland, who was really more in Baltimore metro. And what we brought to that is a discipline and we brought to it a sense of not being ashamed to make sure we are getting the right value for a product that we're making that needs, state and federal specifications, and that we think it's not easy to do. And keeping in mind that, on the infrastructure side, stone is about 10% of the cost of building road, on the housing side, it's about 2% of the cost of a home and if we look at non-residential at somewhere between those two numbers. In other words, our product is never going to be, but it's going to make or break whether the project goes or not. Equally, our product isn't going to make or break whether that contractors typically low or not, but at the same time to do what we do with the scale that we do and do it as safely as we do. We want to make sure we're getting good value for something that's a depleting resource. Now that said, if we look on average at today's rates of taking start on the ground, we've got a century with reserves left. So we don't have an issue of the stone going away, but in a world that we think will continue to have higher regulatory barriers and burdens to entry, making sure we're getting value for this product is important. I will tell you, equally, you can see what our average selling prices and it's going to be in the low teens, right now, but there are plenty of markets in the United States where we're selling aggregates for numbers that have a two in front of it and we don't see those higher numbers having any degree of chilling effect on construction in those markets. So this has been an area for our company that has been one of strength for a long time. Back to my point, this continues to be a journey. I think it's going to be an area of strength for years yet to come, Adrian.
Howard Nye: Thank you all for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, safety and operational performance and remain focused on maximizing value for all shareholders. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company’s website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta’s, Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder today’s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today’s earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on second quarter operating performance as well as current and emerging market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and liquidity position, and Ward will then provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today’s teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are remaining safe and healthy as we continue to manage through these unprecedented times. As highlighted in this earnings released Martin Marietta delivered outstanding operational financial and safety performance, not withstanding some localized weather headwinds in the quarter and the broader uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance is a testament to our company’s commitment to our values, the world-class attributes of our business and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Martin Marietta established few profitability records for both the second quarter and the first half of the year driven by favorable pricing and proactive cost management across the building materials business, for the second quarter specifically consolidated gross margin expanded 200 basis points despite slightly lower revenues as compared with the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to 5.6%. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $407 million and fully diluted earnings per share was $3.49, a 16% improvement. An addition to record financial performance and despite the challenging conditions, we also achieved the best safety performance in our history, companywide both our lost time and total entry, instant rates are better than world class safety levels. These superior results are directly attributable to our dedicated and talented employees who have continued to demonstrate resiliency during these uncertain times. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team has adapted to our new health protocols, while remaining steadfastly focused on caring for one another safely and efficiently and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders needs. Martin Marietta along with many of our customers has operated as a designated essential business during the COVID-19 shutdowns and subsequent phases which did experienced impact from a macro economic slowdown. Despite these challenges, second quarter product demand for building materials business remains strong across a number of our key geographies, including North Texas and the Front Range of Colorado, two of our leading vertically integrated markets. Contractors continued construction on projects already underway and have in some instances benefited from jobs that were accelerated to better leverage lower traffic volumes during shelter in place orders and new projects. In addition, we saw aggregate shipments growth in Georgia and Florida, despite above average rainfall in these states during the quarter and in Indiana. Overall quarterly aggregate shipments declined approximately 4% compared within the record prior your period volume. As reminder, our second quarter 2019 results benefited from blended deferred carryover work, sizeable energy sector projects and Midwest flooding repair activity. Aggregates pricing improved 3.3%. All divisions contributed to this growth underscoring the health of our markets and the importance of our locally driven pricing strategy. By region, the West group posted a 5.5% increase, reflecting favorable product mix. Pricing for the Mid-America Group improved 2% essential division, which is selling prices below the corporate average contributed a higher percentage of the Mid-America Group shipments consistent with the first quarter trends. Product mix limited Southeast Group pricing growth as a higher percentage of lower priced files and base stone were shipped.  Underlying demand for our Texas base cement business remains largely stable. However, second quarter cement shipments decreased 3% driven primarily by the decline in energy sector activity that has resulted from lower oil prices. West Texas oil wells cement shipments were down over 75% from pre-COVID expectations, a trend expected to continue until oil prices stabilize at a level that fosters additional investment in drilling activity in the Permian Basin. Throughout the quarter, we saw attractive and consistent pricing strength in our North and Central Texas cement operations. Specifically, cement prices in Dallas and San Antonio, the markets most proximate to our Midlothian and Hunter facilities were up 4%. That said notably lower shipments of higher priced oil wells specialty cement products down for West Texas limited overall price and growth. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, the readymix concrete shipments increased nearly 9% excluding prior year shipments from our southwest readymix divisions Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas business known generally as ArkLaTex, which we divested earlier this year. Overall, concrete pricing increased modestly, but was hindered by unfavorable product mix. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business establish a new quarterly record for asphalt shipments. Shipments increased 35% to 1.1 million tons, benefiting from market strength and pent up demand following a weather challenge 2019. Asphalt pricing declined 1% as customer segmentation was weighted more heavily toward publicly bid municipal projects, as opposed to negotiated private work. The company’s Magnesia Specialties business experienced most pronounced COVID-19 headwinds during the second quarter, domestic and international chemicals demand declined as customers confronted COVID-19 related disruptions. Demand for a lime and periclase products also slowed significantly as steel producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19 induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers. Before discussing near-term and emerging trends. I will now turn the call over to Jim for review of our second quarter financial results and liquidity. Jim.
James Nickolas: Thank you, Howard and good morning to everyone. It is worth highlighting that the enterprise achieved a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. This is the highest EBITDA margin in the company’s history. The driving force behind this accomplishment was the building materials, which achieved record second quarter products and service revenues of $1.1 billion, a 1% increase from the prior year quarter and gross profit of $359 million a 9% increase. Notably, all of our building materials product lines contributed to this record profitability. Solid pricing gains, production efficiencies and lower diesel fuel costs drove a 230 basis point improvement in aggregate product gross margin to 35.5% also an all time record. This was accomplished despite lower volumes, demonstrating the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregate led business. Our Texas cement operations benefited from improved kiln reliability, as well as lower raw material and fuel costs. Product gross margin of 39.7% expanded 210 basis points despite a nearly 3% decline in cement revenues. As we have mentioned, our targeted downstream businesses delivered outstanding operational performance during the quarter. Readymix concrete product gross margin improved 270 basis points to 10.6% driven by increased shipments, pricing improvements and lower delivery costs. Equally impressive, our Colorado asphalt and paving business established second quarter records both revenues and gross profit. Product revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business decreased 31% to $49 million, reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. Lower revenues resulted in a 420 basis point reduction of product gross margin to 37.3% or we expect this business will face similar headwinds in the third quarter. A gross margin in the high-30s is in practice, and indicative of superb cost management. Consolidated SG&A expenses included $3 million for COVID-19 related expenses, which included enhancements to cleaning and safety protocols across our over 400 sites. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our long standing disciplined, capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and consistently return of capital to shareholders, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. Furthermore, capital expenditures are now expected in a range of $350 million to $375 million. A slight upward revision from the guidance provided last quarter, as U.S. businesses were in the early stages of responding to the pandemic. Our current priorities projects are expected to improve efficiencies, capacity and safety, all core principles in the foundation of a strong financial performance. While we typically invest in the business. We also look for appropriate opportunities to divest non-operating assets to maximize value. In this regard, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to sell 82 [indiscernible] location in Austin, Texas for nearly $100 million. Since our repurchase authorization was announced in February, 2015, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of shared purchases and meaningful sustainment dividends. Share repurchases activity remains temporarily paused during the quarter. However, the purchases can resume at management’s discretion. In May we repaid $300 million of floating rate notes that matured using proceeds for our first quarter bond issuance. The company has no additional bond maturity until July, 2024. We are confident in our balance sheet strengths, we have ample liquidity and financial flexibility to continue possibly growing our business. Net cash combined the nearly $970 million available on our existing developments facilities provided total liquidity of $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Additionally, at a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times we renamed well within our target leverage range as of the end of the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard for his market trends commentary.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim, with the successful completion of an outstanding first half of 2020, we remain laser focused on managing our business through the macroeconomic upheaval from COVID-19 and related governmental responses. While in July product demand and pricing trends across our markets remain broadly consistent with second quarter, we feel it is premature to reinstate full-year 2020 earnings guidance given the uncertainty regarding the pandemic, potential phrase for stimulus and infrastructure reauthorization. Nonetheless, we remain highly confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business guided by our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. We expect pricing resiliency and disciplined cost management to continue supporting the company’s near-term performance. As the economy resets from COVID-19, we believe favorable pricing trends for our products will continue supported by disciplined locally driven pricing strategy and attractive geographic footprint. For aggregates specifically, we anticipate full-year 2020 pricing will increase 3% to 4% from the prior year. This range is slightly below our pre COVID-19 expectations given year-over-year geographic and product mix trends and slightly delayed price increases in certain markets. Texas cement pricing is also expected to remain resilient due to the state’s tight supply demand dynamics. And the fact that our team markets are by design largely insulated from waterborne imports. Healthy aggregates in cement pricing trends should benefit our targeted downstream operations. Existing customer backlogs support the company’s shipment levels in the near-term and certain regions where we operate, this year’s weather has been more disruptive of construction activity and project cadence, than the pandemic. Yet we believe the industry will likely see a gradual, but not precipitous temporary slowing in product demand over the next few quarters as businesses and governments address budget shortfalls resulting from COVID-19. That said, the degrees or decline and recovery will vary by end use market and geography and will be influenced by future governmental actions. Infrastructure, construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets is expected to be the most near-term resilient as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded. However, State Departments of Transportation or DOTs may decrease the scale or postpone the timing of future construction is very balanced lower revenue collections and other short-term funding needs relating to the COVID-19 impact, particularly if there is no near-term federal assistance. These impacts will vary by state. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021, which begins September 1st are currently planned at $7 billion comparable to fiscal year 2020. Earlier this month, Texas DOT also reiterated its $77 billion 10-year unified transportation plan. To ease funding shortfalls to its DOT budget, Colorado will issue certificates of participation to advance plan projects, the majority of which are concentrated along the mega region following the I-25 corridor, which has been the strategic focus of our Rocky Mountain business. Of our Top 10 states, Carolina DOT faces the toughest near-term funding challenges. As a reminder, NCDOT temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues, and other factors. Since then, new contract advertisements have been further delayed. For the near-term NCDOT will benefit from $700 million in build NC bond revenues to fund existing transportation programs. Longer term, we anticipate transportations ballot initiatives, as well as new revenue enhancing recommendations from the NC first commission, which is tasked with evaluating North Carolina’s growing transportation investment needs and ensuring that critical financial resources are available. Despite some near-term DOT headlines, the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal infrastructure package will provide multiyear upside, while it is unlikely a successor bill will be agreed upon and signed into law prior to Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act expiration on September 30th, we feel confidence new legislation will be enacted and provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15-years. When this occurs, it will be a big win for our industry and for Martin Marietta. For non-residential construction activity on existing projects has continued, some commercial and institutional projects in the design or planning stages are being delayed or cancelled. The Dodge Momentum Index or DMI, a monthly measure of a first report for non-residential building projects and planning, which has historically led construction spending for non-residential building by a full-year is down 20% from its most recent peak in July of 2018. However to contextualize the June reading the Great Recession peak to trough DMI decline was 62%. And prudently since the Great Recession, Martin Marietta has purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure to be more heavy industrial focus, as we have expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Aggregates intensive warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to lead non-residential activity as businesses increase capacity for ecommerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services. Further large liquefied natural gas or LNG projects along the Texas Gulf Coast that are actively underway have broadly continued. However, start dates for the next wave of projects have been postponed. Longer term, we believe non-residential construction activity could benefit from more companies streamlining their supply chains and repatriating manufacturing operations back to the United States providing potential multiyear upside to heavy industrial construction. Residential construction is rebounding more quickly than anticipated by homebuilders and third-party forecasters. After decline in April, the National Association of homebuilders housing market index are widely recognized survey designed to measure sentiment for the U.S. single family housing market return to pre-pandemic levels in July, signaling that residential growth may lead to an overall economic recovery. Consistent with recent homebuilder commentary activity has strengthened as Martin Marietta states have reopened, demonstrating pent up housing demand following the COVID-19 related pause in the spring selling season. Nationally housing starts remain below the 50-year annual average of 1.5 million despite notable population gains. Freddie Mac estimates that 2.5 million housing units are needed to address the current nationwide housing shortage. This situation is particularly evident in states with significant under supply, including Texas, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, which are all in our top 10 states. These trends, along with historically low mortgage rates bode well for future expansion in single family housing activity, which is two to three times more aggregates intensive and multi-family housing given the typical ancillary non-residential and infrastructure construction activity. Also longer term, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit across all three of our primary end uses from accelerated to organization trends, as for homebuilders and the shift to remote work encourage more prospective homebuyers to move to smaller metro or suburban locations. Our leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint provides us a distinct competitive advantage in regions with diverse employment opportunities, land availability, favorable climate and a lower cost of living. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta’s opportunities to build on our successful track record of financial and operational outperformance. SOAR 2025, our strategic plan for the next five years will be finalized this year, and provides the framework to support our capital performance, price discipline, cost management, sustainable practices, talent development, and succession planning initiatives. We have already made great strides on these endeavors. Earlier this month, we streamlined our business structure into five operating divisions East, Central and Southwest, West, and Magnesia Specialties. This new structure better aligns our business product offerings and geographies, provides experienced executives with increased responsibilities and opportunities, strengthens our ability to provide outstanding customer service and further enhances our industry leading cost profile. In closing, we are all living in unprecedented and dynamic times. And that will likely persists as the pandemic continues unabated. Moving forward and our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and world-class teams position Martin Marietta to responsibly navigate today’s challenging environment and to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. Overall, we continue to feel confident about the future and our plan to continue building on Martin Marietta’s long track record of success and delivering sustainable, value creation and superior returns for investors. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: Hey good morning everyone.
Howard Nye: Good morning Trey.
Trey Grooms: Okay. So I guess first I want to focus on margins. I guess demand is going to be what it is going to be. But in the materials business, you know gross profit improvement across the board and that is even with down revenue in most segments and Jim touched on some of the benefits there, but can you talk about kind of the puts and takes there and we understand, diesel was your friends in the quarter, but you know, even outside of diesel where maybe you had some good guys that we could see continue going forward?
Howard Nye: Trey thanks for the question. You are right diesel was the friends, but we managed our labor. We managed SG&A, we managed our efficiencies and other things that we believe have the capacity to endure actually quite well during the quarter. Trey what we are endeavoring to do and I think what you have seen in the quarter is we are building a business that has the ability and should be expected to outperform as we go through cycles. So to your point volume is going to be, where the volume is going to be, and volume was down 4% for the quarter, but we saw profitability going nicely up, but pricing is a big piece of that and that has been something that Martin Marietta has demonstrated, I think extraordinary skill around managing. We have a depleting resource. We want to make sure we are getting good value for it. We are also going to flex very carefully on the labor side and the other thing that I think you are seeing evidence of is we have been very thoughtful in the way that we deploy capital. So I think if we look at the CapEx has done relative to our ability to continue to gain efficiencies that has been an important piece of it. One thing that I would call out to you in particular and really the comments I just gave you went specifically to the aggregates business. But I think two, if we look at our cement business, that also saw down volumes for the quarter, we are seeing much better reliability numbers relative to our mid loading operation and hunter facilities as well. So what we are seeing across our footprint is profitability, improved efficiencies, improved costs in a number of dimensions, but we are also getting the price stray and that is something that matters.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Okay. That is helpful and encouraging, especially in the face of the volume that you are facing. And as to the follow-up you mentioned that you could see additional demand slowing in the next couple of quarters or in the coming quarters. But if you could dive into that a bit more because, you were looking for something similar or had some similar comments during the last earnings call. So that doesn't seem like a new outlook necessarily but things have held in better, you know than expected. And it sounds like July trends are still largely the same as the second quarter. So just trying to understand, you know, maybe high level timing and I'm understanding you are not giving exact guidance, but if you look over your three primary businesses infrastructure non-res and res, how you rank your outlook for those and where you see some potential or for relative strength or weakness.
Howard Nye: Sure Trey, happy to try to do that. And I'm with you. I mean, I don't think what we are saying today relative to outlook should be a surprise to anyone. I think it is actually a very consistent conversation we have been having. And if we look at it, volume is down 4% in aggregate for the quarter profits were up. So I think that gives you a sense of it. Here is how I would break down the end users as you think of it. Look infrastructure for the quarter was actually pretty steady. I think one of the questions is what will phase four stimulus look like because it is been well documented with gas taxes going down state clearly have had some degree of revenue challenges with respect to that particular dimension. It is fascinating to me to see where AASHTO is today, AASHTO to making an ask that there would be about $37 billion in the phase four stimulus that would go directly to state DOTs. If that happens, I have to tell you state DOTs are going to probably be in a pretty good place. What I have tried to do with the prepared remarks too to give you a sense of where are our top three state DOTs, even irrespective of that may come from some form of COVID stimulus. And I think what you have heard is Texas DOTs in a pretty good place, Colorado DOT is going to use certificates of participation to help themselves out. And NCDOT despite having more challenges and those other two, I will tell you DOT we feel a lot better about today than we did when we were talking to in the first quarter. But there is now FY 2021 bedding are estimated there to 1.3 million that is really similar to 2016 level and well above that we have seen before is about a $600 million estimate. So, I think DOT and infrastructure is going to be relatively steady. I think a lot hinges on that phase will look like. I think res is going to be up, I think res could be up relatively nicely in a number of markets. And I think the footprint that we have is going to help that pretty considerably. I think you are clearly going to see more single family housing activity than we have seen for a while. And here is an interesting Trey that is worth noting. Potential single family housing activities we look at it at least prospectively. During the run from 1990 to 2009, single family building comprised about 80% of what we are seeing in the housing market. Over the last several years, the last 10-years, it has been modestly less than 70% of that. So again, if we see single family housing moving in a more normalized fashion and we think we will - we think that is going to be a pretty attractive price. Non-res is likely to be the area in which you are going to see a bit more near-term softness and portions of it, and probably strength in others. So as we think about non-res, what I would suggest is as follows. Heavy non-res is likely to perform relatively well. What do I mean by that? What are we seeing more warehousing in data centers in the works? The answer is yes, I mean, are we seeing more work with Facebook in places like [indiscernible], yes. Are we seeing more work with Google? Yes, but are we seen more work with Amazon and others? Yes, we are. Do I think hospitality and retail shops may feel a little more near-term pressure? I think they probably will. But part of what you heard me say in the prepared commentary as well, is we have been very careful to build our business in ways that we feel like major commerce corridors will continue to grow in an outsized way. So I think we are positioned well for there. The other thing that I will say is the smallest piece of our business can rock and rail and actually had a pretty attractive quarter. And we started balance volume actually up and we are not surprised by that. We saw that principally in the Western United States. And we see that is something that is likely to be relatively stable to flat going forward. So again, Trey I will try to hit all four of those end users, but of course, infrastructure and non-res and res are the three big ones.
Trey Grooms: Okay. That all makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions Howard very helpful. I will pass it on.
Howard Nye: You bet. Take care Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi thank you for taking my questions today. Just following on, on the infrastructure piece and appreciate the color that you had in your prepared commentary. Looking at Phase 4 stimulus and the lending highway reauthorization. But if you could for listeners really filter the noise in terms of what T&I committee in the house presented versus EPW and the senate and what that could mean, and really kind of a scenario analysis of what really happens to infrastructure volumes, if something happened and if something doesn't happen?
Howard Nye: Kathryn thanks for the questions. So really, we are going to look at that in two different buckets. Well if you think about what reauthorization looks like. As a sudden prepared comments, we don't think that happens before September 30th. So we think they will probably use your longer term CR. That is nothing to be alarmed by the way. I don't think they are going to issue a longer term continuing resolutions, because they think it is going to last for a long time. I think they may put in place optically what would be a longer term continuing resolutions simply to continue giving states the confidence to keep running projects. I don't think, it means they slow down on coming up with reauthorized bill. So to your point there are two different starting points, Kathryn. Last July vicinity PW came out with unanimity around the $287 billion plan. And that is basically a very nice percentage increase of where we were relative to the FAST Act. Now to give you more recent issues, house C&I released their plan, that was $319 billion, that was a 41% increase over the FAST Act. In the near-term, this is at least worth considering. And that is the House Appropriations Subcommittee on transportation, housing and urban development. Passed legislation that would provide about $107 billion in resources for U.S. DOT for FY 2021 including almost $62 billion for the highway programs, that is up 33%. So one of the questions I think is a fair one is what does a CR look like? And so I think normally you are looking at a CR, that is probably flat for some period of time, as they work toward, but I think evidently will likely be an increased multiyear highway bill. So Kathryn to your point. Worst case, you have a CR is flat. Best case, you have a CR that actually has some growth to it. I think expected case issue get a bill next year that is a nice increase several credit for the FAST Act does. And I equally think the conversations that have been had recently, relative to Phase 4 stimulus have not as to fear like the likelihood of seeing some very direct assistance. Going to state DOTs is actually better than we would have thought properly, when we were having this conversation three months ago. And again, the AASHTO asked there is around $30 billion. So I have tried to outline what I think the subs are, and I have tried to handicap where I think they sit.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay that is helpful. And then shifting gears to the pricing commentary and we went through a few puts and takes in terms of what patted pricing for the quarter. But when you look at the bigger secular trends that are going to be coming up importantly on the residential housing. What and how should we think about pricing from a geographic and a mix standpoint, if there ends up being a bigger mix of residential versus non-res in market exposure?
Howard Nye: You know, I don't think end use is going to be a big driver and what we see relative to price increases. It is fascinating , for example, if you have got a single a home builder and they're coming through, they're probably buying stone at this price, which is frankly a pretty high price as things go generally. But I would think if you are seeing just standard growth along those different end users, and you are seeing in Southeast and Southwest, and clearly you have got higher ASPs in the Southeast right now from doing southwest you might have some geographic mix issues if you come from that. But from a margin perspective or from a pricing increase perspective, I wouldn't expect to see anything that would be particularly notable in any of that. I think the primary thing that you are going to continue to see is good, steady price increases, because I think that is something that would just recognize the value of, and we have locations that put us in a position that we can get the value that we need for our shareholders.
Kathryn Thompson: Alright. Thank you for taking my questions today.
Howard Nye: Thank you Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning. Just following up on pricing or do you discuss 2020 ags pricing up 34%, which has maybe slightly below your pre-COVID expectations and can you talk about mix just now, but you also talked looking slightly delayed price increases in certain markets. And just wondering if those were purely a function of slack demand or maybe some increased competitive intensity or if there is any kind of other color you can get there.
Howard Nye: Yes, I guess I would say several things. The primary driver so far has really been product mix and geographic mix. Just be clear on that. And when we are talking about delays, we are not talking about delays that were more than in the 45-day or 60-day range. And typically the delay and the number you had it late, you didn't have to lay in the number. And it happened really quite sporadically. I want to say it happened in probably two or three different sub markets. So I didn't view it as anything that made me feel remarkably different about the way the pricing situation works. The primary people who I would say pushed to at least see some deferment. If you recall in the earliest, earliest stages of COVID homebuilders in some instances were just walking away from subdivisions and taking about a 60-day to 90-day time out. I think in some of those instances, they were really afraid and looking for some immediate help. And I think some competitors and some instances did that. I think in some instances too, you had some readymix concrete producers who were looking for some lower inputs. Frankly we were not inclined to meet those. And we probably brought some modest share in some places, we have certainly done that before in cement. But again, we very have a value over volume philosophy that we bring to this. So from our perspective, Anthony, the delays were immaterial, but at the same time we try to be resilient through this.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That is very helpful. And you talked about kind of gradual, but not precipitous decline in second half demand. And I'm wondering if you could distinguish just directionally between ags, cement, readymix and asphalt in terms of you know where second half volumes might hold up a little bit better, or maybe see some incremental puncture just based on what you saw in 2Q and end of July.
Howard Nye: No. I think in many respect, if you looked at the commentary that I gave on geography in the prepared remarks that is probably a pretty fair way to think of it in the second half as well. What is interesting to me Anthony is we put up a record first half and a record second quarter. And actually one of the areas that had a tougher quarter was actually our mid Atlantic division and our mid Atlantic division has both higher average selling prices and higher profitability. So it tells me that the balance of the business is actually performing extraordinarily well. We see good business right now in Texas. We see good business in Colorado, we see business in portions of the central United States. We are seeing, I think, good solid business in Florida. And we think all of those will persist for the balance of the year. We are actually seeing very good businesses in cement in Texas right now, as well. The first stage obviously really we are more geared toward aggregates. Obviously, the only hot mix business we have is in Colorado it is a very, very good first half we think it is going to have a good second half as well. And then Magnesia Specialties, it is fascinating when we say that businesses is hitting an air pocket right now, I think that is what it is. We think steel found bottom actually in June. We think it is going to slowly get better. We are not seeing a huge bounce back in Magnesia Specialties in the second half of the year, but even in a challenge, first half, it had margins of 37%. So I think that gives you a pretty good snapshot of ags, cement, the downstream business and the Magnesia Specialties as well.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay. That is very helpful. I will turn it over.
Howard Nye: Thank you Anthony.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Well, really nice quarter. And, I'm just wondering, can you just expand on the discussion of what went right this quarter, normal seasonality would have you had about 27% gross margins. And you folks did about 10% better than that. And I appreciate the comments about operating efficiency. Can you just expand on those because volumes were obviously weaker than normal seasonality, but margins stronger is just really notable. And I'm just wondering, can you just provide a little bit more context on the drivers of the sequential improvement? And I realized you breached a year-over-year, but this question really stands out to me.
Howard Nye: Now, I'm happy to try to do that. Look obviously, energy was a piece of that. It wasn't everything, but it was a nice piece of it. I think controlling labor was a piece of it. I still think you can do that with greater efficiencies in some place. I do think overall efficiencies by the way and we are a piece on it. And we talked about the fact that we are seeing much higher efficiencies in our cement business, all that stuff we have seen nice improvement. Over time it goes Midlothian and Hunter so that that is certainly going to help. The other thing that I will say Jerry and I mentioned that in the prepared comments and it is in our released today as well. This was an extraordinary safe quarter. And I think safety and you have heard us speak to that as a core value of this business, drives increased efficiencies and simply makes your business better and makes your people better. And from we are sitting here and happier with total injury incident rates and loss time incident rates, both exceeding world class standards. I think that really speaks to how teams are operating. The other thing that I will say relative to efficiencies is we have been very careful with how we have looked at capital allocation and CapEx over the last several years. And I think we are starting to see some of the efficiencies from that as well, which is one of the reasons that we are not at all shy, for example, to take the midpoint of the guidance that we have given relative CapEx this year. And as I think you saw, we have taken that up by about $25 million. So Jerry I wish I could point to one thing and say, this is it, I think it is a series of things. And I think when we go back to the notion that our aim is to continue to build an increasingly better business, they can go through cycles and outperform in any of those. I think that is what we are seeing.
Jerry Revich: And then in terms of asphalt pricing, paving pricing concrete. Can you just talk about your competitive position in your key markets and whether with the volume drawdown that you are looking for over the next couple of quarters. What is your degree of confidence in being able to hold line on pricing in those downstream businesses? Obviously, we know, what you are going to do in aggregate, but can you comment on the downstream market please?
Howard Nye: Sure I can and If we think about asphalt and paving Jerry, the nice thing from our perspective is the only question we have that businesses in Colorado. And last year as you will recall Jerry, they had a very weather impacted here. So they came into the year with very attractive backlogs. But again, we are seeing very good efficiencies. The asphalt and to paving we have is really running from Northern Colorado through Denver, down to Southern Colorado. We have actually seen bidding opportunities accelerated in an outpacing here in June, after a slow first half relative to bidding activity. What is odd, in many respects, is if we are looking out farther. I think generally, we feel better about the business today, for example, than we did even after Q1. So if we are looking at asphalt pricing liquid itself is about $420, that is down about 5% per ton. We think liquids going to remain in that range. We think our bidding opportunities are going to stay attractive. We think we have got a very good business in Colorado. And of course, one of the tricky things in Colorado is making sure that you are in a position to get good quality specifications stone, and we are in a position to start supplying with that. So we feel good about that asphalt and paving business and of course it had a very attractive first half. With respect to readymix concrete they had good first half too, I mean the downstream businesses performed really quite well, if you are looking like-for-like volumes. readymix was 8.7% keeping in mind that is really pulling that ArkLaTex business out. If you are trying to look at it geographically, in Colorado, where we have readymix, those volumes are up a little bit more than 14%. If we are looking in Texas, which is the other place that we have had that particular business, they were up around 6.2%. And again, part of what we are seeing is much better efficiencies in that business, delivery, costs and efficiencies are better. And again, these are not big surprises to us and we think many of these to your point are sustainable as well Jerry.
Jerry Revich: And Howard in concrete do you think you can hold the line on price with the volume outlook that you laid up?
Howard Nye: You know part of that, I think is something on that is aggregates and cement in those markets. Aggregates in cement in Texas, and aggregates in Colorado, which obviously we saw supply are going up. And when you are see the input costs, at least in my experience, in readymix going up, those tend to be very helpful actually to the downstream businesses, and we are very mindful of that.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane BNP Paribas.
Paul Roger: Hi there, good afternoon form London guys. Nice quarter.
Howard Nye: Thank you Paul.
Paul Roger: Yes. Just moving Howard on to maybe away from the trade and the outlook, may be on to capital allocation obviously Jim mention the priorities which you talked about before. But you clearly do have a strong balance sheet and when do you think you could start to deploy some of that again. Are you resuming a buyback or maybe by doing some distress M&A and what is the deals pipeline looking like right now.
Howard Nye: Paul thanks for the question. That is a good one, because if you look at our capital allocation priorities, we have long said the right deal is our number one priority. And I will say several things. One, I think our teams do an extraordinary job on transaction identification. I think they also do an extraordinary job on going through the transaction and looking at where we can get synergies. In our operating teams if you go back and look at whether it is [CXI] (Ph) or bluegrass, or the transactions in Colorado or otherwise have outperformed relative to synergies, that is a long way of saying that we remain very focused on growing our business. When we look at growing their business, we are focused on two things in particular, what is the geography and what are the end uses? It is an aggregate sled business but we are keenly focused on player, because the player really dictates how a business is going to perform. And a good example of that is we have had very good performance in Texas. You also saw very good performance in Colorado, but equally we are having great performance in the central which is just down, so we are seeing great performance all the way across. Relative to share buy backs and otherwise, I think the primary thing that we are waiting for right now, Paul is just some modest visibility forward on what is going to happen, particularly with respect to some of these government elections. I think we will have much better sense very soon. First going to have on Phase 4, I think what happens with Phase 4, it is going to give us a much better sense of how the infrastructure piece is going to look. So I think we are just a couple of pieces of information away from being able to really buybacks and otherwise. But please remember our primary aim is the right transaction going forward. Number two, assuring that we are investing in the business in a responsible way and you have actually seen us take CapEx midpoint up $25 million and then returning cash to shareholders through two different ways, a meaningful and sustainable dividend and our Board will obviously look at our dividend in August. So there will be here next month and they will look at that and then relative to share buy backs. I think we have touched base on that Paul.
Paul Roger: The terms of the deal pipeline Howard, I mean are you seeing some distressed opportunities come on the radar or are they quiet coming in?
Howard Nye: There are not a lot of distress opportunities per say out there, because particularly in the aggregates business, they tend to have pretty healthy balance sheets today. The family businesses are in pretty good shape. Our view has long been that succession tends to be a bigger driver of potential transactions in aggregates than been not. So I don't want to give you a sense that there are people who are in trouble and they are knocking down our doors right now that would not be accurate, but there are plenty of ordinary, typical and sensible transactions that we are looking at by now Paul.
Paul Roger: That is great. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng: Hey guys, impressive quarter, great execution. Howard, I guess you noted backlog should carry through the near-term, but you know and as you will see some decline in product demand, can you kind of help parse that commentary a little more. Does that imply that you are expecting the year-over-year decline, the back half to accelerate from 2Q levels and when you think about 2021, appreciate a lot of moving pieces, especially on the policy front. How are you thinking about 2021 playing out on demand side?
Howard Nye: Yes, as we think about the back half 2020, I think to your point a lot can hinge on what does Q4 looks like, frankly from a weather perspective. But it is interesting, if we look at our commentary, much of what happened in the first half with some of that COVID related sure it was more of that in half one weather related in COVID. Probably so. If we look at backlogs it is interesting to me if we look at Mid-Atlantic, customer backlogs are actually up around 17%. If we look in Southwest, customer backlogs where up around 30. If we look into cement, and this is a big one, I mean, there have been around 43%. At the same time, if we look at readymix, those are down in the low double digits, but at the same time we are seeing those backlogs improve in Q3 particularly related to infrastructure. And if we look into West, we are seeing backlogs down in the low double digits of very high backlogs coming into the year because of the way that weather had been last year.  So I think in many respects, we are sensitive to where will states be with their safe funding, and their revenues as we enter half to end they are feeling potentially in some respects, more COVID pressure than they felt so far. Number one. Number two, what is going to happen to portions of non-res meaning particularly what happens to that that lighter piece of it? Look, obviously if we see some stimulus come through infrastructure is going to be in a pretty good place, but if we look at Q2, with volume down for, that to me feels like modest volume down, that feels like a normal typical cyclical reaction design. And I think as we are looking at three and we are looking at four, four can obviously weather affected, but again I think if we are just looking overall at what has happening in the United States, and what is happening globally for us to put our heads in the sand and say that there is not at least an opportunity for something that does not feel like the cycle did in the great recession, not at all. But could feel a bit like this quarter did, particularly as we go into Q3, which last year, as you will recall Phil, was a really big quarter for us. So you have got a tough compare. You know I think the commentary that you have offered is probably right.
Philip Ng: Got it. And that is really a helpful color. And when you talk about now and non-res, you, you know obviously there are some puts and takes, can you remind us what your exposure is, if you have any on the high rise side and then office, hospital and retail that might be a little weaker in terms of strength that you are seeing and heavy. Is that to kind of offset some of are those potential headwinds? Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thanks so much Phil. The fact is we are a Southeast, Southwest driven business, we are not in downtown Chicago, we are not in downtown Manhattan. So the business - that are growing tend to grow out. They don't tend as much to grow up, if you know what I mean. And the other thing that I will say and we said it in the prepared remarks is we have been very focused on moving our business intentionally over the last decade, so that we are more focused on these heavy non-res projects. If we look at the way non-res is held up, it has been in the high 30% of our business. If we look at really what that look like over a longer term, it ought to be closer to 30%. That is where it has been. Infrastructure should be more as a percentage than we have seen over the last several years, non-res candidly should be modestly less. We think we may see some of that, but equally as we look at the heavy projects that are really taking up a good bit of our time right now. We are seeing very attractive increasing bidding in that respect. I'm not sure that it totally offsets, but the life side of it could be but I think it is a nice counterbalance to it.
Philip Ng: Great. Thanks for the color.
Howard Nye: You bet Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: They thanks for the question. I know you have referenced 60% incremental lump aggregate gross profit in the past. But just given we did in the second quarter and the divergence between volume and pricing that we are seeing. Is there any way to breakdown detrimental or incremental as it relates to volume and price and how we should think about cost inflation? Or is there a level where pricing can't necessarily offset volumes, where you wouldn't see aggregate gross profit gross margin expansion?
James Nickolas: Well, I think theoretically, it is possible. We don't anticipate that to be the case. So the pricing is one thing we can bank on. We get it every quarter. It is sustainable and it does flow to the bottom line. So that is the most powerful weapon in our quiver. And So we have got that growing force. Additionally, this quarter into the foreseeable few quarters, we have got lower diesel prices. So that benefited this year, this quarter, it will benefit next quarter, the rest of this year I think. So those are things that we are expecting. Otherwise this is blocking, tackling with watching your variable cost, making sure you are flexing. The theoretical question you are posing. I mean, if volume drops tremendously, of course, your fixed costs, the absorption isn't there, where you need it to be. And that is where you run into some headwinds, but we don't see that happening quite frankly.
Howard Nye: Seldon, one thing, just from a color perspective, I will add to that. I think it is really important to underscore this. The recovery that ended with COVID was not a construction led recovery. And we have not seen that before in your lifetime or mine. And the fact is, we look particularly for housing is and the throughout the birth economy is required. We actually see a lot of things that lead us to believe that the post COVID recovery can and likely should be building led. The other thing that I would pointed out on Jim's commentary that was just entirely correct, is we are seeing nice price with volume down and with energy down. Oftentimes when we see energy going up, we actually see that as something that helps push ASPs up as well. So I wanted to make sure that we share that with you.
Seldon Clarke: Okay that is helpful. And then just piggybacking on an earlier question on volumes. How should we think about the dispersion on a relative basis across various product categories for volumes in the back half?
Howard Nye: Well, I think primarily, as I mentioned before, cement is being really resilient right now. I think we anticipate readymix continuing to be quite resilient, I think, and it is going to have a good year in the primary thing that we are speaking about and most of our commentary tends to be around aggregates and where that is going to be near-term and over the next few quarters. So that is how I would ask you to think about it right now so.
Seldon Clarke: Okay I appreciate the time. Thanks.
Howard Nye: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.
Garik Shmois: Great thanks. Just one more question on aggregate margins in the second half of the year. I mean you are painting a picture of volumes down kind of in this 3% to 4% range, assuming there is no major kind of change in trend or deceleration within markets? Pricing off low-single-digits, seems like diesel is going to be a tailwind? Is there anything that you can see be it from a comp perspective or stripping costs or inventories that could preclude margin expansion in the second half of the years, is it really just kind of a function of how the volumes look?
Howard Nye: Yes. I think it is two things, I think it is what kind of volume look and where the volumes look right. And I think part of what you are probably looking at and you are pleased with. I know I'm looking at and I'm pleased with it, is to see margin expansion despite the fact Mid-Atlantic had volumes down pretty considerably. So I think part of what I would ask you to keep in mind is Mid-Atlantic particularly with some of the headwinds that NCDOT has right now. We will probably have a more challenged year-over-year volume than other parts of the business. And again, that is a very high margin part of our business. So what you are seeing is great improvement in other parts of the business, we are seeing DOT in North Carolina putting itself in a position that really is we start getting into next year. It is going to look and feel a lot more normal relative to what history has been. But I do think that geographic mixed issue is one that you understand and it is worth noting.
Garik Shmois: Great thank you. Follow-up question on cement. How much of the cement volume goes into West Texas oil and gas markets and the headwind of pricing in Texas is this mostly a function of mix or are you seeing more competitive landscape in the West region that has been packing things.
Howard Nye: Yes. actually that is a great question Garik. And here is what I would say. We don't send significant volumes to West Texas. Clearly the biggest volumes that we have will be in DFW and in San Antonio and then those related markets. So if we go back and look I want to say full-year last year, you are probably looking at 30,000 or 40,000 tons of what's gone into West Texas those would not have been notable numbers. If you look purely at pricing though, here is what is worth noting. ASPs in West Texas are $200. If we look at really what the numbers look like in North, Texas and Central, we were seeing price increases in the range of around 4% Garik. So if you are seeing a 4% price there and you are getting back to the numbers that you would have expected, it is not the $8 going into the year, but if we are looking at overall same-on-same 4% price up in cement in Texas with down volumes that is a pretty good number. So if you look at more profitability, volumes down price up, actually much better efficiencies. And the other thing to keep in mind Garik is we actually anticipate having less - downtime and maintenance spend on terms this year than we did last year. We think it is probably going to be about $7 million less in 2020 than it was in 2019. So when you really stack up the issues relative to the cement business, we think it is pretty attractive. And Garik you were there at the time too. You will remember that one of the things that we thought was possible was to have particular pricing in cement in Texas, look overtime, at least relative to a stability perspective, more like aggregate pricing debt. And I think that is exactly what we saw in this quarter. And as you also know, we have been willing when we needed to give up share in that marketplace to continue to be resilient in pricing. So if we go back to 2014, we had a 22% share in that market. If we look at it today based on contract numbers, we are at about 19%, but pricing is behaving in profitability is going up. Garik does that help?
Garik Shmois: It sure did. Thanks for the help and that is all.
Howard Nye: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey good morning Howard and Jim. Hey Howard how is private demand in North Carolina. Has that helping to offset weak DOT?
Howard Nye: Yes, private demand is pretty good. I mean, look housing is good in the state and it is going to be good in the state, private non-res is good in the state. It varies by geography. Charlotte's actually having a pretty good year. Raleigh Durham is having a pretty good year. Greensboro is not having a year but Raleigh Durham Chapel Hill is happening is happening the year that Charlotte had. And going to it was actually from an ASP perspective, a very attractive market for us. But the private is holding up pretty well in part because Josh has held up reasonably well here Adam. And look at the end of the day you got a lot of people moving to North Carolina and population is always going to be your single biggest driver of aggregate consumption.
Adam Thalhimer: And then in Texas, how do your backlogs work in Texas and the Austin, I guess as a real surprise to see peel off some aggregates exposure in Austin, can you talk about that too?
Howard Nye: Actually, we didn't see any aggregate exposure in Austin. We sold some businesses called ArkLaTex. And so the only thing we did in Austin is we sold a depleted standing gravel location. So that that was purely an excess property. And that is what Jim was referencing, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a depleted site for $100 million. So actually I have to tell you from the way we look at that, that is a really nice win. So we did not get rid of any aggregates that were there. And again, back to your point, if we are looking at backlogs and asked specifically about Texas, Southwest backlogs are up about 30%. And if we looked into cement, they are up about 43% and if we look in readymix, they are down low double-digits but actually somewhat recovering right now due to some Q3 building activity.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks Howard.
Howard Nye: You are welcome Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.
Stanley Elliott: Hey good morning everybody. Thank you all for fitting me in. Howard - the infrastructure piece, I mean it sounds like the states are doing better than what we would have guessed kind of given the initial shock. There are some discussions around, the federal government providing money to state, we also talked about a [CR] (Ph) kind of worst case scenario being flat. Will that keep infrastructure volumes pretty consistent into next year? Just like in the past, we have had CR just been up and down, up and down and hard to get a gauge, but it just feels different this time around, given all of those things I have mentioned plus, you know just a general higher level of funding coming in from the state side.
Howard Nye: Yes, I think two things Stanley. One, I think if you really get some significant phase for stimulus there is - the zip code of what AASHTO looking in for that 37 billion, and it is going directly to state DOTs. I think that is actually a really important amount of money that would fill a hole. So we will begin with that. I think to your second point relative to the CR, I think you raised a really good point. And I think part of what happened in the last downturn and you will remember it well Stanley because you are watching it, the CRs in that ended up oftentimes being very short-term, and that is why I made the comment earlier, people shouldn't be surprised, if you see out of the box, a long-term CR. And a long-term CR does not mean it is going to be in place for long-term, is simply done to make sure states continue to know that they can plan longer term as Congress goes about the process of probably having a conference and then coming up with a new infrastructure bill. So I think to your point, yes, I think this does feel better than last time, because I think whatever CR going to go in will be longer. I think whatever highway bill we get out will be larger. And I think one of your swing factors is brought to space for look like relative to A to the space. And I think we will know that here in the next - I think by the end of August, we will have a pretty good feel for what that is going to look like.
Stanley Elliott: Yes. I guess the good news is, we haven’t seen a whole lot of wholesale project cancellations. But can you talk about how you will and really the rest of the industry has been able to manage inventory levels, how do you feel about them going into the back half a year? And I think about that kind of in the context of pricing and then as we look out?
James Nickolas: Hey Stan it is Jim. Our original levels as in both constant of slightly up from a year ago and question from Q1, but no outsize moves there. And so that is just roughly prefer study production levels to offset each shipment levels. So that is pretty even keel there's no shortage is in sight, so there is quite rebalances at the moment.
Howard Nye: And we don't see that having an effect good better otherwise on ASP. We think ASPs just all is going to behave well.
Stanley Elliott: I agree, I was just trying to make sure that others within the space are being as diligent as you guys are. So I appreciate the commentary. Talk to you soon.
Howard Nye: Thanks Stanley.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: Howard congratulations on a strong quarter 3.55 gross margins with that volume numbers fantastic. And I guess or I wanted explore a little further, maybe a question was asked earlier, let me try a slightly different angle. You know you talked about infrastructure non-res and res and what is your longer term target percentages or proportions might be within the business. The mid-40s for the infrastructure and 30% non-res and so on. I guess the question is, I guess that type of a proportional mix right now, what would be the variance from that 35.5 gross margin this quarter?
Howard Nye: You know what, I don't think you would see a big movement in that particularly David. The only things that I think that may be different in that. I think housing might be a bigger piece of our pie, maybe for the foreseeable future than it would have historically. So if you think about it- David, if we looked at those numbers a decade plus ago, just the numbers very similar to what you just said, probably 45% of prospective 30% non-res probably low-teens, residential and then the rest would be ChemRock and Rail. I think res can stay elevated for a while, I think that is actually going to be good for us. Because I do think depending on the type of res, you know that could actually be good for ASPs. And I think the more single family housing that we see that it is going to be helpful. But again, I think that might help a little bit on the margin side. But overall, I think the margins that you have seen are - I don't think that was going to be end use driven.
David MacGregor: Okay. Just my second question, I guess on pricing, if we were to adjust those Bluegrass impacts from a year ago. What's your pricing at the end of this quarter?
Howard Nye: You know I don't know that we had that per se. One thing I'm happy to tell you is we saw pricing in Maryland, up around 6.4%. So if you are looking to glean, we are getting some nice synergies from that in Bluegrass, we are. But I would really rather not go back and break up what that looks like. Because it is so integrated into our business particularly in places like Georgia today, but it gives you a good snapshot of what the Maryland business that really had very little synergy brought together, operationally has done relative to pricing.
David MacGregor: Alright. That makes sense. Well thanks very much and good luck.
Howard Nye: Thanks so much David.
Operator: The next question comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.
Rohit Seth: Hey Howard, thanks for taking my question. I just noticed in your CEO commentary you talked about sort of 2025, and I was just curious in sort of 2025, do you have plans to rebalance the footprint performs very well the cycle, acquisitions with the organic growth is only up maybe one of the past five years. So just curious as we think in the front itself an infrastructure bill, highway bill, Texas clearly has very good run over last seven years, how you think about portfolio and where the opportunities are.
Howard Nye: Yes. I guess what I would say is this Rohit, we have got two opportunities. We have got the opportunity to keep doing just what you saw in this quarter, and that is make the Martin Marietta that we have better. And I think that is what you saw in the quarter performance perspective. I think the other piece is we have got white space on the map that we can continue to move toward. And what I mean by that is, we have talked a lot, whether it was in sort of 2020 and you will hear in sort of 2025, where people are going is going to be what drives aggregate consumption and the mega regions across the United States is where people are going to be living. And we have demonstrated that obviously in an aggregates sled business we can continue to expand margin. So product what I liked about the Martin Marietta story is we have turned this business into one of the great aggregates companies in the world. I think it is one of the great materials companies in the world. We can continue to make it better and we can continue to grow it. And that is something that if I'm you, I would continue to expect Martin Marietta to do. And I would just say, go back and look at sort of 2020, and we have given you a pretty good roadmap of places that we would like to grow. The other thing that I would say relative to rebalancing when you look at a decade that went from one or two and 65% of our markets at the beginning of the decade to one or two and 90% of our markets by the end of the decade, also, we were looking for that leading position in markets that we find attractive. So we don't feel like in our heritage footprint, that there is an enormous amount of work to be done. There are some careful work to be done on occasion. And an example of that would be what we discussed earlier and that is the sale of the ArkLaTex ready-mix business. We didn't find that particularly a great fit for our aggregates led in Texas and so we pruned that. But that is the type of work that you should expect on the heritage portfolio. And you should expect us to continue to look to grow in new markets where we can find our way to one or two. 
Rohit Seth: Alright. Thanks that is all I have.
Howard Nye: Alright. Thank you Rohit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, afternoon, gentlemen. Just quickly, Howard in your prepared remarks you talked about in early this month a restructuring internally. Maybe you can share with more of the construct on that. That is something to toward your sort 2025 campaign. And is there just more efficiencies driven by that or just different strategies on the pricing or business front, just how you think through that as you are and even head towards your restructuring [Low Audio].
Howard Nye: Mike that is a great question thank you for it. It is funny how timing works, we started talking to our Board, literally last August about the restructuring that was announced, that was effective on July 1, of this year. And what we did is we just - down some of our aggregate divisions. So what we have now is a Western division that is run out of Denver, we have a Southwest division that is run out of Dallas. We have an East division that is run here in Raleigh. And we have a Central division that is run out of Indianapolis and then we have our Magnesia Specialties business as well. So the retirements are part of that, where efficiencies are part of that, and it is the ability for that structure to endure to get people whether they are division presence, [PPGMs] (Ph), or otherwise, expanded responsibilities and growth in their careers, all of those things help drive decision. The nice thing is of course your benefit is you get efficiencies from it. And we were very fortuitous to be in a spot that this is what we were looking to do, even in a pre-COVID world, and then COVID comes along, and the very thoughtful planning that we had to your point as a part of sort of 2020 and as a part of sort of 2025 coalesced very nicely with a timing need, and it simply could not have worked better.
Michael Dudas: Just my final follow-up would be, speaking of COVID, have you noticed anything, with the lockdowns or restarts in your important state, that are the tenured - thought process from your private customers or from the government or maybe some slowing in the pace of activity or bidding or letting because of some of the fears we see and hear constantly, and then from the media? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Again thanks for that question. The fact is, as I tried to mention, whether at least for the quarter was probably more impactful than COVID was, but we would be naive to say that there wasn't a COVID effect out there. So, NCDOT feeling some degree of the rest pre-COVID, I'm sure they were. Are they feeling a little bit more postcode? Yes, they are. And so has that affected volumes, and with that particular department? It has. Has it affected some other DOTs and modest rates? To be sure it has. It is fairly effective some private businesses too. It is tough to fully quantify exactly what that is. But I do think people recognize how to live and how to work with this. And part of what has been interesting to me as we have operated all the way through this as an essential business and our nearly 9000 employee count, we have had about [90] (Ph) positive probate cases, the vast majority of which have gone home, recovered at home and come back to work. And we have only had literally a handful of what we have been able to identify as employee to employee COVID spread cases. So I think businesses, governments and others have learned how to work with us. It has clearly had an effect, it is going to have an effect for a period of time. I think the actual steward effect there become less, not more. And we will have to watch and see what the physical effects are, and how governmental stimulus works.
Michael Dudas: That is encouraging. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] D.A. Davidson.
Unidentified Analyst: So first off on the cement side of thing, do you have any commentary around the timing of planned maintenance expenses for cement this year, as well as any thoughts around a potential another cement price increase?
Howard Nye: Well what I would say a cement price increases will come out again next year. So our intention is to come out typically once a year and put the price increases then so there shouldn't be any more on price increases this year. If we are looking at what cadence is going to be you know right now, we are forecasting probably about $3.5 million or $3.6 million worth of outage costs. So these are outage processes, I think that is what you are asking about in Q3. We are looking at probably around 0.5 million of those in Q4. And if you tell you that we did in Q1 and Q2, that means our total count outage costs for the year will be in the zip code of around $19.5 million, and that is about $6.9 million less than we saw in 2019.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And then also on SOAR 2025, are you guys thinking about providing some more specific parameters or financial aspirations related to that this fiscal year?
Howard Nye: The short answer is yes, we will. But we have got one important step that we need to do before we do that and that is, we need to present it to our Board of Directors. And that is exactly what management is going to do when the Board is here next month, or here in just a few weeks. And I'm sure as we come out later in the year and early next year. We can give you a much clearer picture of what our goals and intentions are on the SOAR 2025.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. I appreciate it. Thank you guys.
Howard Nye: You bet. Thanks.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. 
Howard Nye: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With our stead fast commitment to safety, cost discipline and operational excellence Martin Marietta has the right strategic priorities and best-in-class teams to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. We are moving forward with confidence and determination. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2020 results in just a few months. As always we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Suzanne, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.  We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q1 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. We will reference this information during today's call. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on the state of our business in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the actions we have and are taking and the strength of our positioning to manage the current environment. Jim Nickolas will then review our first quarter 2020 financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow Ward's closing remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. First and foremost, we hope that you and your families are and remain safe and healthy as we confront the challenges and uncertainties presented by COVID-19.  I also want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Martin Marietta team. I'm tremendously proud of how everyone is working together to manage through this unprecedented time and how the character of our employees has shown through. Day after day, Martin Marietta employees are safely and resolutely meeting the critical needs of our customers. They're also supporting their local communities in both large and small ways donating vital supplies and equipment to health care workers and first responders, helping neighbors by picking up groceries and ensuring our colleagues are well cared for and safe. Our team has shown great courage, determination and resilience as we successfully meet our stakeholders' needs while never losing sight of our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community and stewardship.  These values define us and our character. We look at these foundational principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, particularly during difficult times. Martin Marietta remains open as an essential business. That designation means we're continuing to provide heavy building materials and services to our customers even in those areas with shelter-in-place orders. Communities across the nation must maintain their vital infrastructure and we're working hard to support that objective in a safe, efficient and responsible way.  Through the end of April, our workforce, operations and supply chains have seen little disruption. We believe this is largely due to our company's decisive steps early to respond quickly to this pandemic, our domestic focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials and our expanded safety procedures, all of which are designed to protect Martin Marietta employees and the organizational health of the company.  During this pivotal time, our focus is threefold: communication, resource management and business continuity. We've implemented new robust protocols and practices, including remote working, social distancing and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, consistent with guidelines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the medical professionals who partner with the industrial hygienist familiar with our operations. These protocols were updated on an ongoing basis as public experts provide additional guidance. We also established a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, canceled all nonessential business travel and in-person meetings and established contingency plans with respect to staffing, and we've been actively engaged enterprise-wide to enhance the substance and frequency of our communications to ensure the flow of the most accurate and timely information about our operations, thus enabling our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to stay fully informed.  Our operations teams have shown considerable agility, flexibility and perseverance while keeping our business running smoothly. Among other things, they've taken timely and responsible steps to clean and disinfect their facilities, while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize any COVID-19 exposure. Thanks to their dedication and effectiveness, our company has adapted extraordinarily well.  Additionally, for our colleagues that typically work in doors in close proximity to one another, we're utilizing a combination of social distancing as well as work-from-home protocols. Our employees are dutifully meeting their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible.  Importantly, whether working at an operating site, an office or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for one another. With our team's safe and employee engagement high, we can be attentive to our other stakeholders, our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders and communities as we have an essential business to run.  As disclosed in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered strong first quarter financial and operational performance. Jim will discuss these results with you shortly. Let me first say that we're proud of these results, which underscore our commitment to operational excellence and to our disciplined strategies. While we had a promising start of what we believe would have been a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with an unprecedented level of uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and societal outcomes continue to unfold. Accordingly, while we remain confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance issued back in February.  We've not yet seen contractors and customers delaying or canceling building projects in a material way. While we typically do not comment on intra-quarter trends, these are atypical times. We're making an exception and as highlighted on our supplemental information Slides 13 and 14, we are sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency as to what we're now seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month.  Specifically, for the month of April, aggregate shipments remained elevated in most areas but did not match the near-record April 2019 volumes. We saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado and Indiana. Cement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to prior year levels. The one notable exception is oil well cement shipments as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices. Ready mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity.  April revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the comparable prior year period. Demand for our lime and periclase products has slowed dramatically as steel-producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers beginning in mid-March.  In terms of April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were broadly implemented earlier in the year. Cement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were highly confident in realizing the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given overwhelming market support in a tight Texas cement environment.  Ready mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels. We'll have a clearer picture of ready mixed concrete pricing trends for the remainder of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies unfold. Though ours is a basic and durable industry, it does not mean that we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Our economy is interconnected and dislocations in consumer behavior or other industries may impact Martin Marietta. As such, looking beyond April, we anticipate product demand will soften in the coming months, with the private sector feeling the effects sooner than the public sector. The timing, duration and extent of weaker demand levels are presently unknown. Infrastructure, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to be the most resilient of the company's 3 primary end uses in the near term. The vast majority of state departments of transportation are operational and continue to advertise and award projects. Nonetheless, we expect many state DOT budgets will face temporary headwinds from lower fuel taxes, tolls, user fees and other related revenue collections as much of the nation has been sheltered in place.  The impact of lower funding levels is expected to become more meaningful in the second half of 2020, absent congressional action and will vary considerably among the states. Florida DOT, for example, has accelerated over $2 billion of critical transportation projects to leverage construction efficiencies resulting from lower vehicle traffic, including closing additional travel lanes and performing more daytime hours work. To help mitigate state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to address surface transportation in the Phase 4 emergency relief and economic recovery COVID-19 legislation. The first recommendation is the federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next 18 months. The second recommendation is the passage of a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package. We believe our industry is better equipped than in recent history to execute on an infrastructure build given the backlog of fully designed projects.  Nonresidential construction activity on existing projects has broadly continued in most regions. However, many commercial projects and the engineering or planning stages are being delayed or canceled, particularly for office, retail and hospitality. Some industrial activity, on the other hand, is not expected to experience significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to perform relatively well in the current environment, as businesses increase e-commerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services.  Similarly, large energy sector projects along the Gulf Coast of Texas that are already underway are expected to continue.  The residential market is expected to experience the most rapid and perhaps steepest decline from the impacts of COVID-19 as unemployment and general economic instability of home buyers and home developers to delay plans. However, in contrast to the Great Recession, we do not anticipate a prolonged period of reduced residential activity. Today's housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite notable population gains in Martin Marietta states and to benefit from historically low interest rates.  As we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture. As I emphasized earlier, the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders remains our top priority. With established protections in place to accomplish this, we're focused on our business priorities of generating cash flow, preserving liquidity and adjusting costs to align with product demand. Our team has developed extensive plans for a variety of economic scenarios, and we're ready to implement them with immediacy and integrity as warranted.  In addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've cut nonessential costs, reduced capital spending for discretionary projects and implemented hiring restrictions. We're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand consistent with our commitment to being prudent stewards of shareholders' capital. We will reevaluate these actions as visibility improves.  Having the right strategy, making the right decisions at the right time, and being able to safely execute them does matter a lot. And Martin Marietta will do just that. We're well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to successfully manage through today's unprecedented environment and emerge more resilient and capable.  How so? First, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared with any previous downturn in our more than 25 years as a public company. This is noteworthy, considering we navigated through the Great Recession and remain profitable throughout, never suspended or cut a dividend and emerged with a healthy balance sheet. Today, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only considerably expanded but also improved. Moreover, we continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategic plans, carefully positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. These strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms, but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass. We now have leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale and cost flexibility.  Second, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise. Together, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders as recently demonstrated by our 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative shareholder return performance. This is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry ever experienced.  In uncertain evolving times, proven cycle tested leadership and experience is critical. In brief, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience and teams to responsibly manage us through these challenging times.  I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed financial review. Jim?
James Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. I will briefly highlight our first quarter results as well as provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies. As detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. On a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record. Gross profit was relatively flat. Selling, general and administrative expenses improved 10 basis points as a percent of total revenues. Diluted earnings per share was $0.41 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, decreased 6% to $149 million.  The Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues. Across our geographic footprint, product demand trends remain strong, even in the Texas and North Georgia markets that experienced record or near-record precipitation levels. Aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete pricing also improved, with all divisions contributing to the solid growth, a testament to the strength of our markets, and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. Building Materials gross profit improved slightly. Key takeaways include the following: aggregates product gross profit decreased $5 million, largely due to our quarterly update of inventory standard costs. Our per ton production costs have been trending downward over the last 12 months as cost control measures and operating efficiencies have their desired effect. All else equal, this would result in higher operating margins going forward. But in this quarter, it also resulted in a $4 million expense as we reflected the lower cost in our updated inventory valuation.  In contrast, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to reflect the higher production costs experienced during the weather-impacted year in 2018. While this cumulative $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, lower unit production costs will provide future benefits.  Cement product gross margin expanded 1,170 basis points driven by improved cost absorption from higher production levels as well as increased shipments to the San Antonio, Austin and Houston markets. Pricing gains, combined with lower maintenance and energy expenses also contributed to the improved margin.  Gross profit for the ready mixed concrete business declined $9 million. Pricing improvements and double-digit shipment growth in Colorado were more than offset by lower Texas volumes from record rainfall, delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as well as increased raw material costs.  For the Magnesia Specialties business, product revenues decreased 13%, consistent with expectations as chemicals customers continue to reduce inventory levels for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, product gross margin improved 500 basis points despite lower revenues, driven by ongoing cost control measures and lower energy costs. We still currently anticipate the destocking trend of our chemicals customers to be transitory in nature.  Our consolidated results included several items that affect comparability with the prior year quarter. To provide additional clarity, we included a slide in the Q1 2020 supplemental information posted on our website that provides a normalized view of pretax earnings with the items affecting comparability removed from both current and prior year quarters. In addition to the aggregates inventory standard adjustments discussed earlier, these items also included $6 million of other nonoperating expenses to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of approximately $7 million, which drove the low-income tax rate for the first quarter 2020. Lastly, we incurred a noncash expense of $2 million to implement a new paid time-off policy for our employees. As you will see on Slide 5, first quarter 2020 earnings before income tax, absent items affecting comparability, improved $15 million.  Moving on now to our capital structure. Throughout our history, Martin Marietta has operated with a growth mindset, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet to preserve our financial flexibility. As a result, we have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future. Given today's environment, that is an enviable place to be. We will continue to balance our long-standing, disciplined capital allocation priorities to maintain that flexibility. Our priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile.  Our approach is intended to ensure our cash flows are sufficient for a range of scenarios. In today's uncertain environment, that range of scenarios is broader and actions to enhance cash flows and preserve liquidity are even more important. Before the extent of the economic disruption became better understood, we repurchased 211,000 shares during the first quarter. Since then, we have temporarily paused share repurchases. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and as circumstances change, we will revisit this pause in our share repurchase program.  To further bolster cash flows, as Ward mentioned, we are reducing our capital spending for discretionary projects. We now estimate full year capital expenditures will be $325 million to $350 million, down from our original guidance of $425 million to $475 million. We demonstrated our ability to pull back on capital spending in safe and prudent ways that did not damage the business in the long run during the Great Recession. We are doing that again now as appropriate.  We've strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position with our timely bond offering in early March, issuing $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon. Proceeds will be used to repay the $300 million of floating rate notes that mature later this month, with the bulk of the remaining cash preserved on the balance sheet.  Looking forward, as you can see in our supplemental information slides, after satisfying the May repayment, we will have no additional bond maturities for more than 4 years. We are confident in our liquidity position. Net cash, combined with the nearly $760 million available on our existing revolving facilities, provided total liquidity of approximately $880 million at the end of the quarter. Additionally, at 2.3x net debt to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we remain well within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for some closing comments.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim. In summary, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and enhanced liquidity. In regards to our 2020 full year guidance, we will reinstate earnings guidance once we have sufficient visibility to do so. That said, we remain confident that the attractive underlying market fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in our key geographies, both of which underpin the company's record 2019 performance and strong first quarter 2020 results, remain intact and will be evident once again as the U.S. economy stabilizes and recovers.  Martin Marietta is well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to responsibly navigate today's extraordinary environment and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move forward. We have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans positioning our business as an aggregates leader in attractive high-growth geographies, aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities and prudently allocating capital while maintaining financial flexibility. In doing so, we have built a business that is durable, resilient and stronger than ever. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens.
Trey Grooms: So my first question is really around the state tax receipts that you mentioned being down, of course, and you talked about the possibility of 30% -- being down 30% or so over the next 18 months for DOT. Also, you got in the background, the FAST Act expiring this year. You guys have a lot more boots on the ground than most around this. So I wanted to get your opinion, first off, on how you think all this shakes out with some of the states are coming together and asking for, you mentioned the $50 billion there. But how do you think this shakes out from where we sit today? And then as my follow-up, if we don't get anything from the Fed to bridge the gap, when would that start to impact state lettings and then ultimately, aggregates demand?
Howard Nye: Great. Thanks for your question. Look, I think a couple of things are worth noting. To your point, AASHTO is the one that has come out and asked for the $50 billion infusion from the federal government to states. And again, you're exactly right. That's taking into account that they are seeing something that could be a 30% delta in gas tax collections. So we'll see where that goes from the federal perspective. That's probably going to take a few months to see. I think on a state-by-state basis, what you're likely to see, Trey, our states are going to have to come back and their legislatures are going to have to address funding for different DOTs.  And I think that's going to vary pretty considerably. If we look at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their DOTs are in a pretty healthy place. And they've got a very healthy rainy day fund. They're indicating, for example, that they don't see a need go to that during this first year. So the fact is, depending on how revenues come in, places like TxDOT may not need to go there at all. States like Colorado, which is our second largest by revenue, have the ability should their treasurer choose to issue certificates of participation and we think those types of levers, you can keep Colorado DOT in a very good place. North Carolina DOT is in a similar spot. We've discussed the fact historically that they've had some storm issues that they needed to manage through and they had some issues relative to some litigation, commonly referred to as the Map Act. COVID-19 has made that a bit more complicated for North Carolina DOT. The legislature is in session. They are looking at several things that they can do in that state. One thing that's worth noting, and of course, it's here in our backyard, we actually, over the last couple of years, have been very successful in bidding on work here in North Carolina. So for example, one of your concerns is what would tonnage look like going forward, we booked over 10 million tons of aggregates on 6 large NCDOT projects in North Carolina.  And we've only shipped about 600,000 of that 10 million. So to your point, could different states feel different degrees of pressure, they probably will. Do we think Southeastern and Southwestern states that tend to be our leading states will come through that better than most? We think so. Do we think existing projects that are underway will continue going? I think the answer to that is, we believe strongly that, that will be the case. And I think you could see some instances in the second half of people looking at bidding activity a little bit more carefully, particularly relative to maintenance in public. But again, Trey, we see this as being pretty steady and pretty resilient, and there will be some one-offs here or there and legislatures will need to endeavor to deal with it. And we think we will likely get some help from the federal government. The last thing that I'll add to it is I do think this gives increased impetus as we said in the prepared remarks, toward getting a successor to the FAST Act.  My view has long been that the Senate plan is likely to be the one that will be pushed forward. As you recall, that's a $287 billion, 5-year plan that basically is looking at a pretty significant increase of our FAST Act funding levels. So we feel like that would be a very worthwhile and useful endeavor for our friends in Washington.
Trey Grooms: Thank you for the color on that, Ward. And my second question is on just pricing. Aggs historically has been very resilient through downturns. Do you see anything in your markets? Or do you think anything has changed to where that wouldn't be the case if volume was to drop significantly?
Howard Nye: Look, I think the markets are better suited today than they were last time and they did great last time. And I don't see anything that gives me any concerns around the aggregates pricing thesis. I think that works. If you look at the quarter, you can look at our quarter and say the numbers were a little lower than we thought. The fact is we saw really big increases in volume in our Central division and our West division. And our Central division has an ASP as just our West division that are lower than corporate-wide ASPs. So I would not let Q1 pricing give you any degree of concern around the overall thesis. As you could tell from our supplemental materials, once you got into April, you saw pricing with a 4 handle in front of it. The other thing that I would say, Trey, is I think you will see greater resilience in cement, particularly in our business in Texas as well this year. We think we're going to continue despite these recent trends with COVID-19 to see good solid price increases in Texas cement. So again, if we look at aggregates, no, I don't think anything has changed there. If anything, it's better. And I think cement is better as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research.
Kathryn Thompson: A follow-up on the North Carolina DOT. Could you confirm for those listening that the 10 million tons you outlined is funded? And could you give a little bit more color on the timing and flow through these tons?
Howard Nye: Yes. No, the 10 million tons from everything that we have seen and gleaned, yes, is funded and we anticipate those projects will be going. They tend to be, though they're not wholly, in Eastern North Carolina, and they're going to be going through '20 and '21. So we see those projects as being certainly through the rest of this year and into next year, Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay. And then a lot of different puts and takes on margins and appreciate the color you have both in your PowerPoint and prepared commentary today. But taking a step back could you give a little bit more color on a basis point standpoint or a dollar standpoint, the bridge on margins in the quarter? Also focusing on the geographic, what's geographic, what's onetime or any other factor that's relevant?
Howard Nye: Sure. Absolutely, Kathryn. I'm going to give you a couple of broad side views on that and ask Jim to talk you through a more detailed review. As you could tell, what's always interesting to me is when we have an inventory variation and it goes down. People who are uninformed will look at that and be troubled by it. Actually, that's something that we celebrate inside because it actually means our costs are going down, which is exactly what you want and exactly what our shareholders want. So what we saw in part was a change in inventory because our costs were getting better. Part of what we can talk through as well is a certain degree of geographic mix shift that we saw change. For example, our Central division saw volumes up over 20% in the quarter. Our West division saw volumes up over 15% in the quarter. And to give you a sense of it, central ASPs are in the mid-12s as our western ASPs and you look at overall ASPs at 14.80. So when you go through that, you start to get a sense of what could be modestly different as you go through a bridge in a quarter that remember, is our lowest volume quarter. So things can feel oversized in that. What I'll tell you is the more you look at this quarter, the more you're going to like this quarter, and let me turn it over to Jim. He can walk you through while I feel that way.
James Nickolas: Yes. Thanks, Ward. So we -- Kathryn, we put in the supplemental slides that walk. Walking folks from the Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year simply to help illustrate the improved quality of earnings this year versus last year. So kind of to put numbers to the descriptions that Ward just gave, the inventory revaluation item, that was $15 million that by itself is equivalent to 60 incremental margin basis points. In addition, the geographic mix from a margin perspective was about $10 million. So that's about 40 incremental margin basis points. A couple other items.  We had increased production. So our cost absorption was very good. That was slightly offset but not wholly offset by higher freight costs. So those 2 combined, netted out to about 8 basis points you would add back. And then lastly, diesel is a tailwind for the quarter. And if you want to pull that out to kind of keep it normalized, that equates to about 60 million -- sorry, 16 basis points. From an incremental perspective, it was $4 million. So the puts and takes, if you add all that up, the ins, the outs gets us to right around 55% to 60% incremental margin.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, that was a lot of math and a lot of color, but I hope that helped.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.
Garik Shmois: I wanted to ask on your view on margins moving forward, specifically decremental margins. I mean you tend to deliver about 60% aggregate incrementals in an upcycle, but given potential volume declines over the next several quarters, how should we think about decremental margins moving forward?
James Nickolas: Yes. I think theoretically, it should be the same going down as it is going up. We will endeavor to do better than that. We've got cost-reduction plans ready to go. If things get materially worse, we don't see it getting surely worse necessarily, but we're ready for that. So I think for now, it's probably safest to assume a symmetrical approach going up and going down.
Howard Nye: But Garik, what you should expect is just what Jim said. And in prepared comments, we said we are going to adjust costs as we go through a volume profile as well. I think part of what's important to remember is what we outlined, this is a business that was always profitable and never cut a dividend. And I think we can surprise in any marketplace today.
Garik Shmois: Okay. Follow-up question is on nonres. Can you remind us how much of your nonres is split between the more cyclical office retail piece that you cited is expected to be softer in the coming months versus the heavy nonres that is holding up a bit better?
Howard Nye: I'm going to give you a historic, and I'm going to give you a closer to real time. So historic, in a normal time, you would have expected about 30% of our business to have been nonres. You would have expected about half of that 30% or 15% to be heavy. You would have expected about 15% of it to have been lighter, meaning more office, retail, et cetera. Actually, what we've seen is it's trended modestly more toward heavy. And you can imagine why because more people are shopping behind a keyboard as opposed to in a shopping center. So while housing has been relatively good, retail, that typically would have fallen housing, has not been as robust and it shifted more toward warehousing and the Amazonation of United States.  And that's actually something that we've benefited from. So what I would say, Garik, is if you look historically at a phase, say, that ended at the first -- at the end of the first quarter, you would have expected a bigger piece of that than really we've seen being office and retail. It tends to be modestly more heavy today. If we go into a deeper government-mandated recession, and that's how I like to think about this one, you could certainly see the heavy side of it being a larger percentage. But at least historically, that's where it's been, that's where it is as we finish the first quarter and we finished April. And as we think about what it could look like going forward, we tried to outline in the prepared remarks that it could be that light side of nonres that could feel some components of that earlier rather than later. So it's going to be, call it, probably low double digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.
Philip Ng: Glad to hear Texas cement pricing seems quite robust, and your expectation was to get the full $8.
Howard Nye: No, no, no...
Philip Ng: Initially. Initially, before COVID
Howard Nye: Okay.
Philip Ng: So that's a good place. And that market has obviously been undersupplied for some time now. The color that you provided in deck in April, it looks like pretty good momentum there. How much of that's incremental pricing versus carryover pricing? And then this is a higher fixed cost business, how should we think about decrementals for cement?
Howard Nye: I think cement is going to hang in there pretty well. I mean what I would say back to your first part on pricing. I mean obviously we came into the year feeling very good about pricing, feeling very good about the 8 up until COVID. I still think we're going to get price increases in Texas. And that ties back into the commentary that we have overall on aggregate pricing thesis being very tight, cement actually getting better. In fairness, Phil, I think pricing is going to be better in the north than it's going to be in the south, but I think you're going to get it in both places. And again, I think we're -- you're going to see very good cost control in cement this year.  For example, if we're looking at our kiln maintenance expenses year-over-year, we're anticipating that they're going to be about $7.6 million less in '20 than they were in '19. Part of what you saw in Q1 is there are about $2.8 million less in Q1 of '20 than they were in '19. So it's hard to know exactly how to address the margin issue there. You obviously saw very attractive margins for the first quarter. Because that business does have a higher fixed cost. But again, we've put over the last decade, about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. I think we've got cement plants in Texas that are close to state of the art. We're utilizing very different energy resources at that facility today that are reducing our costs. So we think our cost profile will be good. We think our pricing profile is getting better. And actually part of what we're liking too is I think if you're seeing good aggregate pricing, good cement pricing, you're likely to see a much more steady market relative to ready mix as well. So Phil, I've given you a lot of color around the way that, that business is operating now and what the change is year-over-year. And why we feel confident with that business as it sits. I hope that's helpful and responsive.
Philip Ng: That's super helpful. And then appreciate the deck where you gave us April trends, and this is not very scientific, just eyeballing. It looks like might be down mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Appreciate April, last year might have been like a record year. Any color on how April performed last year? And then any color on how we should think about the rest of the 2Q in terms of demand trends? I think Jim just mentioned that he's not expecting a material decline going forward. I just want to triangulate all that.
Howard Nye: Yes. Look, what I'd tell you is last year in April was near-record April. So what I'll tell you is April, looking at these trends that you saw felt very good. And even if you look at those charts on, I guess, supplemental Slide 13, it shows a little bit of a dip in early April. And by the way, we call that Easter. So that's exactly what that was. So again, if you look last year at a near-record April, if you look at very solid volumes this year in April, if you look at a better pricing environment. And of course, part of what we spoke about earlier in the call, with the odd conversation on the inventories, is the cost profile is getting better. Look, it's hard not to triangulate around those three things and feel like you've got a very durable business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.
Stanley Elliott: On the residential market, how quickly can -- if the economy start to reopen, people feel good about things or better about things, I guess, on a relative basis. How quickly can some of these residential projects get the green light to go ahead, i.e., could we end up seeing some of those volumes in the back part of the year?
Howard Nye: Yes, I think you could. I mean let's look at it in two different ways, Stanley. Let's look at what the world looked like before the government-mandated recession. So housing was healthy through March. Permits were up 7.4% versus prior year. If we look states that matter to us, Texas was up 10.5%. Florida was up almost 11%, North Carolina was up almost 9%. So to your point, very healthy housing marketplace then comes down a series of shelter-in-place orders. And obviously, you see confidence turn pretty quickly from the end of the year when it was high. To what it felt like toward the end of March. Here's what I would say. If we look at regions that have declined and they all have, the Northeast has declined the most. The Midwest has declined next the most.  And then the one that has declined the least, to your point, has been the South. And if you think about where we have built our business, it's not exclusively, but it's largely a Southeast and Southwestern U.S. business. So what we would say is this, we think the south, clearly outperformed on the upside. We think the south is going to outperform on the downside. But equally, we think, if things get turned back on, that it will perform quite well. Here's part of what's different in this government-mandated recession versus prior one, Stanley, housing is not overbuilt. So if we look at population trends, and we again, noted that in the prepared remarks, population trends in North Carolina, populations trends in Georgia, Florida, Texas, Colorado, all states in which we have 1 or 2 positions, are very attractive population dynamics.  The other piece of it, Stanley, and this is one that I would ask you and your colleagues who spend time thinking about this to ponder. I think you're likely to see more people pivoting away from urban living and looking more to live in suburbs for a while. I think having some space is going to be something that people will gravitate towards. The other thing, and it pivots modestly away from your housing question, but I think it's relevant. I think as we think about what a Transportation Act is likely to look like in this next generation, I think it's going to be heavier on surface transportation and perhaps lighter on transit because suddenly, the notion of getting in trains or otherwise is going to be something I think people would be cautious of. So again, Stan, I'll try to answer your question very specifically, where were we pre-COVID? Where are we now? What did the percentages look like? Where do we think the comeback will be the quickest and some of the, I guess, color around the why.
Stanley Elliott: That's great. And on the cost side, I mean, look, I don't think it's going to be quite like 2009, but you all did a really nice job of taking the costs out. Could you -- with kind of what you have in place, could you look at SG&A being down on a year-over-year basis? And then also maybe as a reminder, could you tell us how much you all used in terms of diesel gallons last year?
Howard Nye: Yes, certainly can. What I would say is this, look, we're always very sensitive to SG&A. And I think if you look at us compared to most of our peers and you look at our SG&A as a percent of revenue, you're going to be pretty impressed with where that is. What I would tell you is we will absolutely positively adjust that as we feel like we need to. So -- and I think our track record reveals, that's something that we will do. But importantly, Stanley, we'll do it in the right way. With respect to diesel fuel last year, we used right at -- I believe, it was right at 15 million gallons of diesel fuel last year. And for those of you who are wondering, we used a whopping 11.7 million gallons in the first quarter of 2020.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Appreciate it.
Howard Nye: Good to hear your voice.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering, Ward, if you can just talk about, given the difference in the footprint, how we should think about pricing in this downturn compared to the Great Recession? Nice not to have the river system assets, and what we saw in the last cycle which was actually a pricing bottom after volumes did, and I'm wondering, given the change in the footprint. How are you folks managing your business potentially differently in this cycle compared to coming out of the Great Recession?
Howard Nye: Yes. One of the things that I'm sensitive to, Jerry, to your point, is we've got a 1 or 2 position in 90% of our markets today. In the Great recession, we had a 1 or 2 position, 65% of our markets. Okay. So let's take -- let's talk a bit about what critical mass can mean. And I think critical mass and the dimension of your question, is our friend. I think equally, you raised a really good point, and that is we've been very thoughtful about geographic areas that we wanted to exit and geographic areas that we wanted to enter. And what we try to do is enter areas with high relative population growth and multiple economic drivers. So if we go back and take a look at the way our SOAR plan has come together and dictated that we have 1 or 2 positions, it truly has dictated that we have landed where we have. I think the markets where we have these positions, they are far better than they were before.  I equally think from a local land use perspective, the barriers to entry are as high, candidly, probably higher today than they were before. If you think about even during the last several years and what I think most would say has been a relatively good economy in some of these sectors of the United States, you've not seen a great deal of greenfielding. And I think in a down economy, you see even less of that. The other thing that's important to remember, Jerry, is in construction, we're seldom going to be the reason that a contractor is either successful in getting a job or not successful in getting a job. And what I mean by that is this. Stone is about 10% of the cost of building road. It's about 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on a nonresidential project. In other words, we are the product that's utterly essential for that project to go forward because there is no substitute, generally speaking, for what we do. At the same time, we're not going to make or break what's going on relative to the project. I think that's one reason that you saw aggregates do so well in the last downturn. My sense is, for all of those reasons you will see it do, in my view, better as we go through this period of time.
Jerry Revich: And Ward, if we're coming out of those and was the residential pickup happens as you laid out in '21 under that scenario if absolute construction activity bottoms, call it, fourth quarter of '20, first quarter of '21, given the market structure today, when would you expect aggregates pricing to reaccelerate under that scenario that I just laid out?
Howard Nye: I think we will continue to be very consistent all the way through this, at least from a Martin Marietta perspective. Part of what we talked about historically, is -- you're right, it would either go up or the volume upwards slow with the price up would slow with volume. The fact is, Jerry, if you look over the last several years, it's never really worked that way. Actually, pricing, in some respects, has done better overall than volume has done, particularly in places where there's been some reasonable consolidations. So to your point, if we look at what ASPs have done in Colorado, on a percentage basis, they've gone up nicely ahead of aggregate volumes overall. So I think it's going to vary a lot by geographic region. But at the same time, this has proven itself not to behave in a down market as a commodity. So from our perspective, again, recognizing that we're a very small percentage of the overall costs, but we have a product in the ground that's more valuable tomorrow than it is today, we're going to approach pricing with that mindset.
Jerry Revich: So it doesn't sound like you think the 4% pricing in April is an outlier.
Howard Nye: Right. No, not at all.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Paul Roger from Exane BNP Paribas.
Paul Roger: You've talked a bit about the flexibility on the cost side. I wonder if you could talk a bit more on the cash flow side. And in particular, how much scope there might be to reduce working capital? And just linked to that, maybe also as a follow-up. Do you have any concerns on the receivables side?
Howard Nye: If I may, Paul, I'll turn it over to Jim, and he'll take you through those. One of the nice things about -- I'll give you this one bit of color. One of the nice things about being a building material supplier is you either have lean rights on private jobs or you have bond rights on public jobs. So actually, ours is one of those sectors that tends to have more stable and collectible receivables than most. So with that as a preliminary background, let me turn the balance of the question over to Jim.
James Nickolas: Yes, thanks. It's something that we're mindful of and we're watchful of. As a macro matter, I will say, our receivables are backstopping our AR facility. So that is a natural offset. So we get the access to funds almost immediately. So the AR receivable is a great source of funds for us. And that's through our $400 million AR facility. And as far as it relates to bad debt expense or writing off those receivables, it has historically been a very, very, very small, I would call it, insignificant expense for us, averaging around $3 million per year at most. And so that's not something that I'm troubled by. We will, of course, monitor that and take action as needed. But it's a very, very small number, typically. So that's not an issue for us.
Paul Roger: That's very clear. And just maybe as a quick follow-up. When you think more medium term about what is this crisis could do in terms of the structure of the industry? Do you think there's a potential that this puts a bit more pressure on some of the mom-and-pops so some of the smaller aggregate guys? And could it actually create opportunities for you to even potentially accelerate some of your source strategy?
Howard Nye: It certainly could. What I'll tell you is most closely held businesses are probably in a pretty good place going into this downturn. My experience is it's more succession issues that tend to drive those decisions than it is near-term economic issues, but I'm not going to be naive and assume that there are not some people out there who may feel otherwise in that respect. One of the things that you'll see, if you look at our balance sheet is we're right at 2.3x debt to EBITDA. That's very much within the range that we like to stay. Paul, if you go back and take a look at where we were going into the Great Recession and what we look like coming out of the Great Recession, we did utilize that downturn to grow our business very, very responsibly. We continue to say that our best first dollar is in the right acquisition and emphasis on the word right. So we will continue to watch for that. We like to believe that we're going to be a preferred acquirer if businesses should come up. And we will watch that, and we will be very thoughtful about the way that we approach it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet.
Ryan Coyne: This is Ryan on for Mike. Can you just provide an update on funding in Texas, specifically in terms of what levels of oil prices mean for contributions to state transportation funding? And then similarly, what do you expect to occur on asphalt margins as inputs drop? Will pricing follow inputs lower?
Howard Nye: No. Sure. Let me deal with the latter one first. If we go, the only place that we have asphalt is in Colorado, just as a reminder. And one of the great things about being in Colorado is you're not on either one of the coasts. So what it tells you is asphalt and liquid stays relatively steady as you go through it. So if we look at liquid costs as we went through Q1, they were really about $450 a ton. They've recently come closer to about $420 a ton. So we don't think we're going to see big variations in that Colorado market relative to liquid. One of the things that's worth knowing is if we look at our backlog in asphalt and paving, we've got about $100 million more in work year-to-date this year in April than we did in the prior year. So we've got a very attractive paving business in that marketplace, and we've got a cost structure that we think is going to be quite helpful to us as we go there. The other thing that we saw in Q1 is we saw some municipal work accelerated. And it's a practical matter for us, what happens is we bid on municipal work. Oftentimes, we negotiate private work.  So at times, you'll see a modestly lower selling price on the muni work simply because it's bid. So I just wanted to make sure that we talked through that. Back to your other question. Several things relative to TxDOT. If we look back over the last several years, going back to as late as 2017 and look at numbers that were awarded at TxDOT. In 2017, it was $5.1 billion. In 2018, it was $7.6 billion. In 2019, $8.9 billion. We've got a couple of different estimates right now, but the latest estimate I've seen for Texas is around $7.9 billion. So again, if you look at $7.9 billion and you look at what that -- how that racks up relative to history, that's not a bad place to be. The thing to remember on Prop 1 and Prop 7, and I think that was the gravamen of much of your question. Prop 1 allocates portions of oil and gas revenues to the State Highway fund through 2034. Prop 7 is -- really comes into play of sales and tax collections reached $28 billion.  And after that, the next $2.5 billion are transferred to DOT. We're going to have to watch and see how some of the Prop 1 and Prop 7 monies go. I think we haven't seen any big surprises coming from that so far. And that, in part, that's driven by what I had mentioned before, Texas has a $10 billion rainy day fund. And the Texas controller so far has indicated that the state can manage whatever revenue loss they've seen in this first year without having to go and tap in that rainy day fund. But in any event, we know a very robust fund is there. So several things. I'll try to give you what I think is responsive data relative to asphalt, liquid and paving in Colorado, give you a good sense of what total TxDOT current letting should look like over a period of years where those dollars have come from and where we think that is and the backstop of rainy day fund.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke from Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: How do you think about the impact from mix as it relates to both revenue per unit and gross margins across the different construction end markets? Do the decrementals change across different end markets, whether it's infrastructure, commercial or resi?
James Nickolas: No. Not really. There's really -- again, from -- in our perspective, we're relatively agnostic in terms of ASP and profitability. They're pretty consistent.
Seldon Clarke: Okay. And then just getting back to the oil and gas question for a second. Could you just give us a sense of what you think your direct exposure to the oil and gas complex is? And then realize this might be a little bit more difficult but -- to contextualize. But in your internal planning meetings or stress test scenarios, how do you think about your more indirect exposure to the oil and gas industry as well?
Howard Nye: So thanks for the question. Here's the way I would respond to that. I guess several things. One, lower oil actually helps us on diesel pretty considerably. If we go back to the sheer volume of gallons that we burned through a year, 50 million gallons is not a small amount. So it helps us in that dimension. To your point, do we have some energy exposure relative to stone that we have sold to people traditionally in the shale fields? The answer is yes. If we go back and say, okay, what did that look like at absolute peak? At peak back in 2014, we sold 7.5 million tons to different shale producers who needed stone to build pads or internal roads. The absolute bottom of the cycle, we sold 1.4 million. And last year, we were 2.3 million.  And this year, we said we probably thought we'd be somewhere between 2.5 million and 3 million because we thought that was a pretty steady, steady run rate. So I would say that relative to those things. Now with respect to your other question, which is a good one, on the balance of some of nonres, if we think about those really large energy projects, not shale activity, but the shale -- but the large energy projects in South Texas. Here's what I would say. The first wave of those really has gone. There were total awards for about 7.9 million tons of aggregates and about 660,000 cubic yards of concrete. And of those 7.9 million, we won about 3.5 million tons of it. And that's consistent with what we've said. We said we weren't going to get all of that, but we would get our share of it.  And I think we certainly have. If we think about what the rest of this year is likely to look like, I think in 2020, we'll probably ship around 1 million tons during the course of the year to those different projects. And what that means is this, it means Port Arthur LNG, Golden Pass and some other large projects that are still down there on the books will likely be pushed out to the right just a little bit. And as a reminder, that's going to tally up to modestly over 14 million tons of aggregates coming forward in these projects over the course of time. So again, I've tried to address diesel cost and what that energy means to us in our business. I've tried to address what's going on in the shale fields, both at peak, trough last year, what we thought this year would be and when our overall view is on the large energy projects on the Gulf Coast.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: A question on the FAST Act and the expiration in September. And I know there's been a lot said and written about the likelihood of something like this is actually getting done before the election, which seems to be increasingly remote opinion to many. In which case, I guess, we're looking at a continuing resolution situation, just help me, with the continuing resolution, is it possible to get an increase in spending levels under continuing resolution? Or are you kind of locked in at existing levels?
Howard Nye: No. I think the fact is if they agree to it, you could get an increase in. And actually, David, what's been interesting, that's exactly where we thought we were coming into the year. We anticipated that the most likely result in 2020 was to be in continuing resolution land until post-election. I do think it's going to be interesting to see if there's going to be a push to have a successor to the FAST Act before then. Because obviously, it does expire in September. I think the one thing that I would say is this, I think everyone learned from the experience a decade ago that short-term CRs are not good for anybody. They're not good for the government. They're not good for the states. They're not good for the contractors. And they're not good for the material suppliers. So I would say that I'm not sure that we're totally in a place that it's only going to be CRs. I think you might see something more at the Senate level as opposed to the House level, but they clearly -- if they wanted to take it up, they could.
David MacGregor: Okay. And then also earlier in your comments on the call, you made reference to bidding activity in the second half of the year, and you thought that people would be looking at that a lot differently. Obviously, given the macro, I guess -- guess what you meant by that. But can you go back and elaborate on that a little further in terms of just how you see bidding activity unfolding over the balance of the year?
Howard Nye: Well, I think we're -- our comments more geared toward private activity and what may or may not happen then. And I think much of it, David, is going to be dictated by how quickly we come out of some of these stay-at-home orders and how the economy, frankly, reacts to several things. I think that's going to be your driver. I think the light portion of nonres has historically proven itself to be the place that people can either turn on or turn off with greater precision than others. I think homebuilding, the same thing can be said there. If you look at what homebuilders have done, even during the last several weeks, many of them hit pause for a period of time. I think we certainly feel like they're going to come back and resume. But again, I think what we're trying to outline, David, is none of us have ever done this before. This is going to be a little bit different. The things that I think are going to be constant is, I think we're going to do really well on pricing. I think we're going to do really well on costs. I think we're going to get our share of business. I think the question is going to be exactly what will business on the private side look like. And I think if anybody can tell us that, that's somebody we'd all like to have on their payroll.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America.
Timna Tanners: Ward, I really wanted your perspective on kind of the 3 different components of potential government support. So I know there was some discussion on FAST Act and continued resolution versus the replacement. But also you mentioned that AASHTO nearly $50 billion request. And there's, of course, never-ending waiting for the infrastructure stimulus potential. So if you look at those 3 different categories, can you comment on the probability that you see of each? And when it would affect your markets?
Howard Nye: Yes. I guess what I would say is this. I'm increasingly wondering if the phase on aggregate just ends up being the new highway bill. And that's one reason that we're wondering if they don't go ahead and accelerate. And rather than having CRs this year on the FAST Act, we might see a new highway bill. And by the way, we would be perfectly fine with that. I think that's a good, steady undertaking. I think the one that I would watch here near term will be how that $50 billion is received because I do think there's going to be increasing pressure from state DOTs on their members of Congress and Senate members to shore up some revenue shortfalls and state DOTs are going to have. Timna, if we go back over the last decade, what you're clearly seeing, and you've got great work on it is, it's been the state DOTs that have really filled the hole over the last decade. The federal government has not -- and I think there's going to be a real need for the federal government to help offset that in the downturn. So near term, I will watch more closely on AASHTO or the AASHTO-like request, and I'll be more focused on the emphasis of having a ready to go highway bill behind the FAST Act.
Timna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up was on the AASHTO request. They point to that potential 30% decline in state revenues for DOTs over the next 18 months. But is that a Martin number? Or is that their number? And would you think that, that would translate to your specific states?
Howard Nye: That's their number. And I think it varies considerably by state. And actually, Timna, ARPA has a really good chart that can take you on a state-by-state journey, if you're so inclined on what federal funds, what state funds look like and then how state funds roll into it. So different states, for example, will deal differently with gas tax or vehicle transfer fees or others. And then equally, depending on what the source of the funds are, dictates how much of a trust fund you may have around some of those dollars.
Operator: Our last question comes from Rohit Seth from SunTrust.
Rohit Seth: Building on the last couple of questions. If we didn't get a full $50 billion bill out, something somewhat less than that, and all the money goes into the DOT fund. And you get a continuing resolution with the FAST Act. And given what you have in your backlog, because it gets a little bit more complicated than just looking at those 2 metrics. But is there a potential for growth in the infrastructure end market in 2021 in those circumstances?
Howard Nye: I think there could be in some stage, Rohit. I mean I don't think you can dismiss that. And again, part of what I was outlining, and I think it was in part going back to Jerry's question, he was talking about the difference in the markets that we operate in today versus where we were a decade ago. If you look at this, the fiscal condition of states today, most of the states, aside from some of these very discrete COVID issues, are in very good conditions, particularly with rainy day funds. We talked about a big rainy day fund in Texas. There's a big rainy day fund in North Carolina as well. So I think what's happening with a lot of states, in fairness, they're waiting to see what comes out of Washington. And then they're going to make their own state-by-state decisions on what they need to do. What I would tell you is if you go to each one of these large states in which we have a significant presence, they all tend to view infrastructure as a critical priority. And they view it as a critical priority because their population trends are such that if they don't stay ahead of that, they're going to be in a really difficult place. And by the way, that's a high-class problem, not a bad problem. So short answer is, yes. I think you could see degrees of growth. I don't think you would necessarily see it everywhere under that scenario. But I think you could see it. Yes, Rohit.
Rohit Seth: Okay. And then it's five years since the FAST Act. And when we look back at kind of how that played out, the states have raised their money funding as well. If we did get a new highway bill, what do you think changed in terms of how quickly that money can be put to work, what projects are out there in the marketplace? And just your thoughts on what the highway bill will look like?
Howard Nye: Yes. Here's what's different. If you think about what happened last time, Rohit, they had -- at state DOTs, that had significant layoffs. So they went -- they came into the recovery without a lot of engineering and design professionals. So the fact is they weren't in a position to put jobs out to bid and award and give notices to proceed. I think that's fundamentally different today. I think when we go back and think about that statement I gave you just a few minutes ago relative to Colorado, when I said we won $100 million more in work year-to-date in April '20 than we did in the prior year. I think that's actually pretty good evidence of where DOT sit today. You can also go and look and see how different DOTs have dealt with it over the last decade.  Texas DOT, frankly, has just hired a lot of people. North Carolina DOT has outsourced a lot of that design work to very specific engineering firms across the state. And they put themselves in a position that their delivery rate could actually be very attractive. And oddly enough, that's one of the things state is sorting through right now because they were able to get projects out much more quickly frankly than they thought they would. So again, if you look structurally at how DOTs are set today versus where they were a decade ago, it's very different. And I think from contractor or material supplier perspective, it's an advantage to the industry.
Rohit Seth: Okay. And then last question on M&A. I know last quarter, it sounded like the pipeline was heating up a bit, but the world has further changed. I mean maybe comment on what the deal flow looks like out there? Are you -- do you still have an appetite to do maybe a sizable deal? Or are you going to be a little bit more conservative in near term?
Howard Nye: I guess a couple of things, Rohit. Number one, I think if you go back and look at the deals that we've done, I think you can look at the history on them, and you'll be pleased with what we've done. Because -- and I think that's in large part because we've been thoughtful about what, and we've been thoughtful about when, and we've been thoughtful about size. So I'm going to give you the answer you would expect, and I'm going to say it all entirely depends. I mean there could be some deals that would come along that would be so impactful to us. That if you were looking over our shoulder at a model, you would say, good heavens, go and do that. And there are going to be others that we will likely be more cautious with. And frankly, you would urge that as well. Part of what I spoke of in the comments is we have an experienced management team, and this is not our first rodeo. And it's not going to be our first rodeo of looking at deals in a market that might be different. So we will look at them. We want to grow our business. We want to grow it responsibly. We also understand the value of a fortress balance sheet. And that's what we have today. And what we want to make sure we can do, Rohit, said the best of all worlds. And I think we've got a path to do it.
Rohit Seth: But you're going to maintain that investment grade at all costs, is that right?
Howard Nye: We've certainly said it's important to us. I'm not sure we've ever said at all costs, but it certainly is important to us.
Rohit Seth: All right. All right. That's all I want to know.
Howard Nye: All right, Rohit. All right. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has the right strategies, the right priorities and the right team to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move this company forward. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2020 results in a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. 
Howard Nye: Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-11 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's call, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, 2019 supplemental information, that summarizes our financial results and trends. As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the full year 2019, any comparisons are versus the prior year. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Howard Nye, who initially will discuss our full year operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our 2019 financial results after which Howard will discuss market trends and 2020 expectations. A question-and-answer session will follow. I will now turn the call over to Howard.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta marked 25 years as a public company in 2019. Throughout our history we positioned our business to outperform through the disciplined execution of a proven strategy and our team shared commitment to the world-class attributes of our business including safety, ethics, cost discipline and operational excellence. Today's reported results clearly validate the importance of these strategic priorities. As Suzanne noted today's discussion will appropriately focus on full-year results. However, as you read in our earnings release, we reported a much improved year-over-year fourth quarter that kept off a 12-month period of record-setting financial performance. In 2019 we once again established new records for revenues, profits and adjusted EBITDA from improved shipments, pricing and cost management across most of our building materials business. For the year consolidated total revenues increased 12% to $4.7 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 22% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation depletion and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to nearly $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $9.74 a 31% improvement. Our 2019 results marked the eighth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. Martin Marietta's ability to repeatedly translate revenue growth into increased profitability has been and continues to be a differentiator. Our strong earnings growth drove a total shareholder return of 64% in 2019 more than double the S&P 500 and strong outperformance relative to most of our sector. For those who have long followed Martin Marietta, our passion is operating our business safely. Safety is the core principle and the foundation of our strong financial performance. We're proud to have achieved world-class lost time instant rate levels company-wide for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we've meaningfully improved safety performance at our legacy Bluegrass Materials operations acquired in 2018; our company's second largest acquisition. From the boardroom to site operations our teams have embraced our guardian angel and wingman branded safety culture. This continued commitment has elevated safety awareness across the company reducing downtime from workplace incidents and leading to higher revenues and profitability. Most importantly working safely protects our employees and the more than 400 communities in which we live and work. Now let's take a deeper dive into the full-year operating performance for each of our product offerings. Aggregate shipments increased at 12% to 191 million tons exceeding our original 2019 guidance for volume growth of 6% to 8%. These shipment levels benefited from solid underlying product demand together with carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. Notably for the first time in four years aggregate shipments to all three primary induced markets increased reflecting improved strength in public and private sector spending in our markets. Aggregate pricing improved 4% in line with our expectations. Importantly all divisions contributed to this solid growth. A testament to the strength of our markets and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. We expect these dynamics combined with recent positive industry trends to support ongoing pricing momentum. Our cement operations established new four-year records for volumes and gross profits. Shipments increased 10% to nearly 3.9 million tons driven by robust Texas demand, 2018 weather deferred projects and an expanded distribution terminal footprint. Cement pricing improved 3% consistent with our expectations. We expect our cement operations will continue to benefit from tight supply and healthy demand in Texas supported by growing customer backlogs and our April 2020 price increases. Now turning to our downstream businesses despite solid fourth quarter volume improvement our full-year ready mix concrete shipments decreased 2%. Our Southwest and Rocky Mountain divisions were unable to completely overcome weather challenges that intermittently hindered construction activities throughout the year. Average selling price increased modestly with solid gains in Colorado partly offset by a strategic customer segmentation that limited pricing improvements in Texas. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business enjoyed strong customer backlogs; a notable portion of which had been deferred into 2020. That said shipments and pricing improves 7.5% and nearly 4% respectively. And I'll turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full-year financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you Howard. The building materials business achieved record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion a 12% increase and record product gross profit of $1.1 billion a 26% increase. Full year aggregates product gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.3% driven by pricing gains and improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels. We also benefited from the actions of the negative impact from selling acquired inventory or written by acquisition accounting in 2018 as part of the Bluegrass transaction. However, following months of robust shipment levels we incurred higher late year costs for contract services, repairs and supplies to better prepare ourselves for future production needs. These costs negatively impacted our incremental margin as did the disproportionately strong growth in long-haul distribution revenues which have a lower margin and local or truck served [quarry] revenues. While our revenues grew at roughly double the rate of quarry revenues I'm pleased to report that gross profit per ton increased for both the long-haul and local quarry operations. Our cement operations established all-time records for product revenues and gross profit. Product revenues increased 13% to $439 million driven by volume and pricing growth. Notably, gross profit increased 14% to $143 million even after accelerating $6 million of planned maintenance outage activities at our Hunters cement plant during the fourth quarter 2019. Revenue growth coupled with production efficiencies from increased shipment and production levels more than offset the higher maintenance costs as product gross margin improved 20 basis points to 32.7%. Product revenues for the ready mix concrete business decreased less than 2%. Despite lower revenues gross margin expanded 60 basis points reflecting the benefits of our 2018 restructuring of the company's Southwest ready mix concrete business. Magnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 7% to $250 million as chemicals and lime customers reduced inventory levels to line with a slowing demand trends experienced during the back half of the year. Our lime business was negatively impacted by the General Motors work stoppages in September and October as steel manufacturers pull back on demand the fluxing agent products we provide. We anticipate these current trends to be short-term in nature. Impressively, product gross margin actually improved 150 basis points to 39.8% as the business pro-actively responded with effective cost control measures. We ended 2019 with a strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $966 million increased 37% over 2018 driven by double-digit earnings growth and lower contributions to our already well-funded qualified defined benefit pension plan. Martin Marietta continues to balance its long-standing discipline capital allocation priorities to further enhance shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility. Our priorities remain value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases all while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. In 2019, we deployed $394 million of capital into our business and returned $228 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the repurchase of 416,000 shares of our common stock. Since the announcement our share repurchase program in February 2015 we've returned more than $1.6 billion to shareholders while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. We also reduced debt by $350 million in 2019. Strong earnings growth and higher debt repayments allowed the company to return as we said we would to our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times. With that I will turn the call back to Howard to discuss our 2020 outlook.
Howard Nye: Thanks Jim. We are excited to build on our momentum 2020 and beyond by capitalizing on attractive fundamentals that support sustainable and long term construction growth. This underscores the importance of the notion we have long articulated where [you are] matters. We have thoughtfully executed on our strategic analysis and operating review known internally as [SOR] to position our business through aggregate/expansion in high growth mega regions. These mega regions exhibit attractive market fundamentals including population growth, business and employment diversity and superior state fiscal position. Notably, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida will account for nearly half of our nation's population growth between now and 2040. That's a staggering statistics in four of our top ten states by revenue. These states are experiencing and will likely continue to experience a significant influx of people requiring homes, schools, offices, restaurants, and roads. In short, population growth would drive increased construction, heavy side building materials in key Martin Marietta served markets for the next two decades. With that in mind we are confident that construction activity in our top ten states will continue to outpace growth nationwide. The combination of strong infrastructure funding levels and healthy private sector activity is expected to drive both increased shipments and better pricing resulting in record profitability for our company in 2020. The infrastructure market is our most aggregate-intensive venues but represented only 35% of our aggregate shipments in 2019 well below the company's most recent 10 year average of 45%. In 2020 we anticipate infrastructure shipments to meaningfully grow driven by lettings and contract awards in our key geographies, strong state and federal funding levels and proposed regulatory reforms that if approved will reduce the permitting burden of large transportation projects. States continue to play an expanded role in infrastructure investment which bodes well for Martin Marietta as we have intentionally positioned our business in states with superior departmental transportation programs. In Texas our largest state by revenues the DOT expects nearly $22 billion of construction contracts to fiscal year 2021 as part of its 10 year $77 billion unified transportation program. Construction growth in Texas will benefit further from large scale design build projects in and around Dallas, Fort Worth. North Carolina the third largest state by revenues has an attractive overall fiscal position. In fact, the state's treasury is very well funded in 2020 as tax collections continue to exceed projections. That said we anticipate modest but transitory headwinds in road maintaining spending due the first half of 2020 as North Carolina DOT works through some temporary cash flow issues. More broadly we expect incremental funding at the state and local levels to continue expanding at fast and near term rates than federal funding which will lead to additional growth opportunities for our company. Voters approved 89% of state and local transportation initiatives of the November 2019 ballot providing nearly $10 billion of targeted transportation funding across the nation. Of this total 80% was approved for transportation initiatives in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina and Georgia. Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure remains a national strategic priority. When the [indiscernible] enjoyed by partition support in Washington. We expected an enactment of a comprehensive federal infrastructure package to our place for fixing America's Service Transportation Act or FAST Act will drive multi-year infrastructure growth. Notable progress is being made on this front. In July 2019 The Senate Environment and Public Works issued America's Transportation Infrastructure Act, a Draft Highway Authorization Bill. The draft proposes $287 billion in Federal Highway Funding over the next five years, a 28% increase over previous authorizations funding levels. Also in late January the house committee on transportation and infrastructure unveiled the moving forward framework which includes $390 billion over five years for federal highway spending, a 41% increase. The president had last week stated the union address endorsed the Senate's Bill urging Congress to pass infrastructure legislation. Legislative emphasis will now turn towards assuring a sustainable funding mechanism and we're optimistic one will ultimately be agreed upon. Nonetheless, we're entering 2020 with perspective that a successor bill is unlikely to be passed before the November 2020 election. However, we fully expect congressional continuing resolutions to maintain federal transportation funding at a minimum at status quo levels for any interim period following the FAST Act September 2020 expiration. We're confident that states have the necessary visibility and resources to advance planned and future construction projects particularly in our key states which tend to be less dependent on federal support for highway projects. Non-residential shipments which accounted for 36% of our 2019 aggregate shipments are at higher levels on a percentage basis than we have historically experienced. Nonetheless, we expect another year of healthy commercial activity in 2020 supported by projects for data centers, warehouses, distribution centers and corporate relocations. Remember we have purposefully positioned our business along major interstate growth orders where land is readily available for the construction of these fulfillment and data centers. Additionally, the recent upward movements in the architectural buildings and dodge momentum indices support a sustainable commercial construction outlook. Within the industrial sector heavy building materials consumption should benefit from the incoming wave of large energy sector projects over the next several years particularly along the Texas Gulf Coast. Construction activity on 4 projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2020 and continue for several years thereafter. Martin Marietta is well-positioned to supply the aggregates, cement and readiness concrete needs for these multi-year energy projects. Residential construction represented 22% of our 2019 aggregate shipments while this end use is outperformed relative to the overall construction market. We expect continued gains across our leading southeastern and southwestern geographic footprint. Permit growth which in our view is the best indicator of future housing construction activity for Martin Marietta continues to be solid for single-family and multi-family housing units in our top 10 states. Keep in mind multifamily construction generally begins early in an economic cycle and then transitions to more aggregates intensive single-family construction. Healthy multifamily bodes well for continued residential growth across our footprint. Even more compelling as previously mentioned Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida four of our top 10 states will account for nearly 50% of the country's total population growth over the next two decades as people migrate to areas with attractive employment opportunities, land availability and overall business and tax friendly environments. Importantly, notable population growth drives increased housing demand which also supports future non-residential and infrastructure activity. In summary, we expect aggregate shipments to increase 2% to 4% in 2020 reflecting growth in all three primary construction end uses and notable upside in the infrastructure market. From a cadence perspective shipment growth is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year given a strong first half comparison and transient North Carolina DOT headlines. Annual price increases which become effective from January 1 to April 1 have already garnered market support most importantly in Texas, the Carolinas and Southeast. To that end we expect aggregates pricing to increase in range of 4% to 6%. Combined with contributions from our cement downstream at magnesia specialties businesses on a consolidated basis we expect total revenues of $4.875 billion to $5.075 billion and EBITDA of $1.348 billion to $1.453 billion. To conclude we're proud of our 2019 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We are equally optimistic about the future of Martin Marietta. As we move forward Martin Marietta remains committed to positioning our business to be aggregates led in high-growth geographies and aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. We will continue to be disciplined in our solid strategic plan and our team's commitment to the world-class attributes of our business, safety, ethics, cost discipline and operational excellence. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in 2020 and further strengthening our foundation for long-term success. If the operator will now provide the required instructions we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning. 
Howard Nye: Hi Trey.
Trey Grooms: So first off thanks for all the detail that you gave us around the 2020 guide and you guys are obviously facing a more difficult volume comp and as you look at your volume assumption of kind of up 2% to 4%, I know you mentioned shipments might be towards the second half of the year there but more specifically what are you seeing in your backlogs or what are you hearing from your customers that give you confidence in that 2% to 4% range despite the pretty tough comps you guys are facing.
Howard Nye: No, Trey that's a great question. Thank you for that. I mean here's the quick tale of the tape. I mean if we go down I can tell you mid-Atlantic backlogs for our customers are up. If we look at Midwest that just had a killer year last year from a volume perspective [they also] flat. If we look at Mideast they're up. Southwest is up. Cement is up and Rocky Mountain is up. I mean the Rocky is really it was interesting trade because they had a 2019 that felt like 2018 did I think for much of the industry from a weather perspective. So as we're looking across our footprint and looking at most of our divisions what I'll tell you is their backlogs and speaking to their customers actually look it's good or better going into ‘20 than they did going into ‘19 and to your point that's the primary driver that gives us the confidence in the volume prediction that we put out so far today. We feel very comfortable with that.
Trey Grooms: Got you. Thank you. And I guess for my follow-up the infrastructure in market in the 4Q was down slightly you noted in the press release and I know there can be some delays and things like that and we're aware of the short-term situation going on in North Carolina but can you go into more detail about the public side? What you saw in the quarter and is that something that gives you any concern at all as you look into ‘20?
Howard Nye: Actually Trey, does not. What I would say is there were primarily two issues that I would call out. Clearly there were some permitting delays in Georgia that slowed down two projects. Those are resolved and really you had some weather issues that drove some activity or lack of activity in Colorado. If we pause and look at it more broadly here's what I'll tell you if you look in Texas you're looking at letting schedule of $7.7 billion which is very much in their sweet spot. I think they'll be very good with that. What's striking is if you look forward to 2021 it's a $14.1 billion placeholder right now. So those are huge dollars for this year and going into next because you'll see even more design-build. Keep in mind we're going to start to benefit from the major mobility program in Georgia as well. They're going to come out with $12 billion of new projects to reduce congestion primarily around the Atlanta metro area where in a post Bluegrass World we have a much more significant footprint. Even North Carolina the fact is the state is in very, very good condition. If we look overall at the lettings that they've had over the last several years they put essentially in a very attractive place particularly in Eastern North Carolina. I think the only thing that may happen for a period of months is we may see modestly less maintenance spend but equally if we look at Colorado DOT and again hitting these really hit our top leading states from an infrastructure perspective the surface treatment budget is up significantly. It's up 84 million to 303 million and the capital destruction budget remains steady to last year when they were actually hit with pretty notable weather circumstances. So if we look at our states by revenue in number one Texas, it looks really good. Number two, Colorado it looks really good. North Carolina looks strong actually. We're going to have some delays early. Georgia looks good and Florida continues to have a budget in the $10 billion range. Again when we're looking at numbers like that on the public side and we see what we think is coming it gives us a lot of conviction around that biggest single part of our business trend
Trey Grooms: Okay, that’s encouraging. I'll pass it on and thanks for taking my questions Howard.
Howard Nye: You bet. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First on pricing, if you could just give thoughts on prints and pricing and in more particular how do you feel going into 2020 in terms of how the landscape setup and how is this relative to last year. And if you could really look at it in terms of product line, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Yes, sure Kathryn. A couple of things. One, pricing in the quarter actually looked quite good; it was sub over 5%. Now as Jim mentioned in his portion of the prepared comments, some of that was driven by the fact that we simply had more long-haul in the quarter. Our rail business was actually up considerably. If you normalize volume, pricing would have been up a little bit over 4% for the quarter, which again is very much in keeping with where we thought. And again, I think you can look at Q4 from a volume and pricing perspective and get some kind of play on how things are going to be as we start going into 2020. I think we're seeing a better price environment in aggregates than we've seen for a while across our entire footprint. I know we're seeing a better pricing environment in cement than we've seen since we've owned those assets in Texas. So, if we're looking at that pricing environment in particular, Kathryn, you may recall that we had announced an $8 a ton price increase effective April 1. It looks like most of the rest of the market is there. There is one player that's actually come in as we understand it with the letter that has it at $9.50 a ton. So again, we feel very good about where that is. Equally, if we look at the downstream businesses, I think we'll continue to see price increases for ready mixed concrete in the range of $6 to $8 per cubic yard. That's probably not a bad bogey if you to keep in mind in both Colorado and Texas right now. And keep in mind, part of what we called them in our prepared commentary is we had some segment changes modestly in concrete that actually gave us some optical headwind on pricing because we've made more of a play in Texas in particular to the housing market because we think that's actually more resilient to weather. So, as you recall coming into '19, we had said we were planning for a wetter than usual year and that dictated some degree of the shift that we had in the way that we were lining up end users as well. I hope that's response to your question?
Kathryn Thompson: Yes, it's very helpful. Then my second question really ties in the current quarter with your outlook. The current quarter is really with the puts and takes for the margin drag, where the aggregates segments and help us understanding more with one-time in nature versus ongoing and kind of tag into that really into 2020 outlook as you mentioned a long-haul volumes in the quarter or it impacts stripping costs for Colorado impact or but --.
Howard Nye: Yes.
Kathryn Thompson: In terms of the long-haul volumes, how do we think about that cadence going forward, in other words this is more to say unique events in Q4 or is it something to expect in 2020 and really kind of pulling it all together help us understand kind of that aggregates backwards and then what it means going forward?
Howard Nye: Sure. I'll do my best with that, that's a lot. Kathryn, here's what I would say. When I was speaking to Q4 of saying look at that as a prelude, I was really talking more about pricing and more about volume in that context.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay.
Howard Nye: So, here's what I would say with respect to the quarter itself, there were some very specific one-offs in the quarter that I think you need to keep in mind. One, we did have some catch up on grating and Jim referenced that. So, let's call that $7.5 million -- $8 million. We actually did bring some maintenance at our Hunter cement kiln forward during the quarter because part of what we're aiming for and what we feel like this' going to be a very good year in summit. Yes, it's a higher degree of efficiency and we feel like we positioned ourselves in Q4 for that. With respect to the Rocky Mountains, we had one capital project in Wyoming and we're basically putting a new plant and at Granite Canyon because that's going to help us feed the Northern Colorado market long-term into sales yards as we see aggregate push in place for the industry occurring Northern Colorado. That project finished several months later than we had planned. So between that which is now finished. But between that project finishing later and weather being considerably different in Q4 in Colorado that helped drive part of the difference that we see there, just to give you some metrics around that I think this is important for the quarter. If we're looking at Colorado, Iowa, and asphalt and paving had 57% more weather impacted days in Q4 and by the way that had 30% more full-year impacted days. So, it gives you much clear visibility into 2020. And in the last piece that I would call out is what we mentioned in the South East, we had those two delays on projects on Public Works in and around Atlanta. And then as you recall when Hurricane Dorian stopped over the Bahamas last year, we have an operation as you may recall in Freeport and we were unable to take one boatload of stone out of Freeport that we otherwise would have been Q4. So, really if you look at the catch-up on grading, the item on summit that I mentioned issues related to Rocky Mountain in weather and that capital project that's now been resolved. And those two issues in the South East, that's you bridge in Q4. So, as we look at the way Q4 lined up from that perspective. Now, to the other part of your question, I think was really relative to the margins. And what I'll say in that regard is that if we look at what happened in the quarter relative to rail volumes, the increased 20% -- now remember, I view that as good in more ways than not. I like the fact that we're seeing the rail yards in that expanded network, see the volume go through. But as you'll also recall the margins that we get at the rail yards are not as attractive as the margins we get at truck served quarries. So, you had a modest mix impact on that and that was really the driver on what you saw on a change in margin. Now, as we think about but instead look like going into 2020 and I think that was the last piece of your question. We're anticipating we're going to see really in 2020 about the same degree of long-haul shipments that we saw in 2019. And to give you a sense of it, and that was probably up over 4 million tons on long-haul in 2019. So again, we're looking for what we feel like is going to be an attractive 2019 but we don’t think we're going to see that type of shift relative to the other mix. Kathryn, tell me if I hit the issues that you wanted me to address?
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. And really, kind of the point is, is this kind of a one-time or and how should we think about the cadence going forward. So, I -- that did answer my question. Thank you, very much.
Howard Nye: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phil Ng: Hey guys.
Howard Nye: Hi, Phil.
Phil Ng: Morning. Is there a good way to think about impact on volumes in your aggregates business to start the year, with that short-term dynamic you called out in North Carolina? And embedded in your full-year guide, how do you thinking about whether this year and any other borrow in next-cycle, labor and transportation?
Howard Nye: No. what I would say Phil is this. We're again in getting wetter than usual year and that's what we did last year as well. So, we're taking the same approach to weather saying let's plan for to be wetter weather. So, that's what you see in those numbers. And I think with respect to North Carolina, as we said in the prepared remarks, we view that as wholly transitory, I think you might see some issues but I think they're going to be modest in the first-half of the year. It may be somewhere in the 0.5 million tons to a 1 million tons all in worst case scenario, Phil if you're trying to look at it that way. But my guess is we're going to see that made up and some private work in the States, so it's something that we wanted to make sure we spoke up but it's not something that we're seeing as disruptive to the overall business. I think importantly on the last part of your question and that was relative to what we see going on with contractors, supply chain, et cetera. I think trucking has clearly gotten better over the last couple of years. I think contractors could still use more labor than they entirely have. So, as you think contract labor served as a little bit of a governor on what growth was in 2019. I think I'd be foolish to say it wouldn’t be some modest governor going into '20. But I do think labor has gotten better over time. And in part going back to the commentary that we offered last year and that was consistent with the notion that contractors were willing to pay more to get the labor because they see an emerging public side word coming and the penalties for not completing public work in a timely manner tend to be pretty notable. So, I don’t think you can entirely dismiss it, I think there are issues, I think their issues going to getting better. Did that answers, Phil?
Phil Ng: Yes, that's really helpful. And then award, I think you guys have done an excellent job kind of highlighting your backlogs. For the public side, that and the public builders have obviously reported pretty strong orders, double digit increases. Just curious, have you seen that uptick in your business and what's the typical lag from orders that starts onto your demand?
Howard Nye: It can vary a lot depending on the jobs. Because you can certainly get orders and then on occasion just as we saw in North Georgia, you can see some permitting that delays that may tie into environmental or other issues. So, it can be anywhere from two months to six months fill in and again there can be some noise around both of those. But I do think what we're seeing relative to public is a much healthier '20 than we've seen over the last several years.
Phil Ng: Okay, that's helpful. And just one last one from me, Howard, I couldn't help appreciate on the commentary you said about Texas and it sound like you're feeling a lot more upbeat about the pricing environment. What's embedded in your guidance in any early green shoots to read on the competitive landscape and how guys are behaving in that market. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Hey, you're welcome. Look from what we can tell, obviously we've come out with our price increase letter that was $8 effective April 20. From what we hear from our customers in the marketplace that I think most others have come out with prices that stand like there in that same range. I think there is one that has come out with a letter that's even in excess of that. But that's certainly what we're looking at and it's something that going into the year we've got nice conviction around there.
Phil Ng: Okay, thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Anthony Pettinari: Good morning.
Howard Nye: Good morning Anthony, welcome to the call; we're delighted to have you.
Anthony Pettinari: Thank you, Howard. Thank you. Just following-up on Phil's question on cement. Volumes were up double digits for another quarter and I think you just talked about pricing expectations or the pricing opportunity. With regards to volume expectations, I think you referenced cement being up, is it possible that we could see another strong quarter in 1Q for volumes that maybe comparable to what we saw in 4Q and 3Q?
Howard Nye: One think I try to stay away from is talking too much about the quarter that were in the middle of because if we ever talk about a one quarter and it was great, then we don’t talk about the next you're almost indicating one way or the other. But I'll say is that I think everything that we see in Dallas and Fort Worth and in San Antonio and keep in mind that's where two cement plants are -- is a very healthy marketplace. We talked a little bit early in the call of what the key budgets look like there. At the same time if we come back and take a look at what residential looks like at that marketplace. I mean it's really very, very attractive; Texas and Florida continue to be for example in the top 10 for total permits. DFW has been leading in the nation for a while in single-family and in multi-family. And what you wouldn’t expect is to still see multi-family so strong this deep into a recovery which tells us what we long San Antonio and that is this is really not been a building and let recovery at. So, I think is we're looking at our cement business. We think it's going to be very busy this year and we think Texas is going to be a great place to be from a volume perspective and a profit perspective. The one thing I would say to you is we're going to be particularly focused this year on enhancing our efficiencies. If we can get efficiency levels at the levels that we believe are perfectly attainable at both Midlothian and Hunter and we can have a very special year in cement this year.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Howard, I was wondering if you could talk maybe broadly about how the M&A landscape looks here especially in aggregates in some of these higher growth states that you're targeting, I guess it's almost been two years since full graphs and you leveraged quite successfully here?
Howard Nye: Yes, we have. We brought that leverage down very quickly. And as Jim said as we said we would. Look, we're involved in a steady diet of conversations on M&A and part of what we're doing is as you've heard us say before, we're in aggregate slow business and that is what is going to drive our ability to grow the business the way that we would like to going forward. And I also believe that two things. One, we have a very healthy balance sheet, number two we've got regulatory capacity I think in attractive markets today that others don’t. What that means is you can expect us on the right deal to make sure that we get the right deals, at the same time you should expect us to be very disciplined around transactions that from a marginal order perspective don’t fit what we want to do. And I think if you go back and take a look at what we did with TXI, what we did with Blue Grass and what we've done with some of the tuck-in transactions we've done in Colorado in the aftermath of our river for the Rocky's transaction. That is an area in which we are very disciplined but I would tell you very, very busy right now.
Anthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Anthony.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich: Hi yes, hi good morning everyone.
Howard Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about your demand expectations for core reserve markets versus real serve markets versus real serve markets for ‘20? Should we be looking for them makes dynamic that we saw play out in the fourth quarter continuing at least on a year-over-year basis through part of ‘20?
Howard Nye: Jerry, I think what we anticipated is what we saw for the full year on rail should remain relatively static. So again there was disproportionate growth on the rail side in ‘19. We think we'll see that pretty steady in ‘20 and we think we'll see more coming out of the truck serves. So if you recall Jerry coming into ‘19 we had actually said we thought you'd see incremental margins in the aggregates business of around 55% but we did not anticipate as strong a rail yard year as we did which brought that down just modestly. If you take a look at what incrementals look like for the aggregates business going into ‘20 you'll see that we're planning for that 60% number as opposed to the 55% that we planned for last year. So I think the dialogue around really thinking more or less flat rail ‘19 and the ‘20 and then also going back and giving you that snapshot of where we were on incrementals last year and where we are this year I think that answers your question.
Jerry Revich: It does, yes and to your point earlier on the call look very good volume year overall. It looks like there if some puts and takes around the volumes as you would expect in ‘20 compared to generally robust across more demand in ‘19. From your experience on the pricing cycle how should we think about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year especially considering it sounds like there's going to be a different cadence to demand this year by market compared to what we saw in ‘19.
Howard Nye: I think we've seen the price increases going in the way that we thought that they would Jerry and that is -- they've been going in anywhere from January 1 to April 1 and my guess is there's not going to be anything particularly striking in a difference relative to pricing other than that I think it's going to be modestly stronger in ‘20 than it was in ‘19 because that's usually what healthy volumes do for you. So I wouldn't call out any particular difference relative to cadence.
Jerry Revich: And sorry just a clarification, so you obviously made announcements of January and April price increases. What about the level of mid-year price increase that's embedded at the midpoint of guidance? Can you just give us a bit of context of how much work remains to be done over the balance of the year to get to the midpoint?
Howard Nye: We have not baked in any midyears into that Jerry. So really what we've done in the guidance is anticipated a wetter than usual year. We've anticipated that the pricing is what the pricing is and then mid years come along that would add some momentum to that and keep in mind Jerry one thing to remember even if you do get mid years you're only going to recognize about 25% of a mid-year during the year in which you put the mid year because you still had to work off some backlog and other commitments before it really fully comes into play. So midyears help you a degree in the year in which you put them in. They actually end up being more of your friend in the following year.
Jerry Revich: Perfect. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Brent Thielman: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Question on the Magnesia Specialties business, a little more pressure here in the fourth quarter. It looks like your outlook suggests that might level off here to some degree. Just curious kind of what you're seeing and hearing from customers there that give you some confidence around that?
Brent Thielman: Thanks for the question Brent because that's a business that is such a good business and they just never get the airtime that they deserve but they were faced with two things last year. One Jim mentioned in his comments that there was a slow density of particular around the GM facility and then we saw some customers just rationalizing inventories on the chemical side. As you would imagine we stay very close with those customers. I think we feel like marginally they would have worked through those issues particularly by the time we get towards the end of the first quarter. So if you look at that business I think we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we have that there right now. Part of that I was really taken with though is if you look at that business and you say look the revenues went down, your gross profit went down as well but on a percentage basis did you go down as much as the revenues and then if you look at the margin what you'll actually see last year is the margin went up. So I think that's just indicative of how well they’ve run that business and how accurately they can forecast where the business is going when they need to. So again if we look directly to the dialog with our customers I think that's what gives us the confidence that it's going to end where we said.
Brent Thielman: Okay. Appreciate that and then Howard just because it's in the release you talked a bit about it but any other details or kind of broader parameters we can speak our sink our teeth into kind of around that [floor] 2025 you're obviously in this really enviable capital deployment position. You talk about kind of lessons learned over the last decade. Can you share what you have learnt from that and what might change kind of as you move for the next five years?
Howard Nye: Yes, what I would say in many respects is it worked pretty well. So there are a lot of aspects of that that we would not change as opposed to things that we would change. What we believe, we believe this business is an aggregates led business and we think it's aggregates led for all the right reasons. We think really being focused on geographies with high population growth or either consuming significant aggregates is where we want to be. The notion that we've moved the business from one or two and 65% of our markets to one or two and 90% of our markets over a decade is a pretty heavy statistic when you think about a big heavy slow-moving industry and the ability to always remain profitable and never cut a dividend, these are things to us that are so fundamental to who we are and what I would tell you is you should continue to look for us to do the types of things that we did when we exited the [report] and we went into Colorado, to do the types of things that we did as we bucked up our business in Atlanta and took a leading position in Maryland. And to the extent that we can do that in markets that continue to exhibit good population trends, good state fiscal health, multiple end use drivers those are the types of things that we're focused on. When we did sort of 2020 our aim was to be to the point that we had something that looked like an enterprise value of around $20 billion by the time we get into 2020. I think when we rolled that out most people who were looking at it would have been too kind to have said you can't do it but they may well have thought it and we largely did it. So as we think about sort of 2025 we will continue to be, we'll probably put some numbers out that can look aspirational. We think they're doable and that's how we intend to grow the business.
Brent Thielman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank You Brent.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from [indiscernible] Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks. Just wondering as you look out to 2020 you came out with a preliminary volume outlook after 3Q which was low to mid single digits and here you're out with a 2% to 4% increase. So pretty similar rate of growth but just wondering just over the last three months has anything shifted good or bad just around your view of the end markets relative to when you came out with preliminary outlook [indiscernible]? 
Howard Nye: What I would say [Gareth] and I would say this is more gut than it is math. So forgive me for that. I would think the sentiment is broadly better now than it was three or four months ago. So if we're going back to the period of time when we would have been going through planning or a budgeting cycle in the fall and took a poll of our division Presidents and Vice Presidents and general managers said okay how do you feel last October, how do you feel now. I think there's a general rule they feel better now than when they felt that. And by the way they didn't go bad then?
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just to clarify some of the expenses that hit in the fourth quarter particularly related to grading. Is there anything to call out if you look out just as far as the cadence of some of these lumpier expenses into 2020 just how you're planning on some of these larger cost items?
Howard Nye: No. I don't think so. For example I think our [Q1] expenses will actually be friendlier in ‘20 than they were in ‘19 for some of the reasons we discussed and I think we've actually on some of the catch-up grading that we've done. I think we're sitting in the type of place that you would expect. I think the CapEx that we've been putting into mobile equipment will continue to be our friend relative to maintenance and repair. So [Gareth] there is not a cadence out there this year that I would be wanting to highlight to you right now. I think the big driver for a little bit of a stutter step there at year-end was volumes were just up more than the people would have thought and because of that we had some catch-up to do but we don't see that in ‘20 right now
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks again.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Good morning everybody. Thank you all for taking the question. Hey on the capital spend side I think you kind of touched on a little bit but you had been run an elevator in close with depreciation. Can you talk a little bit about what the plans for CapEx or I mean is it rolling stock like you called out? Is an expansion projects just trying to get a flavor for you see the most opportunity?
Jim Nickolas: Yes. Hey Stanley it's Jim. So I would say in aggregates in total our CapEx is roughly constant as a percent of sales and we've been doing that in ‘18 and ‘19 and expect the same in 2020. We have been spending more on mobile in the prior years. We are shifting a bit now to plant upgrades and efficiency improvements. So I would say we're close to, most of it is maintenance capital but it’s efficiency improvement capital at the same time. So no searching is going forward there.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect and then last questions on kind of the one off stripping your cost there. Are you seeing anything else within the cost environment that's concerning and heading into 2020 be it labor or energy costs or anything else that you would want to call out we should be aware of?
Howard Nye: Stanley we're really not. If you look back several years’ labor has never been an issue for us. It doesn't look like it's going to be this year either and as we're looking at the other inputs again we feel very confident with it. So I don't see anything that would really move in that respect.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
Howard Nye: Thanks you Stanley.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys.
Howard Nye: Hi Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Howard, I wanted to start on aggregates pricing. I just wanted to make sure I understood I mean pricing accelerated all throughout 2019. We got it accelerating again in 2020. I'm just curious what's really driving that?
Howard Nye: I think volume is clearly a friend on that and obviously in the fourth quarter there was some degree of mix relative to rail and we did that. But again if we go back over time part of what we've seen Adam and we've spoken of it I think it surprised people that we would have the ability to get price in a down market but we did and part of what we indicated as we thought we would have even more ability to get price centered on market and I think that's what you saw last year. Keep in mind we end up being at the end of the day a relatively small piece of overall construction from a cost perspective 10% of the cost of building road, 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those percentages on a non-resident project we are [selling] the product that's going to make or break a general contractor or sub on either getting the job, not getting the job or being profitable. At the same time we have a product in the ground that gets more valuable by the day and we want to make sure that we have the ability to capture that value because the barriers to entry continue to be very, very high. So I think you have all of those factors coalescing and I think that's evidence in what you see the pricing.
Adam Thalhimer: And then I think it was in their letter Howard you called out the wind projects being a slight headwind this year. Can you just give us some more color on that? How impactful is that?
Adam Thalhimer: So [no point intended on the] wind projects being a headwind right. So what we're seeing Adam is really the tax investment credits and if projects aren't under construction at the end of 2020, really that's been an issue in two areas for us one in the Midwest and to a degree in the southwest more in the Midwest than in Southwest. Right now we don't see it as a notable headwind. We really just more called it out because we recognize that the tax credits are going away and we want to be sensitive to it and the other thing that we're sensitive to it I spoke about the fact that Midwest volume is going into the year look relatively flat to last year but Midwest volumes last year were really up. So that's an area the country on a percentage basis we just want to be thoughtful around.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Congrats.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Michael [indiscernible] Research. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning gentlemen and Suzanne. 
Howard Nye: Good morning Michael.
Unidentified Analyst: You called in your release this morning, you talked about the path potential positive on regulatory driven improvement in efficiency and trying to get projects let. Any sense on how company think that will come through given what's going on in politics wise and how that could impact maybe this cadence in term on lettings in the next couple of years and maybe you combine that with them maybe potential federal bill and say 2021 or 2022. 
Howard Nye: Sure. Michael it's going to be scientific and anecdotal all at the same time. So have we seen some states go from taking seven years to get jobs out to being more like two years to get jobs that we have and has North Carolina for example been a part of that? Absolutely. Have we seen other states getting better at that? No doubt. And even in the president's draft budget that he's put out of course he's talking about the total $1 trillion infrastructure investments. So that's the broader picture that he has painted at the same time even he starts talking about in that broad-based budget more of what he would like to see done. I think we've seen some edges of it in NEPA reform on what can happen on getting projects approved more quickly. So what I will tell you is kind of sit here today and give you definitive numbers on what we think they would be up. No, I can't but at the same time can I look over the past several years and say that North Carolina for example was able to go through $2 billion that had really been put on the shelves because they couldn't get jobs out as quickly as they wanted to because they had gotten more efficient at it. Yes, do we think it will continue to get it better at the federal level? Yes. And do we think that will likely be part of a new highway bill? We think it probably will be.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great, great color. Thanks for that Howard. Just one quick follow-up when you talking back to M&A and how you're looking at or having active discussion so many folks are those folks also expectations moving higher given some of the publicly available data and the expectations that I think most people have in the industry and is that causing some of maybe, some lockup relative to things maybe getting done in a more rapid environment in the next say 6 to 18 months?
Howard Nye: Michael, I think it can vary a lot. I think it can vary depending on are you talking branded, are you talking limestone and rock and sand and gravel, are you talking of pure play or are you talking to vertical play, are you talking East coast are you talking middle of the country or West. So I think it moves around. What I would say at the end of the day is people recognize these are very valuable businesses. Often times they are justifiably pretty proud of them which is one of the reasons that we have to make sure that we can get a good synergy when we go and do these transactions. So again I think there's a lot of dialogue. We will not overreach on things. We will continue to be responsible with it but we're certainly seeing things today that if things come together we can execute on and I think do quite well with them.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent response. Thanks Howard.
Howard Nye: Michael, thank you and again welcome to the call.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Seldon Clarke: Hey guys thanks for the question. Just sticking with M&A, how much capacity do you think you have for the right deal and just could you give us a sense of maybe how many deals you think are potentially out there that could still move the needle for you guys?
Howard Nye: Well I'll tell you what let me do this way. I'll address the second part of it and that is the quantum of deals. I'll let Jim come back and talk a little bit about firepower. The fact is we're always engaged in at least or probably more than a handful of dialogues and again they can vary pretty considerably in size. So the conversations continue to be regular and they continue to be rich in many respects and rich I don't mean numbers, I mean just in the form of dialogue. That's it and let me turn it over to Jim and he can talk a little bit about firepower.
Jim Nickolas: Well, we did acquire Bluegrass for $1.6 billion a few years ago. We did that comfortably and delevered rapidly. We could do that size and larger today readily. So I say we have ample firepower we can do a larger deals. We can do multiple or medium-sized deals and again it is our top priority getting the right acquisition at the right price. So we will make it happen if we need to but it would be very comfortable for us from firepower perspective to do any deals that would be coming to fruition the next two years?
Seldon Clarke: Okay. That's helpful and then just what's going on with elevated valuations, I mean if the right deal doesn't present itself? What do you think the right kind of leverage ratio is on a more ongoing basis and how should we think about capital deployment ex-M&A?
Jim Nickolas: Well, our priorities have not changed and so I’ll answer the second part of the question first aside M&A the reinvesting in the business and CapEx we talked about that roughly 8%-9% of sales typically what we shoot for. It's what we've been doing and beyond that we are returning capital to shareholders in the form of higher dividends which we've been doing last couple years, meaningful increases in the dividend rate and then share buyback which we have also been doing in the last few years. So we'll continue to do those two things. In terms of leverage we have a stated target leverage of 2 to 2.5 times. We are currently at the lower end of that range. Of course that's done in the context of M&A pipeline, in the context of economic outlook and our expectations for the year. So there's no static view we take but by and large 2 to 2.5 times is our debt EBITDA ratio.
Howard Nye: Seldon, if we think about what's happened over the last 24 months, 18 months we've done the second largest transaction in our company's history. The year before that we raised our dividend by 9%. This past year by 15%. Obviously the board will look at that again in August but to do a transaction the way that we did with Bluegrass to delever as quickly as we did to be in a position to take the dividend up and buy shares back is a very nice place to be and I think that speaks well to the discipline that the team has shown overall on capital requirement.
Seldon Clarke: Fine. I appreciate the questions. Thanks guys.
Howard Nye: Thank you Seldon and again thank you for joining our call today.
Seldon Clarke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Adrian Huerta of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Adrian Huerta: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions one is on cement prices specifically in Texas. What are your views on impropriety prices for Texas and if you think that that could drive potentially even higher increases on cement prices? And the second one is on your guidance for cement gross profit. Aside from prices what else are you expecting to drive margins higher this year?
Howard Nye: I guess number one Adrian thank you for your question. Number two, if we just look at Texas cement overall and Texas consumed about 18.7 million tons of cement last year. About 13.5 of that was from domestic producers in Texas. So the short answer is you're going to have to have some degree of import that's coming into the state right now simply to meet the needs. I think if you look at where our plants are very much by design in Dallas Fort Worth and in San Antonio they have ability for water imports to come in and meaningfully interdict our businesses is low and again that's by design. I think you will continue to see the need and the desire for cement to continue to go up in that state. I think the fact that we're talking about an $8 ton price increase there, demonstrates that demand supply band is going to be somewhere in our favor. Clearly that is going to help drive our business. The other thing that I would say to your point we will clearly have less kiln maintenance expenses in ‘20 than we had last year and then the number that we know it's going to be real it's just a more elusive number is what you get from the shear efficiencies that we believe we will recognize that both Midlothian and at Hunter. Again, as I look across the business and think about the areas that I think have the potential to have a really pretty special year this year. I would put cement somewhere near the head of that list Adrian
Adrian Huerta: Excellent. Thank you, Howard.
Howard Nye: You are welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Chabran, of On Field Investment Research. Your line is now open.
Paul Chabran: Hi good morning gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just one question if I may. We are seeing more and more large aggregate producers nowadays moving towards recycle aggregates. I just want to understand whether it's something that you’d be considering and if so what do you think could be the impact on the value of your aggregate result? Another quick follow-up on coming on the -- you mentioned that aggregates volume have been hit by some delays in infrastructure project in North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. If I remember well could you give us an idea of what your volumes would have been in Q4 excluding this impact? 
Howard Nye: Absolutely try to. Let's do the recycle issue first and what I would say Paul is recycle is going to be an issue that's not going to hit all markets the same way it's going to hit different markets differently. So if you think of our markets such as Los Angeles or markets such as Houston that really in LA you've got depletion. In Houston, you have no coarse aggregates that are indigenous there, which means that is you have certain destruction of buildings, you can have crush concrete in that marketplace that can be used in some instances as a base material. Keep in mind in many instances recycle is going to be more usable in a commercial application as supposed to a DOT application because oftentimes they won't meet the more rigorous DOT specifications. So what I would say is -- while I think today's pricing is in aggregates and what I think, frankly think they're going to be for the next decade when you see more recycle on the edges I think you will on occasion. I don't think it's going to be a huge displacing factor. Keep in mind even recycle that you see in recycled asphalt commonly referred to as wrap is really more used to pull the liquid out of buildings as opposed to the stone. So I think we see it that way. Relative to the second part of your question that was with respect to delays what I would say is clearly we did see some of delays in Georgia. We saw some delays in North Carolina. I don't want to quantify exactly how much I think that would have moved the aggregate tonnage. I think it would have moved it a bit. Importantly those are high profit states. So I think it probably would have hit more bottom line on profits as opposed to bottom line relative to volumes.
Paul Chabran: Okay. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you Paul.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas, your line is now open.
Rob Whitworth: Hi, hello. This is Rob Whitworth on for Paul Roger.
Howard Nye: Very good.
Rob Whitworth: Hi there. I want to start by asking is this going to accelerate Greenfield investment spending and what returns you typically make on these investments?
Howard Nye: I'm sorry Rob relative to Greenfield? 
Rob Whitworth: Yes, please.
Howard Nye: Yes. I guess we would say several things. We think there is a role in what we do for green fielding at the same time if we look at our volume this past year at 191 million tons and we look all the way through a cycle. I would ask you to remember this at the peak of last cycle we produced and sold 205 million tons. At the bottom of the last cycle 125 million tons and 191 last year. Of that 191, 40 million tons are due to acquisitions over the last decade-ish. So we're comparing same on same all the way through a cycle take the 190 that we just finished within 2019. Take 40 million tons from it, it puts us at 150 million tons same on same versus 205 at peak and 125 at the bottom. That's not a long way of saying I don't think we're in a position today that adding Greenfield sites is a particularly value enhancing strategy for us. We have ample reserves and very attractive markets. Green fielding to me is when you want to go into a new market or you've got reserves that you're trying to protect. The other thing that I would say is most Greenfield applications will probably take around seven years to put in and again you've got several components you have to be mindful of number one environmentally what you're dealing with delegated state authority from using federal statutes but then more importantly what's happening relative to local land use. Rob that's the piece of it in the United States, but I think most people miss because, I think most people feel like the bigger issue is environmental. The bigger issue is in fact land use. So as we think about it have we opened the single largest Greenfield operation on the Union Pacific's vast network about five years ago? We have but again a very strategic play to make sure we can supply DOT spec stone and to Houston for a generation. Have we looked at opening underground mines in places like in the Midwestern U.S.? We have but we haven't taken on a slew of green fields because at the end of the day we don't think it's the best use of our capital.
Rob Whitworth: Very clear. Thank you. And just as a follow-up you did touch on this slightly earlier but your asphalt margins disappointed a bit again and I appreciate this is mostly bad weather in Colorado but in terms of looking ahead do you see a big potential improvement in 2020 given a potential tailwind from IMO 2020?
Howard Nye: No, I do think we'll see a potential tailwind. I mean again weather was the primary driver for the variance that you've seen. We talked a little bit about the sheer quantum of days that we lost because of the weather. If we look at the backlogs that we have in that business going into the year they really look very, very good. If we look in from a customer perspective, we're looking at already over 50% of our backlog being booked for the year and for me need to be able to say that to you in the first half of February is a pretty heavy place.
Rob Whitworth: Brilliant. Thank you. 
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Howard Nye for any closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Well thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. We continue to focus on maximizing value for shareholders as we build on our strong results and strive to realize the company's full potential. Given Martin Marietta’s world class attributes and our expectation of a sustainable and steady public private sector construction activity we believe 2020 will be another record year for Martin Marietta. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2020 results in a few months. As always we're available to answer any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Crystal, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q3 2019 supplemental information, that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the third quarter 2019, any comparisons are versus the prior year third quarter, and all margin references are based on revenues. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Howard Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance as well as market trends as we conclude 2019 and head into 2020. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow up. With that, I will now turn the call over to Howard.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. This morning, we released record setting third quarter results. Martin Marietta's disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan together with our commitment to operational excellence provides a foundation for our Company to consistently deliver industry-leading performance. We were able to once again establish new quarterly company records for revenues and profits and year-to-date records for safety. We expect that trend will continue for the remainder of 2019 keeping us on track to announce record full-year results when we report next quarter. In short, Martin Marietta is safer and more profitable than ever. Driven by widespread improvements in shipments, pricing and profitability across most of our Building Materials business, we delivered outstanding third quarter performance. Consolidated total revenues increased 16% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 34% to $421 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to $439 million, and fully diluted earnings per share was $3.96, a 39% improvement. Supported by the strong performance and encouraging trends, we raised the midpoint of our full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.275 billion. We've consistently observed that attractive market fundamentals including employment gains, favorable population trends and superior state fiscal health promote sustainable and long-term construction growth. Mindful of these vital attributes, we have purposefully positioned our business geographically and otherwise to be aggregates led in high growth markets. We've also aligned our product offerings to leverage our strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. This proven strategy combined with our pricing discipline underscores our continued ability to capitalize on the robust underlying demand in our key states. That's why we remain confident that increased infrastructure activity from state and local transportation funding initiatives together with continued strength in private sector activity will support steady, sustainable construction growth in our top 10 states, that outpaces the nation as a whole for the foreseeable future. With that as a backdrop, let's review our third quarter operating results in more detail. Robust product demand and favorable weather led to a 12% increase in aggregates shipments. Notably, all divisions and primary end-use markets contributed to this growth, demonstrating strong underlying demand and our ability to capitalize on it. Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market increased 7%. As anticipated, shipments for transportation-related projects meaningfully accelerated in our key states of North Carolina, Iowa and Maryland supported by funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act and numerous state and local transportation initiatives. We anticipate public construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets to continue to benefiting from the acceleration of state lettings and contract awards in our key states and ongoing federal and state funding. While a successor infrastructure bill has yet to be fully agreed upon by our elected representatives, all indications are that federal transportation funding will continue at a minimum at status quo levels even if the FAST Act expires by its own terms in September 2020 without the immediate passage of multi-year follow-on legislation. We see little appetite for recurrence of the series of short-term continuing resolutions seen prior to the enactment of the FAST Act in December of 2015. This sentiment is evident and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's July 2019 draft of a highway authorization bill. This bipartisan effort backed both Republican Chairman, John Barrasso of Wyoming and ranking member Democrat Tom Carper of Delaware, proposes authorizing federal highway funding at $287 billion over the next five years, a 28% increase over the previous authorization's funding levels. Further, the expectation is that the United States House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will propose investment levels even higher than those offered from the Senate. Accordingly, we believe the necessary confidence and funding securities in place for states to continue to move forward on planned and future construction projects. Furthermore, particularly in the near term, state level funding should continue to grow at a faster rate than federal funding leading to additional infrastructure investment benefiting Martin Marietta. As a reminder, our top 10 states, which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. The infrastructure market represented 38% of our third quarter aggregates shipments, which was below the Company's most recent 10-year annual average of 46%. Since infrastructure is Martin Marietta's most aggregates-intensive end use, the public works growth we're seeing and expecting is encouraging. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased 19%, with broad-based strength in distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in Texas, the Carolinas, Iowa and Maryland. Additionally, we benefited from the reemergence of several large energy sector projects along the Texas Gulf Coast which accounted for nearly 500,000 tons of aggregates shipments during the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe continued employment and population gains will provide the impetus for sustainable commercial construction activity, particularly in our Southeastern and Southwestern regions. The nonresidential market represented 34% of our third quarter aggregates shipments. Aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 16%, led by attractive homebuilding activity in Texas, Colorado, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Among other things, homebuilders are now noting improved demand from first-time buyers. We expect continued residential construction growth for both single- and multi-family housing across our geographic footprint, driven by favorable population demographics, job growth, land availability, attractive mortgage rates and efficient permitting. Currently, permit growth, which in our view is the best indicator of future housing construction activity, is outpacing the national average for both multi-family and single-family housing units in our top 10 states. The residential market accounted for 22% of our third quarter aggregates shipments. To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 6% of aggregates shipments. Volumes increased 4% driven by improved ballast shipments to the Class 1 railroads for continued repair projects from the flooding in the Midwest earlier this year. Based on recent trends and our year-to-date volume growth, we raised our full-year 2019 aggregates shipment guidance from an increase of 8% to 10% to an increase of 11% to 12%. Aggregates pricing improved 5%, reflecting our disciplined pricing strategy and the comparative strength of our markets. By region, the West Group posted aggregates pricing growth of 9%, which reflects favorable geographic mix and product mix. The Southeast Group achieved pricing growth of nearly 6%, driven by market strength and a higher percentage of long-haul shipments from our higher priced distribution terminals. Our focus on pricing led to a 3.5% improvement for the Mid America Group. Full-year 2019 aggregates pricing is anticipated to increase 4% to 5%. We expect continued pricing momentum in 2020. Our cement shipments increased 21% to a new quarterly volume record of 1.1 million tons, driven by healthy Texas demand as well as weather-deferred projects from earlier in the year. Cement pricing improved nearly 2% despite unfavorable product mix from a lower percentage of oil well cement shipments. with a robust bidding pipeline, we believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from the tight supply and healthy demand in Texas as well as our recently announced price increase effective April 2020. Turning to our downstream businesses; ready mixed concrete shipments increased 9% led by double-digit growth in the Southwest Division. Our Rocky Mountain Division experienced project delays which tempered shipment growth. Pricing declined 2% overall as unfavorable product mix and a shift in Texas customer segmentation affected pricing and offset solid pricing gains in Colorado. Our asphalt and paving business, which operates solely in Colorado, benefited from strong customer backlogs and favorable weather conditions resulting in a 34% increase in asphalt shipments. Asphalt pricing, improved 3%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our third quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Howard. The Building Materials business achieved record quarterly products and services revenues of $1.3 billion, an 18% increase and record product gross profit of $396 million, a 37% increase. Notably, all the Building Materials product lines contributed to this broad-based growth. Aggregates product gross margin increased 480 basis points to 35.1%. This margin expansion was driven by higher prices as well as improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels enabled by strong demand and improved weather. The absence of the negative impact from selling acquired inventory burdened by acquisition accounting in 2018 as part of our purchase of Bluegrass Materials was an additional tailwind. As Howard mentioned, our cement operations benefited from both volume and pricing growth resulting in product revenues of $120 million and gross profit of $49 million, both all-time records. Top line improvement coupled with production efficiencies and lower fuel and maintenance costs led to a 750-basis point expansion of product gross margin to 40.6%. Magnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 13% to $59 million as chemicals and lime customers reduced inventory levels to align with current demand. However, despite the low revenues, enhanced cost control measures contributed to the 120-basis point improvement in product gross margin to 40.4%. We lowered full-year product revenues and gross profit guidance for the Magnesia Specialties business to reflect current customer activity. Our business is generating significant cash. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30 increased nearly 50% over the comparable prior-year period. This improvement was driven by growth in earnings and lower contributions to our already well-funded pension plan. We will continue with the balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities we have long followed to further enhance shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility. Those priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. Building on my comments about our very strong cash flows, we are pleased to report that less than 18 months after the second largest acquisition in the Company's history, we have de-levered from the Bluegrass Materials transaction and returned, as we said we would, to our target leverage ratio range of 2 times to 2.5 times. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2019, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our applicable credit agreement, was 2.3 times. In addition, we remain appropriately focused on returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases. Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and our significant cash generation, our Board of Directors recently approved a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, one of the large increases in the Company's history. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.20. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program, we have returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders since February 2015, while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. Based on recent trends and our strong performance to-date, we have raised our full-year 2019 outlook. As detailed in today's release, we now expect consolidated total revenues in the range of $4.660 billion to $4.770 billion, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.305 billion. With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard.
Howard Nye: Jim, thank you. To conclude, we are proud of the results we posted in the third quarter. And while we're pleased with the numbers, we don't see the performance as surprising. That's because, in nearly every respect, we have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans, positioning our business as an aggregate’s leader in attractive, high-growth geographies. We didn't get here by accident. Over the past several years, through our steadfast and proven strategy and stability to the world-class attributes of our business, safety, ethics, cost discipline, and operational excellence. Martin Marietta has positioned itself to outperform. With this in mind, we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020. Supported by attractive underlying market fundamentals across our geographic footprint, and region-specific third-party forecasts, we believe the current construction cycle will continue for the foreseeable future and expand at a steady pace in 2020. Our outlook is positive across each of our primary construction end-use markets. Our preliminary view anticipates low- to mid-single digit growth in aggregates shipments and mid-single digit growth in aggregates pricing in 2020. Martin Marietta remains committed to the steadfast and proven strategy we developed and executed during our 25 years as a public company. We will drive continued improvement and excellence as we responsibly manage and grow our business to create long-term value for our shareholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First, following up on 2020 guidance. Could you flesh out the drivers for the high level of volume and pricing guidance for aggregates? Particularly on the volume side, just to what extent is it dictated by real demand versus just difficulty getting work done because of the tight labor market? And then also any thoughts on cement in Texas would be helpful. In particular, what type of color of energy end-market projects that have been driving the demand now and into 2020? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure, Kathryn. Good morning and thank you. As we look at next year, one of the key drivers in our mind, Kathryn, is simply taking a look at where our customer backlogs are at this time of year versus where they were last year. So to give you a good sense of that, if we're looking at Q3 2019 backlog in Mid-Atlantic, our customers, it looks like were up about 57% versus where they were last year in backlog. If we're looking in the Midwest, major project backlog, looks like it's up around 11%. Similarly, if we look in places like the Southwest, and ready mixed backlogs were up 12% driven by market growth in both the North and the South, and then to your point, cement backlog from what we can tell is us up over 65% driven by major project work, and that includes large DOT projects, Kathryn. So as we look at what our customers are telling us, that's giving us the confidence going into the new year, it's the same type of thing we're seeing in Colorado right now, Rocky Mountain customers are saying their backlogs are up around 12%. So as we look at where the growth is coming, as we indicated we see infrastructure better, we see non-res better, we see residential better next year as well. Specifically, with respect to cement, as I indicated, a lot of it is major project driven. That's very healthy both in North Texas and in Central Texas. As you recall, the two cement plants we have are in Midlothian in North Texas and Hunter in Central Texas. Part of what I think is important in that marketplace too is what we're seeing relative to pricing in 2020. We have put out our pricing letter for next year. We're anticipating an $8 a ton increase in Texas, that's going to be effective April 1. So again, if we look at volume across the aggregates business, we see it being widespread and we see it nice and steady, and we see good customer backlogs. We see the same thing in cement. And again, this is going to be more driven by public works we believe in Texas. And again, we think the pricing environment as we go into 2020, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, both in aggregates and cement looks better going into '20 than it did coming into '19, and it looked better coming into '19 than it did coming into '18. So a long answer, but I think you need that color on where the volumes coming from and how we see pricing as well.
Kathryn Thompson: Perfect, that's helpful. One follow-up on North Carolina, in particular, we understand that the North Carolina legislature is working on a $600 million transfer to DOT from the general fund to make up for really transitory issues related to storm damage and lawsuits. Our work is showing that this is more a transitory issue and not necessarily impacting revenue generation for new construction. Could you clarify this is accurate and thoughts on the likelihood of closing this gap? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, thank you for the question. I can confirm that that's the way that we see it too. The thing to keep in mind, Kathryn, NCDOT has incurred more disaster-related spending in the last three years than in the previous 12 years combined. So if you look at the business that we had last year and the flooding that we had in East and North Carolina, that's Exhibit A to it. The issue is simply this, the theme of reimbursements are taking four years or five years to come in and the legislature understands that. So to your point, have we seen the North Carolina House already come forward with the $600 million proposed bill? We have. Do we anticipate that the North Carolina Senate will come up with its own formula? We believe that they will, and we think they're going to address that before they leave town. To your point, this is really just approaching something from late this year to early next year, we do view it as transitory. We do believe that the legislature understands this is something that they need to remedy. And we believe that they're committed to remedying it. So, I think your word transitory is indeed the right word.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Thanks for it. So I guess my main question, first question I guess is on ARTBA, you know, some of the contract award data that we've been seeing there has been weakening a bit lately and I think it has created some concern with some folks over the health of the infrastructure market looking into next year, but it sounds like your customer backlogs look very good. You continue to expect public demand to continue to improve in the next year. And I understand this data can be choppy and I think some of your states are lapping tough comps, but can you help us bridge the gap here with what the ARTBA contract award data has been telling us over the last few months and kind of what you're expecting on the public side going forward?
Jim Nickolas: Yes, sure. Trey, thanks for the question. And really, I'm going to try to bridge it for you using some data that pertains directly to bridges, because I think that will help get you there. Look, first of all, when you look at the ARTBA data, I think one thing that you can do is look at it into vacuum because you missed the longer run dynamics of what's happening with marketplace. So to your point, you can see some issues on a month-to-month basis that can cause swings that actually belie the longer-term trends. So look -- if you look in September of 2018, Colorado had $1.5 billion of awards versus an average of $40 million. So if you've got just a number in a month like that, it can move things around pretty considerably. So I think what you're referring to is when ARTBA came out and said, look, we're looking at trailing 12 months of highways, bridges and tunnels, and at the end of September, they said, it's down 4.5%-ish. What's happening within that is this, if you look at bridges and tunnels and that's back to my note, my observation with you on really bridging this, bridging and tunnels -- bridges and tunnels are down almost 13%, trailing 12 months of highways down 2.1%. But more importantly, if we look at current highway awards, they're 13% above 2017 levels and one of the things that I think it's important to remember is if you're sitting where we sit and that's as part of an aggregates-led company, you're going to be much more focused on what's happening with highways, than you are relative to what's happening with bridges. Equally, if you're coming out of a downturn, and you feel like you may have some safety issues with bridges, you're going to repair those bridges early on and then back off of that and pivot to the highways. So again, if we're looking at the pivot from bridges to highways, in my view, that's totally accepted, and then more importantly, if you look at what the trend has been, I think you'll actually be very comfortable with the trend, and I would encourage people please don't overreact to just monthly swings because that type of lumpiness can just occur and it's nothing in our view to be alarmed over. The long-term trend is quite positive. And as I indicated, the backlogs that our customers are speaking up on the public side is really very attractive.
Trey Grooms: All right, thanks for that. That is helpful. As from a follow-up, you gave us the backdrop here with your expectation of kind of mid- to high-single digit volume, mid-single digit pricing in aggregates next year. So can you talk about your expectations for cost inflation or maybe any geographic trends that you might be expecting that can impact pricing and margins and maybe how you're thinking about profitability and incremental flow-through in that environment?
Howard Nye: Look, obviously, we will give you a much more granular look-see in 2020 when we come out in February. One note I would make Trey is, on the volume, we're saying, low- to mid-single. I think you misspoke on the percentages that you speaking of in the premise of your question. That's better off. Part of what I would say is, look, do we see any components of our cost structure that we're troubled by? We're not. I mean, we are very focused on costs every day in our business. The single biggest cost drag what we have is labor and we believe we have labor well controlled. So we don't see inflationary actions are occurring there that we think it could be disruptive. Equally, we see energy is really quite well behaved. If you look at the investments that we've made both in plant and in rolling stock over the last several years, we should continue to see nice trends relative to maintenance and repair, and remember, Trey, we have about five areas, labor, maintenance and repair, supplies, DD&A, and energy that are really the drivers of what's going to happen from a cost perspective in our business. So do we see things in that a way that cause us any concern? We do not. Equally, going back to the commentary that I offered just a few minutes ago, we believe the pricing environment continues to be attractive, and I think it's getting more attractive. One of the metrics that we've long spoken of is that while we tend to be in a position because of an array of factors including the reserves that you just have to take good care of, we tend to get pricing all the way through cycles, we do better after big volume years too, and this is a volume year where we think we're going to be able to come in in 2020 and actually do better on pricing in '20 than we have in '19. So again, our cost profile looks very attractive from our perspective, pricing looks increasingly attractive going into '20. We'll give you a more definitive view of how that's going to translate to EBITDA and gross profit etcetera when we speak again in February.
Trey Grooms: Okay, thank you very much. And just a housekeeping, since you brought up repair and maintenance. Is there anything kind of looking into 4Q that we need to be aware of from a repair and maintenance or stripping costs or timing of anything that can swing around in the 4Q that we should be talking about?
Howard Nye: You know, I think we tried to capture it in the guidance that we've given. One thing that we will be doing, obviously we have sold considerable amount of tonnage this year. And when you're selling tonnage, one of the high-class problems you have from that is you do have more stripping that you need to do and we're going to try to do some of that in Q4 to stay ahead of it and to have us where we need to be as we enter 2020.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Thanks for all the color.
Howard Nye: You're welcome. Thank you, Trey.
Trey Grooms: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you all for fitting me in and congrats on nice quarter. Jim, this is more for you, you guys are 2.3 times right now. The commentary from the field that we are hearing is very encouraging into next year, should be another year of good incrementals and another good year of cash flow. What -- how are you all thinking about uses of that cash, especially with opportunities for M&A, it's been fairly quiet year recently, but I would love to get your thoughts on that. What do you want to run at a lower leverage level or if you're more interested in putting it to work? And just kind of how you're conceptually thinking about the capital structure. At this point?
Howard Nye: Well, Stanley, thank you for the question. As you've noted, we've got a high-class worry because this business is delevering exactly the way that we thought it would as we bought Bluegrass. Let me turn that specifically over to Jim to talk through what our capital priorities are because what you'll hear is they haven't changed.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, Stanley, thank you for the question. Our first call on capital is the right acquisition. I want to make sure we've got the dry powder to be in a position to take advantage of strategic and value-enhancing acquisitions. Of course, the next priority for us is investing in our business. Beyond that you'll see -- you'll continue to see a balanced approach. We meaningfully delivered this year as planned. I would expect some further delevering to continue next year but not to the same extent we saw this year. Returning capital to our shareholders beyond that in the form of higher dividend and share repurchases will likely play a larger role in 2020, assuming our leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range 2 times to 2.5 times.
Howard Nye: And Stanley, obviously, as Jim said, the first call on capital is doing the right deals. And I have to brag on our team. I think our team is very good at identifying the transactions. I think they do a superb job going through the contracting piece of it when we really paper the deal and part of what we've been able to do very successfully is synergize deals as well. So again, our priorities have not changed and we're very pleased to be sitting here at this leverage ratio within the relatively short period of time since we closed on Bluegrass.
Stanley Elliott: Absolutely. With the higher volumes, some of the higher repair and maintenance costs, does that mean CapEx will stay elevated in next year or is that something that can kind of be a further contributor to free cash?
Jim Nickolas: Stanley, I think CapEx would be relatively constant as a percent of the size of the business. So I wouldn't view today's elevated. I think it's the right level and next year it will be consistently sized vis-a-vis the business size as well. So you can think about in terms of percent of sales, we wouldn't expect it to change terribly next year.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect, thank you very much for the time. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Roger from Exane. Your line is open.
Paul Roger: Hi, good morning guys, congratulations on the strong results. So I just have a question. First off, going back to the cement business. You talked about the demand outlook and what you're going to see it in there. Maybe you could comment a bit more on the margin. Obviously, you had a very strong margin performance in Q3. Was there anything the sort of specific in that time to maintenance costs or something like that? I just don't have any reason why the sort of high 30% to low 40% isn't sustainable going into 2020 for the cement division.
Howard Nye: First of all, good morning, for us and good afternoon to you. So most of your voice, Paul, you know, but there was nothing particularly extraordinary in the quarter. I mean obviously volume was really quite good. If we look at year-to-date pricing, that was up 3.3%. One of the big things that our team is focused on in cement right now is reliability and just making sure that those kilns keep running [Technical Difficulty] Sorry about that. I'm not sure what that was. Are you still with us, Paul?
Paul Roger: Yes, I am. Yes, I can hear you.
Howard Nye: Okay, very good. We had some bad feedback here in the room. So we're focused on making sure we have reliability where it needs to be and we're focused on making sure that we can take care of our customers, and one of our biggest customers in that market happens to be us. So again, I think the cement business is having a very good business -- very good year this year. I think it's going to have a very good year next year. When we bought this business, we anticipated that the cement business that we refer to as strategic cement could have margins that are very similar to the types of margins that we see in our very attractive aggregates business, and I'm pleased to say that's exactly what we're seeing.
Paul Roger: That's good. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the big energy projects you're seeing on the Gulf Coast. Clearly, I think you said they accounted for about 0.5 million tons of shipments in Q3. So at the minute, they're obviously a relatively small driver. Do you expect that to change as these schemes of lump up and sort of how meaningful could this type of work be in the medium term?
Howard Nye: No, you're exactly right. As we look at the quarter, there were nearly 500,000 shipments in Q3 and that's a little bit over a 1 million shipments year-to-date at least through September, at the end of the quarter. Part of what I like looking at, Paul, is it had a nice build throughout the year. So about 240,000 tons in Q1, about 450,000 tons in Q2, we're getting close to 500,000 tons obviously in Q3. We think we're going to continue to see good steady energy work in South Texas for a while. I can tell you, we were down there with the team several weeks ago, these are mammoth projects and these are mammoth projects in wonderfully swampy wet land that's going to take a lot of aggregates to have it into condition that needs to build. To give you a sense of what the scope can be if we're looking at a series of projects that we're working on now, but more importantly if we look at projects into the future, that we should be good candidates for including Driftwood LNG, continued work at Golden Pass, what we think is probably coming at Port Arthur. Those three combined with others would demonstrate to us that there is still about 17 million tons worth of projects along the Gulf Coast, that we should be well positioned to get our share out. So we think that's going to be busy workforce. The other thing that's going to be worth watching is what happens with high-speed rail in Texas because they're clearly very interested in putting in around the 240-mile lane of dedicated track high speed between Dallas and Houston with the stop ash in College Station. This would be a very large project, it's not going to be 2020 issue, but again, if we look at these large energy projects, they are 2020 issues and beyond 2020. If we look at this type rail -- high-speed rail that could be coming to Texas, those are good attractive long-term projects as well and upward, people say that there could be upwards of 30 million tons of aggregates need on those types of projects. So we feel like non-res in our footprint, it will continue to be really attractive, and we think the Texas market in particular has been good and we think it's going to stay very good.
Paul Roger: That's great, thank you very much. It's nice to participate today.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Phil Ng: Hi guys, congrats on a strong quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Phil.
Phil Ng: You're welcome. You're obviously lapping a very tough comp this year just given the strength you've put up on volumes. Could you comment on backlogs sound quite good for next year. Could there be some upside on your low- to mid-single digit volume outlook for 2020? And if you had to rank the level of confidence between the three different end markets you're exposed to, how do you think about it for 2020?
Howard Nye: So you slide that well trying to get me talk more about 2020. We will give you some really good color on that when we get into February. If I'm thinking about the three, obviously, the commentary said that we think, well, of all three of them going into 2020, which is true. And I think what we will continue to see though is that good, steady build in infrastructure. So if you go back to the commentary that we offered in the prepared remarks, we spoke about the percentage of infrastructure in our business today and what a 10-year average looks like. I'm not suggesting it's going to both back up to 10-year averages, I'm suggesting it's going to be a nice slow, steady climb back to some numbers that have a consistent form in front of them. We think that makes good sense. If we look at the year and really think about where non-res has been, non-res has been somewhere in the mid-30s this year. I mean those are at least on a historical perspective pretty high percentages. At the same time, we go back to the conversation I was having with Paul just a minute ago and you think about what some of those non-res projects can be, it's pretty big tonnage. And the other thing that I think, so that's making the world difference for us, particularly non-res since one reason we have such confidence in that going into the new year, is the way we have built our businesses around corridors. So if we're in Colorado, we're talking about I-25. If we're in Texas, we're talking about I-35. If we're in the Southeast, we're talking about I-85. And these are major commerce corridors and we think will continue to see good residential activity and those markets and we think will continue to see good non-res activity in those markets. I'll tell you, it was comforting to look at best year-on-year increases in homebuilding in student markets like Orlando, where we have a presence, in Charlotte, where we have a presence, and in Houston, where we have a presence. So that's my way of saying, looking at the end users, they all look reasonably healthy to me, they do not look in any respect overbuilt to me. And if there is one place that I would tell you to watch in particular, that's one that works because we think that's going to continue to expand.
Phil Ng: That's great color. What I mean if there was any pocket that should be a little more cautious on would be non-res, and it sounds like you are quite bullish on that backdrop. And I guess for 2020, I think implicit in your full-year guidance for aggregates volumes implies 4Q volumes would track closer to low-single digit growth. Did you see any pull forward in 3Q or anything notable that could be a drag on the fourth quarter?
Howard Nye: Let me turn that to Jim. We did see some modest, but the other thing that we're doing, just before I turn it over to Jim is, we said coming into the year, we thought it'd be a wetter than usual year, we're betting on a normal to early winter as well. So with that backdrop, let me turn it to Jim.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, I think we've got anecdotal evidence that while the customers are trying to rush to beat winter and so particularly in our more northern districts and divisions. So we do have some anecdotal views evidence that that's happening, they pulled some work into Q3 from Q4.
Phil Ng: Okay, but there is nothing outside of that, that would kind of bog you down in the fourth quarter because your comps, I think was not terrible, but it's probably fair to kind of bake in some conservatism because your shorter months are always tough to predict. Is that a good way to think about it?
Howard Nye: If you think about it, the two businesses, in particular in the third quarter, that really did 1% aggregates volumes were the Mideast in the Midwest. So we're talking in those contexts, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska and those are all parts of the country that can seasonally be much more impacted by an early winter. So we're just mindful of what that could be.
Phil Ng: Okay, thanks for the color. Really appreciate it.
Howard Nye: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Adrian Huerta: Thank you and congrats on the results. My question was somewhat related to the previous one. So you kind of answered that one. So, my other question was just on cash taxes. If you're still expecting cash taxes to be somewhere around $90 million for the year and where they were so far in the first nine months of the year? Thank you, Howard.
Howard Nye: You bet. I'll turn to Jim over the cash taxes. He has got a tax background about that.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, I think you're pretty close to spot on, Adrian. So I think that's the right number, low to mid-90s for 2019.
Adrian Huerta: Perfect.
Jim Nickolas: The second question -- I couldn't remember…
Adrian Huerta: No, that was -- that was basically the first one was also on potentially conservative guidance in 4Q. But given what you have just said that they were probably projects that that were advanced into 3Q and that's what is going for the conservative fourth quarter. So, thank you.
Jim Nickolas: You're welcome.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Adrian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. And we will move on to our next question from Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Michael Wood: Hi, good morning. First, I just wanted to ask about our cement and asphalt prices being down sequentially if you could give us more color on that?
Howard Nye: Well, actually, what I would say is, cement pricing was really, it was down sequentially only because of mix issues because we actually sold less into West Texas in oil well this quarter than we did previously, and one thing that I would call out and this is something, Michael, that I'm really happy to see, pricing actually did quite well in the South, meaning that the central part of Texas for us if we look over that period of time that we've owned these assets, Midlothian pricing has always frankly outperformed Hunter, and again, I feel very good about what we see in North Texas. What I liked in this particular quarter is I'm seeing good solid performance in the South as well. So I think that's notable. With respect to -- were you talking about hot mix or were you talking about ready mix pricing? I want to make sure I'm addressing your next question appropriately, Michael.
Michael Wood: I was talking about ready mix.
Howard Nye: Okay. I thought so. You said -- I think you've said hot mix, but I thought you meant ready mix. Here's the deal on ready mix and it's easy to sort out, our volume was nicely up for the quarter, our volume is up for the quarter 12% in the Southwest and it was up about 1.5% in the Rocky Mountains, and here's what that means. You've got a fairly notable geographic mix difference between the Southwest ready mix and the Rocky Mountain ready mix and by that, I mean about $30 per cubic yard difference and Rocky Mountain ready mix is simply a higher priced product. So when we're selling more ready mix in Texas as we were in this instance, the geographic mix that we've experienced will just give you frankly optically a lower ASP, that's the primary driver of what you're seeing. There was a modest mix relative to where we were selling as well. If you go back to the beginning of the year, Michael, you'll recall that we've said we were going to plan for a wetter than usual year and part of what our team looked at is if we're going to plan for a wetter than usual year, what are the different end uses particularly in ready mix that we can be more aligned with, that are not as sensitive to rain? And frankly, homebuilding is one of those. So we ended up pushing modestly more ready mix to homebuilding in Texas and that tends to have a little bit lower ASP as well. So if we look at what's going on, was it driven by the fact that there was simply more ready mix in Texas than there was in Colorado? Yes. Was it driven by the fact that we pivoted modestly to having more residential? Yes. But here's the important thing, at the end of the day, Michael, we made more money, and that's really what all those moves were about for us. So I wanted to give you the underlying specifics on what was happening with ASP. But I also wanted to say, at the end of the day, this is about creating higher returns for shareholders and stakeholders and that's what we did.
Michael Wood: Great, that's helpful. And then on the Magnesia Specialties business, is the inventory destock ended? Is that a multi-quarter destock? If you can give us more color on that. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Yes, I think it is. It's winding its way down. I think we anticipate that will continue in full up and that's in large part what we tried to do with the take-down in the guidance. So it's not an issue that we have long-term concerns about. As you will see, the team in Magnesia, really when they saw a modest slowdown, adjusted their cost profile very, very quickly. So to see that type of movement and actually see margins go up in that business is really a wonderful sign. So I would encourage you if you have running lights on anything, certainly don't have them on Magnesia Specialties, that business is sitting in a good place, it just has to work through some of the inventory issues that we do not see as long term at all.
Michael Wood: Great, thank you.
Howard Nye: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you could talk about how pricing cadence played out over the course of the quarter. I think we typically see you folks later on price increases over the course of the third quarter. Is that how it played out this year? Or was it more front-end loaded? Any color that you can share with us on the cadence would be helpful.
Howard Nye: No, sure Jerry, you know, what -- they're really, as we've talked over the course of the year, they're willing enough, then that'd be mid-year price increases. So, I think much of it was just driven by more volume and where some of the volume is coming from and the normal price increases that we would have. Now clearly, I'm not encouraging you to go and bake in a consistent 9% increase in the West. If you could, I mean that was the very impressive pricing performance in those driven by a couple of things. One, we do have good pricing in Colorado, and as we've discussed over the last several years, that's a marketplace that as we look at our overall footprint tends to have lower aggregates pricing and we think we should get good value for that product than we are. If we look at what's happening in the Southwest, we did move more stone by rail and moving them into higher priced sales yards and what I would say is, I think that's actually a good sign. I think it's a good sign for a number of reasons. One, that tells you the Central Texas is getting healthier, number one, but you see other thing that it says that the railroads are performing better too. I mean, one thing that I think is notably different this year versus last is we would have had a series of conversations last year around rail performance and how that was looking and you have not heard that this year and as we look at the year, we're probably going to send something in the range of mid-30 million tons by rail in the United States this year and I think that's probably 2x our next closest competitor. So, that clearly helped on the pricing side of it as well. And we did see some reasonable yard activity in Florida. So I would tell you those were the primary issues that I would call out for you with respect to pricing, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay, I appreciate the color. And then any mix difference versus normal seasonality? So if we look at over the past 10 years, your heritage pricing is typically up $0.20 sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter. So if that dynamic plays out this year, your pricing cadence exiting the year will be up 6%, just the way the math works out. Is that something that you expect to play out under normal seasonality? Or are there any moving pieces from, I think that we should keep in mind?
Howard Nye: I guess what I would say, is this, if you're trying to just look at Q3 ASP and you're trying to sort through what all the mix issues, are instead of being modestly over five, it probably would have been modestly over four, that's probably just a pure straight up same on same type comparison Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then in terms of the 2020 pricing conversations, we're hearing from a couple of your competitors that those discussions for some are happening earlier in the season, where considering as you pointed out earlier on the call how strong volume growth has been this year. So within the mid-single digit range obviously that you spoke about for '20, that could be a really wide range. It does sound like pricing is accelerating into '20 and I'm just wondering if you can comment on what have been the magnitude of price increases that you've announced so far and obviously, we'll see what they'll stick, but it sounds like the price ask is higher in '20 than what it's been over the past couple of years in terms of percent increase.
Howard Nye: No. Jerry, I think that's probably right. The only one that I'm really willing to talk to in specific dollar terms is what I've spoken to relative to cement at the $8. Obviously, the aggregates can move pretty considerably depending on where you are and what the product mix is going to be. So again, we'll give you more specifics on that as we come into the new year, but if your premise is more people are having more conversations earlier and the numbers sound generally higher, I would agree with all of those basic premises.
Jerry Revich: Okay, thank you. And Howard, lastly, maybe we can talk about cement pricing, specifically you folks have done much better than the market over the past couple of years. But for the market as a whole, it's been really disappointing pricing actions, I'd say for the past really two-plus years. Are you more optimistic that the market will be more disciplined in cement overall heading into next year? And any data points that drive the confidence around the price increase that you had mentioned you had announced in cement?
Howard Nye: Well, I again -- I think when I go back and refer you back to the backlog numbers that I gave you before on where cement sits today versus where it sat last year, I think that certainly gives us confidence around it. If we look at the sheer quantum of infrastructure work in Texas, that gives us confidence around it as well. And the other thing to keep in mind is we're not a nationwide cement player, we're Texas cement player and we're the largest producer of cement in a market that will likely have more need for cement than it can produce in Texas. And we think that's a fine recipe for success in that state.
Jerry Revich: Okay, I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.
Howard Nye: You bet. Take care, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute.
Garik Shmois: Can you hear me? I'm sorry.
Howard Nye: Garik, we hear you now. Yes.
Garik Shmois: Okay, I'm sorry about that. So I was wondering on nonresidential looking out to 2020, you talked about energy projects being potential source of acceleration, but you saw really good growth this year in data warehouses and I'm understanding that you've set up your asset footprint along some of these high-growth non-res corridors. So I was wondering if you could speak to that end market in particular into next year and maybe a little bit more broadly, if you're expecting any change in the non-res composition of growth into 2020 by end market?
Howard Nye: Garik, thanks for the question. I think it can move around a little bit and I think it can vary. We've seen all through attractive wind farm activity this year in Iowa. I think we might start seeing more of that type of activity farther south next year. I think what we continue to see warehousing will be very, very healthy, and I think the warehouse and in particular is what's going to drive a good number of our volumes in those markets, Garik. I mean what you've seen relative to warehousing in places like Indianapolis and even in areas such as the [indiscernible] has been really pretty impactful to our business and we think it will continue to be, it goes back to the observation you made at the premise of your question, and that is if you build your business along these high corridors, you're going to see good non-res growth, and again, Garik, we think that's going to be very healthy in 2020.
Garik Shmois: Okay, thanks. And then just lastly on the outlook. It's tough to handicap. But if you think about infrastructure, we get that a lot of the visibility that you have is based on the awards that have occurred really over the last several years, but we're getting some more questions just on recession threat and what would happen if there is not a timely extension or passage of a new highway bill. So is there any contemplation about any potential disruptions on the federal side and how that might impact infrastructure demand etcetera?
Howard Nye: I will tell you; I hear very little to nothing about a recession threat from the federal side at all. I don't see it. And I think the other thing that everyone that I speak to in Washington, not only representatives of people to trade associations come away with the view that the notion of short-term CRs is not a place that anyone wants to be, and everyone understands that this is a much needed area of consistent investment. So we're not seeing things in our dialogs, and we stay very close to us -- very close to it. That gives us a sense of that's going to end up being an issue next year, Garik.
Garik Shmois: Great, thanks so much.
Howard Nye: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks Howard for all that great color. And only things I had left that I was hoping for a little bit more detail on was since you mentioned that M&A is your top priority for use of cash, if you could characterize the environment and the opportunities that you might have this?
Howard Nye: Timna, thanks for the question. It is always a very active dialog. I mean, the question is how far is to go beyond the dialog and what does the acquisition look like in a relative state because different acquisitions are going to have different levels of attractiveness to us. What I will tell you is the dialog that is underway with businesses directly and in some instances the dialog is underway with people who are representing businesses tends to be a very active dialog and where that leads, I can't predict right now, but it has continued to be a very consistent positive thoughtful dialog and part of what I like Timna is, as Jim indicated, through our deleveraging, we're in a very good place today and I think from the perspective of, what we believe we can do from a regulatory perspective, we're in a very attractive place as well, and we like to think that's from a competitive viewpoint something that actually works in our favor.
Timna Tanners: Okay, super. And then the only other question I had was on SG&A, you raised the guidance. Just wondering if you could just give us some color on that to help us think about the future.
Jim Nickolas: Yes, hey, Timna, it's Jim. That's predominantly personnel expense, made up of a few things, like going labor inflation standard, some incentive compensation given the outperformance of the business and a few IT initiatives as well.
Timna Tanners: Okay, super. Thanks again.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Rohit Seth: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just on the infrastructure, you said the volumes dropped 7% [ph] in non-transportation projects and reconstruction in the Midwest. Just tell us where you're seeing the strength in the transportation side? And then if you can talk about, what's actually happening in the Midwest with the reconstruction efforts?
Howard Nye: Rohit, I think part of what you run into the Midwest is every year when they go through bad freestyle [ph], you still have more roads in the Midwest that tend to be far-to-market type roads, that tend to be gravel roads, and so what you'll see after winter is a fairly significant need to repair those roads. What's happened this year is you had the freestyle, you had winter, you had repair needs, and then you actually had repair needs that were so acute also driven by the flooding that it tended to go much more deeply into the year than it typically does. So what I would say is, you've got traditional paving projects in that part of the world that you would expect to see year-in and year-out. And then we've seen considerably more just raw maintenance activity in that part of the United States because of some of the flooding situations that we saw last year, and by the way, that plays into part of what we've seen in the ChemRock/Rail piece of the business as well. I mean if you look at that, you will also see that I talked about the fact that ChemRock/Rail shipments were up 4% for the quarter and that was really led by ballast shipments, I didn't say it in my prepared comments, but the fact is, it's really into the Western United States and that ties very directly back into that part of the country that you're asking about right now.
Rohit Seth: Okay. And then on the transportation projects, what states we're seeing strength?
Howard Nye: The fact is, we're seeing strength in almost all of our top 10 states. And if you go back to it and you think about what we discussed relative to those state DOT budgets and what they have done with their spending or investment levels over the last several years, it's been pretty considerable. I mean. Texas is 37% of our revenue. And if we look at what their project awards have looked like and where Prop [ph] 7 is kicking in and Prop [ph] 1, and these are big numbers and then the other thing that we're seeing there is the return of a very significant design build projects. Colorado, as I indicated before, has had very active bidding activity in that state. We're actually seeing a proposition. It's called Proposition CC in that state, it could actually raise more than $10 billion for transportation over the next 15 years. Georgia DOT has lettings at $2 billion, which is 2x where it was in 2014. So these are all the types of initiatives that we've seen in our top 10 states that I think has these states outperforming the nation as a whole right now, and probably for the foreseeable future.
Rohit Seth: Okay. And then, just building on that ARTBA question earlier. Does it surprise you that the project flow has been more -- has been very lumpy and perhaps there's been less large projects coming to the market than we've seen in the past?
Howard Nye: No, it doesn't. Because I think if you look at the nature of some of these jobs, you're going to have that degree of lumpiness and one of the things that I think is important is, as I indicated in response to the earlier question, what does the trend look like on a multiyear basis? And the other thing is, if you talk to the people at ARTBA, they too would tell you we're not surprised by this. This is the type of activity that we would expect and it's the type of longer term dynamics that we're looking for that we actually think are helpful on as well.
Rohit Seth: Got you. So you have the view that maybe 2020 the ARTBA awards probably move back in a positive direction?
Howard Nye: Well, again, if I'm looking at where awards are, and I'm looking at about where they are from 2017 levels and I'm thinking about the business over multiple years, again, they're 13% above 2017 levels. I mean, I think if you go back and charted Seth, what you'll find is something that's not going to be [indiscernible] to you, again, I think breaking down what's highways and what's bridges and then sorting out aggregates intensity is an important part of that conversation.
Rohit Seth: All right. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. Thank you. And we will move on to our next question from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Howard Nye: And we hear you.
Adam Thalhimer: Great. I wanted to ask first and sorry if I missed this, I hopped on late, but the Southeast Group with volumes up 1%, what would that have been ex the hurricane. And then just some high-level thoughts on just core demand in the Southeast.
Howard Nye: Yes, really the Southeast had a relatively tough comp, that's your bigger issue there. I would not put too much stock into what happened this quarter with Dorian in the Southeast or Imelda, I mean Dorian interrupted a few days. It obviously shut down production in the Bahamas, and we've been working with our team there to make sure their lives are in order, and oddly enough Dorian the same storm that knocked around the Bahamas actually found its way before it was done up to Nova Scotia as well. But -- and I would look at the Southeast and say that was really more driven by a tough comp than anything else going on. I wouldn't describe significant Dorian effect to that.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then, on high level on private construction Howard, does it feel like private is still good everywhere or do you think it's -- are we at a point where some geographies are really, really good and some geographies have started to slow?
Howard Nye: Yes, I guess I'm going back to my earlier commentary, I don't see places that are overbuilt and I think that's a really important place to start. I think the other thing that I would point you to is if you're looking at the Dodge Momentum Index or the ABI, I mean part of what you'll see is for example in the ABI, the South and the South in the ABI is a big swath of territory, that's going from the Atlantic Coast to Texas. So you think about the ABI's South region, that's going to be a big piece of our business, it has consistently been a leader in the way the ABI has looked at. It's also been a leader in the way we looked at it through the DMI. So I think your point is a good one Adam and that is not all markets are created equal and some markets are better than others. And part of what we have tried to do and we outlined it in the prepared remarks is put ourselves very intentionally in markets that we feel like in every cycle will outperform and I think that's what we've done and I think that's what we're seeing in the volume numbers. And I think that's one reason that we have such confidence in non-res and [indiscernible] population trends are moving in those directions; we see big projects coming and we see steady medium projects ahead of us as well.
Adam Thalhimer: Great. Okay, thanks Howard.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines and I'd like to turn the conference back over to Howard Nye for any closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Well, again, thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Our proven strategic plan and commitment to operational excellence and world-class attributes of our business position Martin Marietta for continued growth and enhance shareholder value, as we continue to benefit from the steady construction recovery. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program; you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Catherine, and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I will now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta’s second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today’s discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2019 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the second quarter 2019 and the comparisons of versus the prior year second quarter, and all margin references are based on revenues. When providing certain comparisons with prior periods, we have excluded the operating results of acquired businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. We refer to these comparisons as same store information. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q2 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today’s earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our second quarter operating performance as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We're proud to report second quarter results that established new company records for revenues, gross profit and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, driven by double digit aggregate shipments growth, continued pricing momentum across our building materials business and improve cost control. Consolidated total revenues increased 6% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA to $378 million and fully diluted earnings per share to $3.01. This impressive second quarter performance underscores Martin Marietta strong execution and superior strategic position, which are allowing us to capitalize on the strength of product demand in our key regions. Attractive market fundamentals including notable employment gains, population growth and superior state fiscal health continued to promote steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing trends across our geographic footprint in the second quarter. Consistent with our expectations, construction growth in our top 10 states is outpacing the nation as a whole. We anticipate further acceleration in construction activity during the second half of this year, supported by strength in public and private sector spending. These attractive dynamics combined with our strong first half performance position Martin Marietta for increased shipments, pricing and profitability and underpinned our confidence that we will deliver another record year. That's why it's announced in today's release, we raise the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $32.5 million. Our second quarter results can best be summarized as a tale of two geographies. Much of Martin Marietta's Eastern footprint, most notably North Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, as well as Iowa benefited from robust underlying demand, his customers continued to address whether deferred projects and growing backlogs. By contrast, the company's two largest states by revenues, Texas and Colorado, experienced extreme weather patterns during the quarter that hindered construction activity and negatively impacted our aggregates, cement and downstream operations in these regions. Aggregate shipments increased 10% for the company as a whole or 6% on a same store basis. All divisions achieved growth with the exception of our Southwest division, which had relatively flat shipping volumes. Equally important for second consecutive quarter, we saw improved shipments across all three of our primary induce markets. Aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2% as contractors advanced transportation related projects. However, major infrastructure initiatives in Texas and Colorado were delayed due to weather, thereby limiting overall gains in the quarter. We expect public construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year, supported by meaningful increases in lettings and contract awards in a number of our key states, notably Texas, Colorado and Maryland. And continued funding from the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act. We're encouraged by the two year budget deal that was reached last week in Washington DC. With that agreement now in place, we believe federal transportation funding will continue at a minimum at status quo levels. That's even absent the perspective passage of a successor infrastructure bill prior to the FAST Act's September 2020 expiration, an area the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is currently making progress. This should provide the necessary confidence and structure for states to continue to move planned and future construction projects forward. Additionally, our top 10 states which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. State level funding is expected to continue to grow at a faster rate than federal funding in the near term, leading to additional growth opportunities for our company. The infrastructure market represented 37% of our second quarter aggregate shipments, which was below the company's most recent 10 year annual average of 46%. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market increased 25% with strength in distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, Iowa and Maryland. Additionally, we're benefiting from the reemergence of large energy sector projects along the Texas Gulf Coast. Looking ahead and consistent with third party forecasts, including the Dodge Momentum Index, our non-residential outlook remains positive, and projects healthy commercial construction activity, particularly in our southeastern and southwestern regions. The non-residential market represented 37% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. Aggregate shipments to the residential market increased modestly with attractive home building activity in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida offset by weather impacted delays in Texas. Despite the recent decline and housing unit starts at the national level, we expect residential construction will continue to grow within Martin Marietta's geographic footprint driven by favorable population demographics, jobs growth, land availability, attractive mortgage rates and efficient permitting. In our view, the issuance of residential permits represents the best indicator of future housing construction activity. Currently, permit growth for our top 10 states is outpacing the national average for both multifamily and single family housing units. The residential market accounted for 21% of aggregate shipments. To conclude our discussion on end use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5% of aggregate shipments. Volumes increased to 11% driven by improved fellowship to the western Class I railroads for emergency flood repairs, notably in Colorado and the Midwest. Based on our year-to-date performance and current trends, we also raised our full year aggregate shipment guidance from an increase of 6% to 8% to an increase of 8% to 10%. In line with internal expectations, aggregates pricing improved 3.4%. On a same store basis, pricing improved 4.1%. As a reminder, selling prices for operations required during the second quarter of 2018 are approximately 15% below the company's overall average. Our goal is to move pricing for these operations to be more in line with our broader company's selling prices. By region, our Southeast Group achieve same store price and growth of 8%, reflecting strong underlying demand in North Georgia, and a higher percentage of long haul shipments from our higher price distribution terminals. Continued discipline but the aggregate pricing improvements of 3% for both the West Group and the Mid-America Group when compared on the same store basis. We expect overall pricing growth to accelerate throughout the remainder of 2019, now that a significant portion of prior year whether different projects have rolled off our backlogs and implemented price increases are realized. Cement shipments declined 5%, driven by extreme precipitation in Texas, most significantly in Dallas Fort Worth, our pricing improved 5%. Underlying demand and the bidding pipeline remained robust and we believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from the tight supply in Texas. Turning to our downstream businesses. Despite growing customer backlogs, ready mix concrete shipments decreased nearly 16% as unfavorable weather conditions in Texas and Colorado hindered construction activity in these days. Pricing improved 3% following annual price increases that became effective on April 1. Our asphalt and paving business, which operates solely in Colorado experienced reduced production days from persistent extreme weather, including unseasonable May snowball, resulting in an 8% reduction in asphalt shipments. Asphalt pricing improved 5%, reflecting strong bidding activity and customer confidence. We believe it will be challenging for our downstream businesses, particularly in Colorado to holding makeup weather deferred shipments in the second half of the year, given the remaining available operating days in the calendar year and the typical seasonal constraints. However, we expect any weather deferred work not completed over the balance of 2019 will be pushed into 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss the specifics of our second quarter financial results.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you Ward. The building materials business achieved record quarterly products and services revenues of $1.1 billion, a 6% increase and gross profit of $328 million, a 14% increase. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 340 basis points to 33%. This margin expansion was driven by improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels, combined with pricing gains and the absence of the headwind from selling acquired inventory burdened by acquisition accounting in 2018. For the full year 2019, at the raised guidance levels, we still expect aggregates incremental margins on a same store basis to exceed our 60% target. Moving now to cement. For the second quarter, despite the nearly 5% decrease in shipments, cement product gross margin of 37.6% increased 110 basis points, driven by improve pricing, production efficiencies and lower maintenance costs. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from a solid global domain for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million and product gross profit of $29 million, both quarterly records. Payroll product mix, production efficiencies and lower energy costs contributed to the 500 basis point expansion of product gross margin to 41.5%. Our consolidated results included a $16 million out of pure expense to correct the overstatement of equity earnings from a non-consolidated affiliate in prior periods. This pretax non-cash adjustment was recorded in other non-operating expenses net and as a non-recurring item. Looking ahead, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $165 million higher than in 2018. We will use the resulting increase in discretionary cash flow for the continued execution of a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on creating shareholder value through value enhancing acquisitions, proven organic capital investment, and the opportunistic deployment of free cash flow through shared purchases and dividends, all well returning to a target leverage ratio. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million as we invest in highly term projects. These projects are predominantly geared towards generating greater efficiencies to drive continued margin expansion, though some are specifically focused on increasing targeted capacity. In May, we declared our 100th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. We are proud to be the only public company in our industry to have never reduced or suspended our dividend payments over this time. A testament to our consistent focus and balance sheet strength and operational excellence. Additionally, we returned $50 million to shareholders through the purchase of 230,400 shares of common stock. These shares were repurchased at an approximate price of $215 per share. Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February, 2015, we've returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, as well as meaningful and sustainable dividends. Our ratio of consolidate net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our applicable credit agreement was 2.7 times for the trailing 12 months ended June, 2019. While this remains modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio, we expect to continue deleveraging was an anticipated return to our target leverage ratio up to 2.5 times by the end of the third quarter. As details in today’s release, we raised our full year 2019 guidance to reflect our strong first-half performance and current trends. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues to range from $4.535 billion to $4.730 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range $1.200 billion to $1.350 billion. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Jim, thanks. To conclude, we’re extremely pleased with our second quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019. During our 25 years as a public company, Martin Marietta has responsibly managed and grown our business to create long term shareholder value.

The operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Ward, Jim and Suzanne.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Trey.
Trey Grooms: I guess first for me, you mentioned that, clearly the cement business volume impacted by weather in the quarter, but pricing was still very good, which indicating strong underlying demand. And I guess the same can be said for ready mix and hot mixed asphalt as well. But can you talk a little bit about, the weather impact what that might have had in the quarter to volume, especially in cement? But then also and I guess more importantly, how you’re performing and what you’re seeing out there since July looks like it’s the weather is finally starting to cooperate a little bit better for you guys, can kind of talk about what you’re seeing there, especially in the cement business?
Ward Nye: Trey, thanks for your question. A couple of things. One, if we just look at the second quarter, cement had 15 more days impacted by rain in this quarter than it did last year. To give you a sense of it, that’s about 13 inches of incremental rainfall that we experienced in that Northern and Central Texas area. So that was clearly something that pushed back on the volume. I think your point is actually a very good one. To see volume down and see ASP up 5%, I think it’s a wonderful sign of an underlying marketplace that we think is attractive. There are several observations on that note. One, we did see pricing up nicely in North Texas. We also saw pricing up nicely in Central Texas. So we’re seeing it up at both Midlothian as well as Hunter. So we see what we think is going to be a very busy second half of the year. As you know, typically I don’t call outside of the lines and talk about specific months in the quarter that we’re in right now, I’d like to talk about the quarter that has just concluded. But obviously, we have a great deal of confidence in what have to is going to look like, what else we would not have modified our guidance going forward. More specifically, Trey, if you look at the guidance and see where the moving parts are on that, you’ll see volume growth, as we’ve highlighted in aggregates, but you will also see looking at cement, that we’ve taken up our product revenues and we’ve taken up our gross profit for the business. So I think if you take a look at where pricing is, and what we’ve done relative to our guidance, that does give you a good sense of at least how we viewing have to. The other thing to remember is we did a lot of investment in our tones in the first half of this year. So we also think the cost profile of that business have to look very attractive.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Okay, that – thanks for all that color, Ward, appreciate it. And then I guess as my follow up. You mentioned, I think this is specifically to aggregates that overall pricing that you’re expecting that pricing growth to accelerate to 2019, as some of these older projects roll off, as you kind of play some catch up, I guess with some of that pent up demand. Can you give us any more color about that? I know you reiterated your guide for the full year. But just any sense that you can give us on how what kind of impact that had to maybe the first half pricing and then a way that we can maybe think about that acceleration, kind of going into the back half of the year?
Ward Nye: Sure. Thank you for that, Trey. I guess I would say, do keep in mind, we are seeing hard work roll off, you see what the price increases were. I think the other thing that’s worth noting is if we look at the quarter, actually, we had a very strong quarter in particular, in our Midwest, and Mideast divisions, those are really not two of our overall higher price divisions as you compare them, for example, two parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. So we think we’re likely to see natural price increases come in. We think we’re likely to see some geographic mix that’s going to be in our favor. And one thing I have to say for operating group to as I reflect on that, to have had the type of growth that we did in Midwest and Mideast, to have had a very wet quarter in Texas and Colorado are two largest states by revenue and to put up 63% incremental margins on a same store basis in the quarter, I think it’s a really good story but I think those building blocks I gave you at the beginning of that answer relative to pricing is what gives us confidence in the way the blog will look for the rest of the year.
Trey Grooms: Yeah, make sense. I’ll go ahead and pass it on. Thanks, Ward and congrats on the good quarter.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Just a follow-up cleanup question on guidance and modest revision upwards. Can you look at more clarity on how much higher volumes versus lower costs contributed to that delta, both on the aggregate and on the snip side. And could you also confirm the guidance still includes relatively better weather, as you outlined in the previous quarter? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure. Kathryn, good to hear your voice. A couple of things as we got walk through the guidance. And so to be very granular on it, original guidance on volume growth for aggregates was 6 to 8. Now it’s 8 to 10. So as we’re looking at that, one thing that we just have to recognize is we’ve hit the midpoint of our guidance relative to volumes in half one. So as we look at it, where we think half two is going to be, we think non-residential is going to stay good. We’re seeing nicely continuing recovery in the Southeast. We think infrastructure looks good in multi-year basis and our customers are thinking backlogs. On the last part of the call, I spoke to a degree on cement with respect to Trey’s question, the one thing that we haven’t changed is our view, at least on the 3 to 5 on ASP. So again, the pricing side has stayed static. The only part of our guidance, really, Kathryn that we took down was the guidance relative to our downstream businesses. In large part recognizing that we are planning for a second half wetter than normal, and we’re planning for a normal onset of wetter in the Rocky Mountains. So really, if we take those two factors, and try to determine what the runway just for the rest of the year could look like from a timing perspective on downstream businesses, we’ve tightened that up a bit. Do I think our cost profile will get better? Yeah, I think it could. I think if you look at half one, the cost profile actually looks pretty good. I think if we look at cost in cement, clearly, we have done a lot of what we would do on those. I think our labor costs are very nicely controlled. I think if you look at where we sit relative to costs with respect to fuel and otherwise today. That’s been a pretty good story, we think it’ll stay that way. If we look year-to-date, just for diesel fuel, June expenses were down 1.5 million lower than prior year, that’s for the first six months on five point more – 5.4% more gallons. So keep in mind, we’re going to have a full year of Bluegrass in fuel numbers. Again, for your quick use, we used about 47.5 million gallons last year. I think our MNR can look pretty good in the second half. If you look at what we have done relative to CapEx over the last several years, that should continue to be a very good story on our cost profile. You know what said when you put in that group CapEx, what it can do to DD&A is push that up very modestly, as you work those costs off overtime. But Kathryn, if you’re looking at labor, you look at DD&A, maintenance and repair and energy. You’ve worked through close to 30% of your costs on labor, and then at heavier costs at 15% after that, and given what we think can be the volume leverage, we think cost profile can again be very attractive. I hope that color was helpful.
Kathryn Thompson: Yeah. Shifting to the policy side, I know that we as a firm, spend a lot of time on DOTs, you are seeing some good learning from that, it’s good to see. But maybe shifting to the focus in DC, given yesterday’s EPW meeting, and Mr. President’s tweet earlier this morning on potential progress, not that we really want to focus on that. But what are your thoughts in terms of realistically, what’s going on in DC for long term highlight? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. I guess a couple of things. I mentioned in my prepared comments, two things. I mentioned, the bipartisan two year agreement that was basically met last week, which we thought was encouraging. And that’s what gives us confidence around in a worst case scenario, something that feels like flat on infrastructure actually liked very much again, I referenced this in the prepared comments what EPW did yesterday. So you’ve got a republican controlled environment and Public Works Committee and the Senate, that’s basically authorizing a 27% increase in transportation spending. That’s notable. The thing to remember is Kathryn, historically, the way that this works and reauthorization process is usually it’s kicked to the house in the first instance. And the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee looks at this comes out with their view of the bill and then Senator EPW comes in afterward. I think the fact that the republican controlled senate and EPW has come up with a nice increase on what they’re calling America’s Transportation Infrastructure Act, in the first instance, is really attractive for what we may watch for coming out of House T&I. You know and I know that the real debate is going to be around, what would the pay for look like? I believe the debate around pay will be divided somewhere between varying degrees of user fees, whether it be truck rates, whether it be electric car batteries or otherwise, or fuel gas taxes. I don’t think it’s going to be any one of those. I think it’s going to be an array of those. I think we’ll have good policy. The debate is going to be around what funding is going to be, but I think we have a President who would like to see it. We clearly have a democratic congress that would like to see it. And we have a republican control EPW that has come out with what we feel like it’s a very good start. We don’t think that’s a bad place to be here as we enter have to this year.
Kathryn Thompson: All right. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is open.
Scott Schrier: Hi, good morning and nice quarter. I wanted to start on a downstream strategy. If I look at the cement internal and external shipment dynamics, is there anything to look into or read into there? You had pretty good pricing, does that mean that makes more sense to sell more externally and hold off on some of the internal sales? Obviously, concrete margins were pretty light. I got it, there was some fixed costs, absorption. But if I think about, I mean you’re looking at some of these fundamentals, how much of a need for the expanse of network of ready mix, do you actually need? And then, similar, if we look at ready mix pricing is up 2.5% year-on-year roughly the same sequentially, given cement price moves, given aggregates price moves and labor. I would have looked for more, so also, is it competition there, the Colorado verse Texas dynamics, how do you think about material spread? So I know it kind of packed up a little bit there but any color you could give that would be appreciated?
Ward Nye: You know you bet. Scott, I guess several things, one, looking at margins in cement that are in the mid to high 30s to something will take every day. So that’s a business that actually performed well in the quarter when I think if somebody was saying what’s this cement business is simply going to look like in a wet second quarter in Texas. I’m not sure if people would have thought it would have looked that good. I think the ready mix business, basically looking at the weather that they had in Texas, actually performed reasonably well. I do like the fact that you’re seeing the ASPs go up. Are you seeing ASPs go up more quickly in a market like Colorado, than you are in a marketplace like Texas? The answer is yes. But equally were the markets in Texas that were hit hardest by rain, specific North Texas and around DFW, some of our higher priced ready mix markets, the answer to that question is equally, yes. So again, if we look at the position that we have in Texas, we are the largest producer of aggregates, we are the largest producer of cement and we’re the leading ready mix producer. But again, we focus that in a very intentional fashion in that large Texas triangle, we feel like that’s a – that market is built in a vertically integrated fashion. We’re a leader in that market and we’ve been able to as we go through cycles to extract value all the way through our product offerings in that marketplace. So what I would suggest to you is much of what you’re looking at relative to the downstream businesses in Q2 was a weather event driven circumstance. I think cement performed in that – in that marketplace extraordinarily well. And again, I would take you back to the ASPs, seeing ASPs up 3 and ready mix with volume down 16. Actually, I think that tells you the story on what the underlying demand looks like. And we do like our position all the way through the products in that state, Scott.
Scott Schrier: Great. Ward, thanks for that. Good color. My follow-up, I wanted to move back to the aggregates and specifically in the Southeast. Obviously, you’re seeing nice pricing growth from the long haul shipment, you have volumes coming back. I’m wondering if you could speak to the margin profile you’re seeing in those regions. I know in the past, you’ve had a chart that basically showed the Southeast was further from peak levels of profitability, then some of your more legacy assets. So can you talk about what you’re seeing from a logistics perspective and rail overwater? And how much – the efficiencies that you’re getting and how you look at the potential to grow that region in terms of margin and profit dollars?
Ward Nye: No, sure, Scott, I’ll do that. And keep in mind, we have to be careful because we can have terms of art when we speak to the Southeast and we can have just normal conversational tones of what we mean when we’re talking about the Southeast to United States. So I think at times people are looking at our Southeast business. At times, they’re looking at the bottom right hand corner of the map of the United States. But I would say is this, and let’s talk about the bottom right hand corner of the map of the United States, because I think that’s how people think of that business. If we’re looking at North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida in particular, those are states that overtime, we would have expected some of the most attractive if not the single most attractive margins that we would see in our business. Clearly, you’re seeing I say, ASP rise in the Southeastern United States, in part because to your point, if you look at Georgia and North Carolina, in particular have been, they’re still around 28-ish percent below mid cycle on volumes, but they’ve not behave from a pricing perspective, is it that they’re that far off on volumes. So what we’re seeing in this quarter for an example, is we’re seeing places like Greensboro in North Carolina, recovering in a very nice way for literally about the first time in a decade. We think that’s incredibly important as Raleigh been in recovery mode, it has been has Charlotte been yes. Has Greensboro lag it has, and it’s doing noticeably better now. Yes, equally Atlanta coming out of the recession, Atlanta, as you recall, Scott, was hit disproportionately hard. Atlanta send a very nice recovery mode now on both public and private work. And if we look at Georgia DOT budget today is really considerably more attractive than it was several years ago. But if we’re looking at some very large projects that are likely to be led in that marketplace over the next several years, we think that’s important. It’s probably worth looking at some point of major mobility investment program that George is looking at and targeting around $12 billion to reduce congestion along key carter’s in that state. So I think back to your question. If you’re looking at the Southeastern United States, we think the recovery is early, we think the recovery is notable. And I think your observation that you’re not hearing us had broad based concerns around rail performance is notable. I mean, obviously we saw good performance from the railroads in the Western U.S. in the first half and we continue to have good service from the railroads in the east. We think all that pretends very well for that Southeastern portion of our business.
Scott Schrier: Thanks for that. Appreciate it and good luck.
Ward Nye: You bet, Scott. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Phil Ng: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Ward, strong quarter, pretty impressed in this tough environment.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Phil.
Phil Ng: Sure. It seems like the bottlenecks that you saw last year whether it’s rail and labor trying to clear up. Is that fair and you know, what’s your ability to kind of play catch up in the back half? And I’m just curious do you and your customers, how the bandwidth is for, stronger demand. Is there like a governor on terms of how fast shipments could be up this year?
Ward Nye: You know couple of things, one, I think you’re entirely right. Part of what we said last year was we thought logistics would get better. We thought trucking would get better, and we thought rail would get better. And we didn’t think it would be cured over a quarter, but we thought it would be cured over the course of several quarters. And I’m not saying it’s cured, but we are saying it’s considerably better. So I think what we have learned in that respect is about right. With respect to labor, I’m going to bifurcated that and I’m going to speak to it in two halves. The first half is what does our labor look like? Do we have the capacity in most instances to put the stone on the ground that’s required for projects, including wrap up? The short answers yeah, I think we do. I think we could certainly do that. Is there a governor at times in certainly markets relative to contract labor, I think to a degree in some markets, if you have a higher degree of seasonality in a market, you can have some of that today? It’s odd to look at it and see volume up 10%. And be talking about a governor because we actually like what we saw in the quarter. We like what we’ve seen in the first half, we think it’s going to be a very busy second half. We are not going to be labor constrained. In our side of the equation, it will see how hard contractors can run. I will tell you; I think contractors are doing a considerably better job of putting material down when they can. I think the last several years of being extremely wet. We have pushed contractors to adjust their schedules, and we see them overcoming bottlenecks in ways in 2019, that I don’t think we would have seen in 2017. Now to the extent that they can’t get all the work done that they would like to in 2019, the good news is I think it gets pushed into 2020. So I think we’re looking at something that we’ve already captioned is going to be a record year this year. And I like how much build I see at this point going into 2020.
Phil Ng: Got it. That’s really helpful color. And then the growth that you saw in non-residential was impressive. I think you’re seeing double-digit growth, and you’re calling for a pretty noticeable uptick for the rest of the year. It sounds like you’re starting to see some of those energy projects you’ve been talking about into Gulf coming through, one is that correct? And how should we think about this opportunity next few years?
Ward Nye: Okay, thank you for the observation on that. I would say two things. Are we seeing some of the energy projects in the Gulf come through? The answer is yes. I mean, to give you a sense of it we will probably sell a million tons to some of those projects this year. But here’s what I think is more impressive about what we saw the court on non-residential, and that was it was broad based. If we’re looking at the Southwest, the mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Mideast, the Southeast, they were all up on non-res. So we’re not saying one big project in one part of the country that’s just soaking up all the noise on non-res. We’re saying good energy activity as I just indicated. We’re seeing reasonable sale activity. We’re seeing continued warehousing activity. We’re seeing large distribution activity. We’re seeing wind farms. We’re seeing datacenters. So part of what I like about non-res is it seems to be fairly widely dispersed. And one of the things that you’ve heard us speak to Phil, is how important we believe it is to grow our businesses on these notable and significant corridors. So on I-25, and I-35 and I-85 and I-95 and interstate 40, all of which are very active quarters for corridors for traffic. We’re seeing notable non-res activity in those corridors and we’re participating in those in ways that we would have expected. So is a 37% overall piece of the pie on non-res notable it is. But we think it’s got some sustainability to it. Based on the numbers that we’re seeing we believe that it does. Again, I want to give you some color there, Phil.
Phil Ng: That’s really helpful. And just one last one, if I may. Your incremental margin guidance implies a noticeable step up. Can you provide a little more color on the key drivers? That gives you that confidence that the full year, it’s tracking – expected track north of the year, longer term 60% target? Thanks, and good luck in quarter.
Jim Nickolas: Yeah, Phil, it’s Jim. So the answer to that is really just continued performance that you’ve seen this year continuing in the second half of this year, coupled with the fact that we’re comparing versus prior second half a very, very weather impacted effect the third and fourth quarter. So really continued good performance, stable performance from our perspective this year, for an easy count for the back half the year.
Ward Nye: And Phil, just as reminder, when we hit 63% in the second quarter with our top two states hit hard by weather and without a big place in the East being really driven by the Midwest and Mid-East, again, I think that underscores Jim’s point, we feel pretty good about where the incrementals are going.
Phil Ng: Okay, thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Just on infrastructure. Clearly your leading indicators are quite positive. But rough about 2% infrastructure in the front half a year to get to your outlook for high single-digits for the full year implies, high single digits…
Ward Nye: Operator, I lost Garik.
Garik Shmois: Hello, can you hear me?
Ward Nye: We can hear you now. We lost you for a second, Garik. You were saying that implies high single digits for the second half. I think it’s what you’re saying?
Garik Shmois: Yeah, I think maybe a little bit more than high single-digit growth in the second half for infrastructure. And, if that is the case, is there any price mix impact, just given the timing of some of the shipments in infrastructure that you might experience?
Ward Nye: Yeah, the only thing that I could say relative to mix is if you do end up with more brand new infrastructure project starting, you could see a higher degree of base move on those. And again, the margins that we would experience some base sales is not going to be notably different than the margin, we might experience some clean. But as you know, you can have a 25% to 30% delta in ASP moving from a base product to a clean stone product. So could you see some bit of that in that? I suppose. Are we concerned that that might do anything to change our guidance? We’re not concerned about that Garik. And I guess the other thing that I would say is we’ve spoken with our customers about their backlogs. That’s really what gives us the competence as we look into have to relative to infrastructure because we’re looking at Mid-Atlantic backlogs that customers would say, from their perspective, or up at times to read 30% if where they were last year, we’re looking at backlogs in the Midwest, where customers are saying they may be up as much as 25% of where they were in the prior year. We’re looking the Southwest same type of activity. Customers are saying they may be up as much as 14%. And when we’re talking to customers in cement, they’re talking about numbers that can even be ahead of those percentages that I just gave you. So if we’re looking at where DOTs are and they are bidding, and what’s happening. And keep in mind, you’ve got $8.7 billion worth and Texas going up to 9.1 next year. Colorado’s got to point $2.2 billion DOT budget this year versus $1.6 billion last year. North Carolina is expecting a record year. We’re looking at Florida at $10.8 billion for FY 2019-2020. And we’re looking at Maryland at the largest P3 Highway project in North America. So if we think about really why we have confidence in the continued emergence of public works, it’s the customer backlogs and it’s the dialogue come in the DOTs that gives us that underlying confidence.
Garik Shmois: Okay. That’s good color, thanks. Other question is just on cement in the maintenance expense, you indicated that you pull forward [Technical Difficulty] how much maintenance you incurred in the second half of 2018 and just [Technical Difficulty]?
Ward Nye: Yeah, look, for the full year 2018, we had, it looks like it’s $14.4 million worth of expenses, we’re looking at $19.2 million worth of expenses this year. And again, the biggest piece of that was front loaded. So we feel like we’re going to be in a very attractive year. We’re $5 million more into killing expense in the first half of this year versus where we were in the last year. So you can take those numbers and get a very good build as you go through.
Garik Shmois: Okay, yeah, sure. Thanks again.
Ward Nye: Okay, thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe you can start by kind of give us an update on thoughts around Bluegrass, you guys have had it for a year anniversary of it. You certainly mentioned Maryland and North Georgia key contributors in the quarter. I’d love to see kind of here rather kind of thoughts around how the integration went, if there were any additional synergy that there were to come out? And I’ll let you take it from there.
Ward Nye: Stanley thanks for the question. I guess several things. One, this was in fact the finest quarter that we’ve had with Bluegrass since it’s been under our ownership. We saw nice incremental tonnage for the quarter. We’ve seen nice incremental tonnage for the first half. We exceeded all the synergy targets that we projected. And remember Stanley, this energy targets, we projected we’re operating synergy target. So I’d like to say we’re getting those the hard way. We think culturally, we have brought a business into our business that has worked extraordinarily well. So for example, I’m really very proud to tell you that through the first half of the year, there were no last time insurance at any Bluegrass site. And that’s a very different story than it was last year. And you recall, that’s the same type of story that we had after we had acquired TXI. So are we pleased with much larger position, particularly in Atlanta than then we had before? Yeah, we are. Do we feel like that positions is particularly well, as we start thinking about what Georgia DOT will do over the next several years on that major mobility investment program? Yeah, we do. Being in Maryland, for you got the largest P3 activity in the country. And we think is an exciting place to be. And I will tell you a couple of weeks ago, I was looking through the Bluegrass operations in Kentucky that has fit very nicely into our Southern Ohio Business. Very good people, very good operations, doing everything that we thought it would do. So yes, we’re very pleased with every aspect of that. I did give some commentary in my prepared remarks on our views on what we think we would like to be able to do commercially with that business going forward and we will continue to be focused on that.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. And then, one last one, I guess, maybe for you to kind of think about CapEx stand run rate for the business. You mentioned some pretty spectacular, pretty significant increases on some of the backlog for some of your customer work. When we think about CapEx remaining at this level on a go forward basis and then two, kind of how do you think about managing the debt levels into next year, primarily, since you’re going to be way through that the leverage target?
Jim Nickolas: Sure, we’re expecting our CapEx, again, consistent with last year is consistent with our guidance between $315 million to $400 million this year, maybe up incrementally more, if think about as percent of sales as a business grows, will have to, pro rata increase CapEx to some degree just to keep the equipment will maintain et cetera, as we grow. But the more interesting question is next year, I think once we get to our target, that the EBITDA ratio, the target leverage zone two to two and a half times, which will be out by the end of the year, they will have free cash flow and more options to deploy, their free cash flow and I think we need to pull back on our – you’ve heard before our strategic plan for that cash flows is first and foremost of investing in the business and also then the value adding acquisitions. So that is something we think we’ve done well, historically. We think we’ve got more opportunity there. There’s more room to consolidate. And we’ll take advantage of that, at that point. Still we have beyond, of course, we will return to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases and higher dividends.
Ward Nye: Stanley, Jim has a high class problem. And that is he gets to go out and do the largest – second largest transaction our company’s history last April. And by the time he gets to the end of third quarter this year, he’s back within his target ratio. So again, making sure that we use that money really wisely is going to be a key priority for us.
Stanley Elliott: Yeah, you know, it’s certainly great setup. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it and best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning. Great quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, I’m curious, I want to ask about residential first, the permit activity has slowed at least on national basis. What do you see on the ground in your market?
Ward Nye: I guess what I would say is this, if you look at our top 10 states, several things worth noting. We’re clearly outperforming the nation. So if we look at our top 10, as you said, national prominence relatively flat, our top 10 are up four. If we look at single family, they’re up to, if you look at multifamily, we’re up nine versus the nation up one. So I think that just underscores why where you are in this business matters so desperately. We’re seeing affordability best in places like the Midwest, the Southeast, and Southwest. And we think if you look at those regions of the country, that’s simply where we have a very notable geographic advantage. And if you look at where the population trends are going, we like where we’re sitting there as well. So as we look at housing, and again, it was something I tried to speak to and my prepared remarks, we see that in Martin Marietta geographies continuing to be very attracted. The piece of it that surprised me, Adam, has been the resilience of multifamily and I think in many respects, multifamily has continued to be resilient, because homeowners, home builders are shifting to more affordable homes right now. But at the same time, there’s some real estate that has to be acquired for them to do that. So I think we’re going to end up with something on multifamily that continues to look attractive. And I think we’ve got the next leg of single family on affordable res that’s still ahead of us.
Adam Thalhimer: That’s helpful. Thanks. And then I wanted to ask about thoughts and M&A in general, kind of piggy backing on Stanley’s question, I guess, because you ended his question saying, you have a lot of cash. That’s important to figure out how to deploy that deployed here. As it relates to any large deals, I mean, do you guys thinking in the pay down debt before you pull off a large deal?
Ward Nye: We’re going to try to keep the appropriate balance. And we’re going to be moved, but what is – what is the deal? I mean, at the end of the day, what I think people expect us to do, is to do the right transactions for the long term Martin Marietta shareholder. And I think that was TXI. I think that was swapping the river for the Rockies. I think that was doing Bluegrass. And if you look at your question, specifically around large transactions, if you look at the large transactions that we’ve done as a company, and what we’ve been able to do relative to integrating those and standardizing those transactions, I think we’ve got an incredibly capable team of people here who assess those transactions, and then also an incredible cable team who integrate those transactions. So to the extent that the large deals become available, if they do, and they’re in markets that we find moving, if they can be done in a fashion that builds value, we’re going to be there. But equally, I would suggest to you that we have been very disciplined. And when the transaction doesn’t work, we will quit simply walk away from it.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, thanks, Ward.
Ward Nye: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Hey, Ward, over the past 25 years, you folks have been able to compound pricing closer to 5%, in aggregates and this year, obviously an uptick from last year, but still at 4%, that’s below the pricing increases that you’ve been able to achieve historically. So can you just talk about, is there a path to get to the historical 5% type increases from here? Can you step us through how you’re thinking about it?
Ward Nye: No, Jerry, I think they’re clearly, yes, I think several things play into that. One, what happens with the volume profile? So to your point, you’re looking over 25 year period that we’ve been a public company for example and what we need to step back and say as we’ve been through really a decade period of time, where volume has been incredibly challenged, but pricing has done very, very well. So here we are, for the first time in a long time, having a conversation about volumes up double-digits, right. And if you think back to the metric that you and I have spoken up before, Jerry, we’ve said, as a practical matter, you can look at aggregate volume growth, and pricing growth, and link those two things together to a degree. And our view has long then that pricing was going to lag volume modestly in a volume recovery mode. So if you go back over that same time frame that you’re speaking of, and you take that metric that I just described, I think you would find that we’re brought we’ve been broadly very correct on that. And I think if we’re hitting a point in time, where you really, you’re starting to see infrastructure, get some legs, and you can see a greater series of volume build over a period of time. Candidly, in a world where barriers to entry, continue to be high and are getting higher for significant parts of the business. I think all those are the building blocks that leads you to the question that you’re asking and why we feel confident on that.
Jerry Revich: Okay, and just to make sure, picking up the pieces that you’re laying out, it sounds like you expect to have some pretty positive pricing discussions when you roll out initial 2020 pricing to your customers based on the framework that you just laid out considering how good volumes have been this year. Is that reasonable?
Ward Nye: I don’t want to get too far ahead of my customers, but I think it’s fair to say when customers feel like they’ve got good backlogs, and they’ve got a good outlook is an easier pricing conversation with customers, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And lastly, private non-res, obviously that can be a chunky business in your portfolio depending on project cadence. Can you just talk about how concentrated is the growth that you’re seeing in your guidance this year? In other words, is there any risk from larger projects if they’re completed over the next 12 months, and there’s nothing to replace them? But how – how broad based is that private non-res demand that you’re seeing this year?
Ward Nye: No, that’s a great question, Jerry. Look back to some of the commentary I offered before. As I look at non-res in particular is Southwest up? Yes. Up notably in a percentage? Yes. Is mid-Atlantic, same thing? Yes. Midwest, same thing. Mideast, same thing, every one of those divisions that I just called out for you, from a percentage change perspective on non-res are up double-digits. And many of these projects tend to be longer term projects. The one thing I did mention before is we’re going to sell about a million tons this year into some of the large Gulf energy projects. And again, those have been slow and coming. They tend to be multi-year. And part of what I like about that Jerry is in that’s – this year, we see probably five more projects that will be out for bid or award late this year, early next year, that’s probably 3 million tons on those. Again, these are just broad projects. I’m not saying we’re going to get these. And then there’s tiling on another five or six that we think is a little bit farther out than that. That’s about 11.5 million tons on those. So again, those are those large impact energy projects, separate and distinct from the share plays, the warehouse and the distribution, the wind farms and the datacenters. So again, we seek what we think is very attractive, widespread to your question, very specifically growth in non-res.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: You’re welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman: Great, thank you. Brent Thielman. Ward, great quarter. You talked a bit about this impact of base stone clean stone mix on ASP. I’m curious, how those dynamics shape your guidance expectations for pricing for the second half of the year? I mean, are you factoring in a little more of an unfavorable mix there?
Ward Nye: Yeah, we’re probably factoring in a modest, more favorable product mix on that infrastructure piece of that probably modestly more favorable geographic mix in some respects. So that they may wash themselves out to a degree. I think one thing that’s always incumbent on us, at the end of the quarter is to walk you through it and give you but the puts and takes are on it. But again, my view on base work, just to be really clear, Brent, has always been a very positive view on base. Because what I know is, if we had the privilege of putting base down on a job, the day and the hour is going to come that we will likely put clean stone on top of that base. So it tends to be longer term, more mature type work and that’s what we do best.
Brent Thielman: And Ward, is there President for when you start to see those clean stone deliveries, or is it pretty wide ranging?
Ward Nye: It’s pretty wide ranging, but I would tend to put six to nine months after base that you start to see notable clean stone going on top of it.
Brent Thielman: Okay. And then I just want to follow-up on Colorado. It’s been a great story for Martin Marietta for a long time, notwithstanding a long winter there. Any thoughts on the overall market, I know the housing private side has been really strong for you for quite some time. Is this transition the infrastructure, I guess big enough to continue to support the growth outlook there?
Ward Nye: Well, I think you’ve got several things. One, I think you do have a good infrastructure play and good private place there. I think the other thing that’s worth noting is you do have to play some plays, particularly in the northern part of that state. And part of what we tried to do is we try to be very visionary going in as depletion place occur and building rail yards. And highway 34 rail yard, which is just coming on really this year in Weld County, which is north of Denver, but south of Cheyenne is an important part of the growth story in that state. And we think we are extraordinarily well positioned in Northern Colorado, and in Denver, and now in Southern Colorado. So remember, when we initially went into that marketplace with our asset swap, it was really a Denver North business. And now after some ball ponds that we did, several years after the initial river for the Rockies transaction, it puts us up and down that I-25 corridor in Colorado in a way that really others don’t possess right now. And that’s 80 plus percent of the population in the state, and in a state that has very nice population demographics, and very high environmental barriers to entry. So we think all that tallies up to what we feel like can continue to be a nice growth story for that business.
Brent Thielman: Okay, great. Thank you, best of luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Brent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.
Ryan Coyne: Good morning. This is Ryan calling on from Mike. You spoke to where you’re seeing the most success in residential North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. But weather aside, which geographic pockets are giving you the most challenges in terms of underlying demand trends?
Ward Nye: Relative to residential for the ex-weather? I guess what I would say is, if we’re looking in Florida looks good. Texas looks good. Maryland looks good. South Carolina looks good. And North Carolina multifamily looks good. I would guess that if we’re looking for, where’s it tougher, I guess maybe parts of the Midwest probably are not seeing the same degree of housing starts that you might see in more of the Southeast and Southwest. But again, that’s not a big surprise to us, because you really see stronger population demographics moving south and toward the coastal areas.
Ryan Coyne: Great. And then cost on labor, just as cost earlier, but I’m just quickly on asphalt. Can you speak to where you staying in terms of liquid asphalt cost and what your – in the second half?
Ward Nye: Sure. Look liquid asphalt costs are up there up about 15%, so if we’re looking at Q2 cost per ton, it was about $443. That was up just to be clear, about $67 over prior year. We’re taking full year price average might be up about 450 per ton, that’s about a 12% year-over-year part. Again, what we’re seeing in and hot mix is actually pretty good pricing on what we’re doing as well. And then here’s what I like about our hot mix business. And keep in mind, it’s uniquely a Colorado business. Our current backlog on hot mix customers is considerably over where it was last year. We’re looking at about a 40% increase over where it was last year. And as we spoke earlier, infrastructure backlog is up significantly as Colorado duty and the municipalities in that states have increased their funding. But equally important residential backlog has increased year-over-year, as homebuilders remain bullish and the market demand is increased there. So again a very nice public and private story for us relative to hot mix in the Colorado market.
Ryan Coyne: Thank you.
Ward Nye: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you and we have a question from Adrian Huerta with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Adrian Huerta: Thank you, Ward and Jim for taking my question and congrats on the results. One on the labor market again. Even the tight conditions, what are the challenges that contractors are facing to grow labor further and probably more specifically in states like Colorado and Texas? And my second question is regarding potential M&A. Given your large exposure to aggregate overall 70% of gross profits. How do you see and the outlook for aggregate cement and other downstream products? What is your target? Or what would you like to have in terms of mix in the long term so that you can work on acquisitions to get to that target? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Adrian, thanks for your question. I guess what I would say is relative to labor, if you look and see where the lowest unemployment numbers are, those will be the areas that contractors are struggling most. So is that at times a struggle for them and portions of the Southwest? Sure. Is it a time of struggle in Colorado? I have no doubt that it is. And at times even a struggle in Southeast. At the same time, I think what we’re seeing is contractors are paying more now because I think they see more demand. And so I think that the market has responded in many respects in a way that you would have expected the market to. With respect to growing our business, we’re an aggregate slow business. You’ve heard us say it for a long time, it is aggregates lead strategic cement targeted downstream, but we began with aggregates and began with that for a reason. And we do aggregates, we think very, very well. And those are the businesses that we are most moved by and those are the businesses that we will be disproportionally focused on and it's the ones that have taken us through 25 years and put us in a position that we believe that we've been able to build shareholder value very consistently. And it's a play book that we are going to stick to because we know it and we think we are good at it.
Adrian Huerta: Very clear. Thank you, Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With our step as commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and world-class attributes of our business, Martin Marietta is well positioned to deliver continued growth and enhance shareholder value. We believe 2019 will be another record year for Martin Marietta and we look forward to discussing our third quarter 2019 results in few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thanks you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta’s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Howard, and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta’s first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today’s discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q1 2019 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the first quarter 2019. Any comparisons are versus the prior year first quarter unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q1 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today’s earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our first quarter operating performance as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today’s teleconference. Martin Marietta had a first quarter performance provides a promising start to what we expect to be another record year for our company. Consolidated total revenues increased 17% to $939 million, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA increased 28% to $159 million both new first quarter records. We also achieved strong gains and other key financial metrics including a 140 basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin and earnings per diluted share of $0.68. Notably, shipment volume and pricing improved across the majority of our building materials business including robust double-digit growth in aggregate shipments is more favorable weather allowed for an earlier onset to the construction season and our customers were able to begin addressing both prior year’s weather deferred projects and current backlogs. Consistent with our expectations, public and private sector construction growth in our leading markets is outpacing the nation as a whole and supports our view of continued pricing momentum. These trends bode well for increased construction activity and position Martin Marietta for improved shipments, pricing and profitability for the remainder of 2019. We have consistently maintained that attractive market fundamentals including continued employment gains, population growth and superior state fiscal health will promote sustainable and long-term construction growth across our geographic footprint. Our first quarter results clearly demonstrated that robust underlying demand, demand that failed to translate into higher shipment volumes in 2018 due to contract or capacity constraints, logistics disruptions, and most significantly poor weather. For example, our heritage mid-Atlantic division, which includes the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland benefited from strong pent-up demand and more favorable weather conditions. These dynamics just to name a few resulted in heritage aggregate shipments that eclipsed the division’s 2007 peak first quarter volumes. While winter weather traditionally limits the ability of outdoor contractors to perform work modestly improved weather in the first quarter of 2019 provided contractors the opportunity to advance both new and delayed projects. The notable exception was in Colorado, the company’s second largest state by revenues. Colorado experienced one of its harshest winters on record in terms of precipitation and temperatures, limiting construction activity and negatively affecting the aggregates, ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving businesses of our Rocky Mountain division. Heritage aggregates shipments increased 12.5%, led by double-digit volume gains in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups. Importantly, all divisions with the exception of Rocky Mountain contributed to this robust shipment growth demonstrating the strength of Martin Marietta’s markets and breadth of accelerating demand. Heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2% as modestly improved weather, particularly in the Southeast allowed customers to commence transportation-related projects earlier in the construction season. Importantly, our North Carolina, Georgia and Florida operations saw increased infrastructure activity during the quarter following the recent acceleration in public lettings and contract awards in these key states. Consistent with our expectations when we established 2019 guidance, we believe public construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets is poised for meaningful growth in 2019 and beyond driven by funding provided by the Fixing America’s Surface and Transportation Act or FAST Act and numerous state and local funding initiatives. Our top 10 states, which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. Increased state level funding through bond issuances, toll roads and tax initiatives, is expected to continue to grow at a faster rate than near-term federal funding leading to additional growth opportunities for our company. The infrastructure market represented 33% of our first quarter heritage aggregate shipments, which is below the company’s most recent 10-year annual average of 46%, but consistent with first quarter historical trends. Heritage aggregates shipments to the non-residential market increased 33% as we continue to benefit from robust distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind turbine projects in key geographies including Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Iowa. Looking ahead, our non-residential construction and outlook remains positive with third-party forecasts including the Dodge Momentum Index projecting healthy commercial construction activity, particularly in our southeastern and southwestern regions. Additionally, large energy sector projects along the Texas, Gulf Coast are expected to increase demand for heavy building materials. Throughout the balance of 2019, the company will continue to supply products our three previously awarded energy projects, five additional projects or the pending regulatory approvals or awaiting contractor and/or supplier selection and are expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and continue for several years thereafter. Martin Marietta is well positioned to provide the aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete needs for these multi-year projects. The non-residential market represented 37%, our first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Heritage aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 8% driven by weather deferred home building activity in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Despite the recent slowdown in housing unit starts at the national level. The residential outlook across Martin Marietta’s geographic footprint remains positive, driven by favorable demographics, job growth, land availability, steady interest rates, and deficient permitting. Currently housing unit permit growth for our top 10 states is outpacing the national average for all three residential categories, total multifamily and single family. In our view, the issuance of these permits represents the best indicator of future housing construction activity. The residential market accounted for 23% of first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Volume to this sector increased 9% reflecting lower balanced and agricultural lime shipments. Heritage aggregates pricing improved 4% following the implementation of annual price increases throughout the majority of our geographic footprint. We were able to achieve the solid growth despite unfavorable product mix from increased shipments of lower price base stone, which reduced first quarter heritage average selling price by $0.29 per ton or 210 basis points. Keep in mind, an increase in base stone shipments is only unfavorable from an average selling price optics viewpoint. In fact, given the base stone is typically the initial material needed for early stage construction activity and higher price clean stone shipping subsequently follow, we’re encouraged by this trend. Drilling down to geographical trends, we achieved heritage pricing growth of 3% for the Mid-America group. This was accomplished through continued price discipline offset by product mix from base shipments, price discipline about to 6% heritage pricing growth for the Southeast Group. product and geographic mix, particularly from weather impacted Colorado shipments, limited West Group price and growth to 3%. acquired operations shipped 3.5 million tons. It’s selling prices approximately 15% below the corporate average. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter results for the legacy Bluegrass operations will be classified as heritage for reporting purposes. Cement shipments improved 7% driven by the strength of the Texas market, increased shipments of oil well products, and the addition of our new Caney sales yard in Houston. first quarter cement pricing benefited from favorable product and geographic mix, increasing 4%. Annual price increases went into effect on April 1st with widespread support in both north and South Texas. We believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from a tight supply environment in Texas as forecasted demand is expected to exceed domestic production capacity by 10% in 2019. Turning to our downstream businesses, ready mix concrete shipments decreased 4% as Colorado’s harsh winter hindered early construction activity in that state. First quarter pricing improved modestly for the ready mix business in total led by a 3% increase in Colorado. As a reminder, the majority of annual price increases became effective on April 1st in both Colorado and Texas. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from extreme winter weather including freezing ground temperatures resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. First quarter asphalt pricing in Colorado improved 4%. Importantly, bidding activity and customer confidence remained strong and we are highly confident in the strength of the Colorado market. I’ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss specifics of our first quarter financial results. Jim?
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. The building materials business achieved record first quarter products and services revenues of $809 million, an 18% increase. And gross profit improved 39% to $118 million. Aggregates product gross margin expanded to 550 basis points to 18% steadier and higher shipment and production levels provided improved operating leverage, which, in conjunction with higher prices, drove the majority of the margin improvement. as Ward highlighted, our cement operations benefited from strong volume and pricing growth. However, despite this top-line improvement, extended maintenance outages, higher rail freight costs and reduced operating leverage from lower production levels led to 1,270 basis point degradation in product gross margin. outages included planned and unplanned repairs at both cement plants and the acceleration of maintenance activities originally planned for later in the year. With over half of our 2019 planned maintenance completed, we are returning to normal production capacity at all kilns and are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand and the robust bidding pipeline throughout the remainder of the year. In late 2018, we initiated a restructuring of our southwest ready mix concrete business and are pleased with the initial results. These efforts contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in that business’s quarterly product gross margin despite relatively flat shipments and pricing. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from strong domestic steel production and increased global domain for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $69 million, a new quarterly record. Additionally, the business achieved record first quarter product gross profit of $27 million. Product gross margins held steady at an attractive 38.5%. thanks to price improvements and production efficiencies that helped offset increased sales lower margin products in higher costs for supplies and contract services. Our consolidated results included the benefit of two non-recurring items. First, we reversed a $4 million purchase accounting accrual related to the TXI acquisition, which is recorded in other operating income net as an increased earnings from operations. Second, we recorded a discreet income tax benefit of $13 million, may change in the tax status of the subsidiary from a pass-through entity to seek operation, which reduced tax expense for the quarter. Neither of these items should be extrapolated in a run rate calculation. Excluding the first quarter tax benefit and other discrete events. We expect our estimated tax rate for full year 2019 to range from 20% to 22%. And we’ll go to the rest of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with the continued focus on creating shareholder value through value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic deployment of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases, all while returning to our target leverage ratio. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million for the full year as we invest in high return projects focused on increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders through conurbation of share repurchases as well as meaningful and sustainable dividends that were increased 9% in last August. The trailing 12 months ended March 2019, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in our applicable credit agreement with 2.7 times. While this remains modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio, we expect to continue deleveraging and return to our target leverage ratio of two to 2.5 times by year end. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to ward.
Ward Nye:
(17:24) wetter: As we’ve often noted, the first quarter results are typically disproportionately driven by construction activity during the last two weeks of March. We will consider whether it’s appropriate to revisit our outlook later in the year. We believe attractive population and employment trends combined with positive momentum from state departments of transportation and continued private sector gains will support sustainable construction growth in our key regions for the rest of the year and for future periods as well. In 2019, we anticipate the growth in our top 10 states to outpace the nation as a whole and contribute to positive volume and pricing trends across all of our product lines underpinning our confidence that our company is on its way to posting another record year. As Martin Marietta celebrates 25 years as a public company this year, we’ll continue with the approach that it’s proven to be successful. Our focus on price, discipline, strategic geographic positioning and prudent capital allocation and underscored by our commitment to safety. That’s why we remain confident about Martin Marietta’s ability to achieve continued profitability growth and create value for our shareholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Catherine Thompson from Thomson Research Group. Your line is open.
Catherine Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first question is on ASPs. A two-part question, first, could you confirm that there was not as great as an inventory build in Q1 2019 versus last year, because that certainly does seem to be the feedback from the field from the industry in general. And then the second follow-up with that, could you give more quantification of that commentary that you haven’t prepared comments about a greater mix of base stone, how – to what degree, did that impact? Q1, percentage of basis points, what does it mean for visibility going forward for volumes and what does it mean for mix going forward?
Ward Nye : Good morning, Catherine. This is ward. Thanks for your question. A couple of things, one, yes, we did have actually inventory draw down in the first quarter of this year. So, we did not have to build that you saw last year. So that’s the first part of your question. I think the other part of your questions are really good one, and that’s what I’m happy to try to address, because I think this is an important notion for us to really hit very clearly. If we’re looking at the first quarter of 2018 relative to products that went out, here’s the way I would encourage you to think about it. About 25% of our product last year was base stone, somewhere between 28% and 29% of it this year was base stone. Last year, almost 52.5% of it was clean stone this year is 50%. here’s my point, Catherine. If you’re seeing more base stone glad today, that’s newer projects that are beginning from the ground up and are likely to last a longer period of time. At some point, you’re going to put asphalt or concrete on top of base stone. So, we’re going to get those clean stone sales as they come through. Greater base stone sales in my view is longer-term nice projects that pretend well for the balance of 2019 and really, I think start to tell a good story for 2020, but here’s what’s important to it as we go through that. if we take a look at what our ASP on our heritage business would have been this quarter, if we had had the same mix that we had last quarter, our ASP for heritage would have improved 6.1%. So that’s the 210 basis point improvement and we think seeing more base stone is attractive. We think that type of pricing growth, our heritage business is also attractive. And I do think I responded to your question relative to the inventories as well.
Catherine Thompson: Yes. A follow-up on the cement. Just a clarification, could you quantify how perhaps a dollar impacts this quarter versus a typical Q1 or perhaps last year in terms of how higher maintenance cost was? And then you said there were some planned and the unplanned, maybe just a little bit more clarification on planned versus unplanned maintenance.
Ward Nye: Well, let’s do it this way. I’ll ask Jim to help double team on this. Let me start the conversation in this regard. As we came into the year, Catherine, what I would say as we anticipated having about $19.2 million worth of expense relative to the kilns during the course of the year. What we’ve done in the first quarter is we spent or invested a $11.2 million of that. So, if you look at what that looks like over a period of years, that’s clearly accelerating a lot of that into the first quarter and our thought process is several for, but primarily driven by the notion that we want to be in an attractive place to run the business very aggressively as we go into the pure summer months in that Texas market. I’ll ask Jim to speak very specifically to some of the dollars around the maintenance inventory and some other issues that do affect the financials.
Jim Nickolas: Good Morning, Catherine. The breakout between the maintenance expense was about $10 million more this quarter versus Q1 of 2018. That $10 million higher expense, $6 million of that was planned about a little under $4 million that was unplanned.
Catherine Thompson: Okay, perfect.
Jim Nickolas: So that’s about 10 percentage points on the gross margin side. The other items that impact the cement, let me just run out the whole cement gross margin for clarity. We did have, because we sold, we had good sales growth, the shipments, the production was lower, given the downtime. We had to dip into our inventory in a deeper way, which resulted in a $6 million headwind for the quarter again, versus prior year. Those are the two biggest impacts, maintenance and inventory draw down. The third item was increased rate was about $2 million as we had to supply two new distribution outlets. So, there’s about $2 million of extra expense. Those are the three biggest items that impacted the gross margin for the cement business.
Ward Nye: And Catherine, what I would add onto that is obviously, the increased transportation is moving primarily into new Caney and Houston and moving out west to Odessa. So, those are some additional charges that we actually view is very welcome.
Catherine Thompson: Okay. And final just quick cleanup question on guidance and changed, I appreciate that Q1 seasonally is a smaller contributor. We know that on average for the industry from the checks we’ve done maybe, 20% of your volumes, but could you remind us, perhaps on a historical basis how much of earnings typically hit in Q1? And I guess the one thing that I’m noticing; I just wanted to make sure that we’re right on the seat. It looks like, at the first time, a big difference this year versus last year, having all three end market res, non-res and public growing. Could you just for our sake, just ensure that there’s no change on conviction even though the numbers haven’t changed, but is there any change in the conviction for the year? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Catherine, thank you again. Look, we feel very good about the year and we feel very good about the start. As we said in the prepared remarks and we don’t feel like it’s the right moment to come back and revisit guidance at all yet. And to your point, if we look at a five-year average, here’s what I would tell you, five-year average, which showed 19% of shipments occur in the first quarter, 19% of revenues in the first quarter, to your point, very specifically Catherine, 12% of gross profit and around 12% of EBITDA. So again, I think we’re sitting in a very attractive place. Everything that we see and everything that we hear from customers for the year looks wonderful at this moment and you’re certainly not hearing anything that tends to be a lack of conviction from us on the full year.
Catherine Thompson: Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Catherine.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms: Thank you. Good morning. So, the first question, I have is on aggregates incrementals, you guys saw an improvement and I think by my math, were about – the incrementals were about 38%, 39% and I know it’s difficult to look at incremental margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but you guys are, I believe looking for full year to be around the 60% range. So, can you talk about some of the factors impacting 1Q that maybe won’t be an issue in future quarters or how to think about the bridge and incrementals margins for aggregates, going to get into that 60% range to the year?
Ward Nye: Good morning, Trey. Thanks for your questions. A couple of things, I do think it’s important to hit just what you said and that is remember, that’s 60% on average in the aggregates business. So, I want to make sure that we’re talking about that. Obviously, Q1 is a little bit different, because you don’t have significant portions of the aggregates business that are really running the way that we expect them two-fold full year. So, that is a caveat. let me turn it over to Jim to walk you through some of the math on where it looks like for the quarter and how we think that shakes out for the year.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. good morning, Trey. Two things that I’d like to point out, one, the headline number is in fact 30% incrementals, but what that’s missing is the fact that we didn’t have Bluegrass in Q1 of 2018. if you were to do a pro forma calculation, including bluegrass, the incrementals would go to 51%. So, about a 13% improvement, just that simple math change. in addition, we increased the tons we ship predominantly the rail in this quarter by 17% and that led to higher freight cost for the quarter, which would account for another 13% incremental points to getting us to close to 64% just taking those two items into account.
Trey Grooms: Gotcha. Okay. And that’s still the case; just kind of looking on a full-year basis is for the overall business to get back to that kind of 60% range, that’s the outlook for…
Jim Nickolas: That’s right. That’s what we’re still expecting.
Ward Nye: The overall aggregate business is correct, right.
Trey Grooms: yes, yes, for aggregates. Thank you. And then secondly on the infrastructure side, up 2% I think, which it kind of lags some of the other end markets. And I think you’re looking for infrastructure now to be up kind of high single digits. Can you talk about what you’re seeing there on that end market and how we should see that progress as we go through the year with that kind of coming out of the gate a little slower?
Ward Nye: Yes. I guess what I would say Trey, in many respects, if you think about the way DOT specifications work, there is not going to be a lot of asphalt paving in particular in most jurisdictions until after you get about March 15. So again, if we’re looking at the rhythm and cadence of the way that the years building, we’re not at all surprised by for infrastructure sets here at the end of the first quarter. I think if we go back to that commentary I gave you early on about seeing more base stone, I think that’s the type of work you’re going to see being driven toward infrastructure this year. And one I would say too is simply looking at the states that matter most to us, I mean Texas is looking at $8.2 billion worth of letting the share. that’s a very big job, very big number and we’re seeing a number of very attractive design build jobs in that state. If we look at Colorado that did not have a particularly great year, last year. 2019 looks a lot better. They’re looking at $2.2 billion DOT budget versus $1.6 billion last year and the state even more recently has transferred $650 million of FY2018 general fund surplus to transportation over the next couple of years. If you look at NCDOT here in our backyard, full year 2019 letting estimate $2.8 billion to $3 billion, and again, these are very – that was the big numbers. That’s a 35% increase over what we saw last year. And if we’re looking at Georgia, they’re looking at lettings of about $1.9 billion, that’s 2x of what we were seeing back in 2014. And if we’re looking at what they’re looking for in 2020, they’ve requested $2.1 billion in 2020, so that’s a 10% increase. So I think back to your point, I think seasonality is what has affected infrastructure as we’ve come out of the gate. We fully expected it though the letting activity that we’re seeing from the states is very good. And the backlogs that we’re hearing from our contractor clients are often at record levels. So, again, I think we’ve got enormous conviction and confidence around where infrastructure is going this year.
Trey Grooms: Right. That’s encouraging. And then if you look at, I guess last one from me was you’ve made a comment word about April 1st pricing in cement. Can you remind us how much you guys went out with, and I think you mentioned lots of res support in North and Central Texas, just any other granularity around that. And I know you don’t do a lot in Houston market, but just any other color on what you might be seeing in the Houston market particularly?
Ward Nye: Now, happy to try to help with that. I mean, number one, same pricing up in Q1 is just nice to see period, because to your point, the price increases for us in that marketplace really don’t go on back to April 1, and by the way, same answer on ready mix concrete. So we’re talking about right now, North Texas is somewhere in that $6 to $8 per ton and South Texas $4 to $5 and that Houston and Central Texas popping in that $5 range, Trey. So again, it gives you a good steady snapshot of what it looks like. And again, it’s fairly consistent with what we’ve seen over the last years. Pricing tends to be a little bit better in North Texas, a little bit weaker by the time you get to the Gulf for reasons that you understand.
Trey Grooms: Got it. All right. Thanks for all the color and congrats on the nice quarter.
Ward Nye: Trey, thanks so much. Have a great day.
Trey Grooms: Thank you. You too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Schrier from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Scott Schrier: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, non-res was a pleasant surprise in the quarter, you had a significant year-on-year growth and understanding that it is a small quarter. but I’m curious if you could talk a little bit about, first, was there any impact from the Houston chemical plant incident. And second, was this non-res performance in line with your expectations or did outperform and was there some pull forward? Just want to get a sense for what the bidding process looks and the cadence of the non-res, which you know seems to be a pretty good surprise in the quarter.
Ward Nye: Yes. Several things that I’d say Scott, now the Houston situation was not particularly a driver for that. If we come back and take a look at really what we were seeing in states that matter the most to us, non-res for us in North Carolina is up nicely, non-res for us in Georgia is up very, very nicely. So, I think that’s a lot of it. If we go and look at the nature of some of the non-res, it’s got a nice enduring quality to it. You’ve heard us speak over the last several years about warehouse and you’ve heard us speak about data centers. You’ve heard us speak increasingly about wind farms, that that level of activity continues to be really quite strong in our footprint. So, I think a lot of what you’re seeing on non-res, number one, it’s not a surprise to us, and number two is, really driven by some states that population trends and employment trends have been very strong over the last several years. But volume trends haven’t been as strong. And I think part of what we’ve been waiting for, and I think much of what the investor base has been waiting for is to see states like North Carolina and Georgia really start to before. So, remember one of the things that we’ve long talked about is the importance of that bottom right hand corner of the United States map to our business. And as we look at what one of the big differentiators were – has been in non-res for the quarter that was a piece of it. The other thing that I would tell you and it’s not so much a mover for the quarter, I think it’s going to be a mover for the year as you’re looking non-res will be what’s happening with those large energy projects in the Gulf. As you recall, we’ve been talking about a dozen-ish of those large jobs that are either in action or we believe coming into action in the not-too-distant future. Today, we’ve got two different jobs with Exxon and, and one at Cheniere LNG Train 3 in that marketplace. And we think more coming during the course of the year. But back to your point, Scott, those were the primary drivers that we’re seeing in non-res.
Scott Schrier: Got it. Great. And then I wanted to ask another one on cement and cement pricing and your comments suggested that you have some confidence in any environment, but I just want to ask a little bit about that confidence and especially near Houston, where you’ve had imports as a rescue, some of the global cement trade happenings that could influence multinationals willingness and the ability to import. We see the emergence of some independent cement terminals coming online in Texas. So, I’m wondering how all that plays into the environment for pricing in Texas. Given that of course, we know there’s that supply and demand imbalance, but just want to see if that throws a wrench in the mix a little bit.
Ward Nye: Yes. I guess my comments would be two-fold. I think you finished with something that I think some important point and that is you do have supply demand imbalance there. You’ve got more demand than you have supply number one. Number two, in many respects with the exception really in one notable case, the people, who were importing are also domestic producers in that marketplace. And if you come back and reflect on it while Texas is in fact the only state in which we have cement, our cement operations strategy number one in Dallas, and number two in San Antonio. So, if we look at the large cities in Texas, our drivers are really going to be DFW, it’s going to be San Antonio and then two degrees South Texas and Houston. So, I would say the supply demand imbalance is very healthy for where we are. I think the pricing environment is more attractive. I think the fact that really, you’ve only got one non-domestic producer, who is coming in at any moment keeps things in a very steady state even in that part of the state right now. So again, if we’re looking at how we view Texas cement this year, we have a very robust view of how that business is going to perform.
Scott Schrier: Great. Thanks for that, Ward and good luck.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our question or comment comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. I wanted to follow up first on the aggregates pricing. On a mix adjusted basis, the 1Q pricing was up around 6% year-over-year. So, above the 3% to 5% that you’re expecting for the year, are we already seeing some of the pricing tailwind benefit from the strong start to the year? How would that – how do you, would you expect that to carry forward as we go into the heart of that construction season?
Ward Nye: Nishu, I would say maybe modestly, you’re seeing some of that, what I would say is really, if you think about the work that’s going early in the year, most of its going to be work that was put into back clock last year. So to the extent that things could be tighter in some markets before the end of the year is over, I don’t think you’re necessarily seeing that benefit just yet. Again, I think the mix effect does mass quite as the overall strength of the aggregates. I also think that in the fullness of time, particularly in some of the eastern markets, you’re likely to see a bit more tailwind on that. But again, if we’re coming back and saying, how do we see pricing right now, did we feel confident within the guidance that we put out? Yes, we do, and do we feel even better about the mixed that we’re seeing go out. I feel unquestionably better about that and mixed the more base from my perspective the better.
Nishu Sood: Got it. Great. And the second question, as you were discussing the improvement in performance relative to last year, one of the topics, which you brought up again in terms of 2018 was the issue of contractor labor constraints. As we think about this year so far, it’s still early in the construction season, but is your – is your 1Q and the momentum coming out of the quarter evidence that some of those contractor labor constraints have begun to ease or is it really more the weather, the early start to the construction season that you described in some parts of the country?
Ward Nye: Nishu, I think it’s probably all of the above. Clearly, the weather was better. I think backlogs for customers, who are better. But if we look at construction employment to recruit 3.4% in March of 2019 versus the prior year, and it’s well above the national rate and building on a 4.3% growth last year and 3.4% growth in 2017. So, we’re simply looking at the sheer number of people who are now coming to work or coming back to work in construction. It’s growing. So, I think number one, that’s gotten better. Number two, weather was better. I think the other issue is we’re going to have better logistics this year with both truck and rail. So, I think a number of the bottlenecks that we saw last year, are they going to be 100% gone this year? I’m not – certainly not going to bet on that. Are we seeing labor better right now for contractors and we saw a year ago, absolutely we are, which is why I’ve come back and answered your question. I don’t think it’s one thing with the other. I think it’s a confluence of factors that are actually working the way that we thought that they would.
Nishu Sood: Great. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Nishu.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Phil Ng: Hey guys, heritage pricing in aggregates and cement were very strong at the start the year and as you kind of flag a lot of the increases you guys have in place for spring, next don’t kick in until April. So, I guess based on what you realize thus far and as that kind of flow through and trickle through over the course of the year. It seems like there’s potentially some upside to the 3% to 5% of pricing that you've guided. Any color on that front would be helpful. And is there an opportunity, I guess, if things are really tight and strong, maybe certain market you guys go for a second round back half of the year?
Ward Nye: Yes. It will be interesting, Phil. Again, I think we're just, at this stage, just sticking with the 3% to 5% on price. I do think there can be some places this year, depending on how weather cooperates, otherwise it might get tight. Could I actually see some tightness in parts of Eastern North Carolina? I think that's possible. Is it possible that you could see some tightness in some portions of Colorado? I think that's possible. Yes, possible, but you might see some tightness in some parts of the Midwest, and I think that could be. So I think we'll simply have to watch that. As a general rule, we don't talk much about the notion of midyears until we get closer to midyears. We discussed last year the fact that the contractors prefer to go ahead and see whatever the price is going to be early in the year and have some sense that that's what it's going to be throughout the course of the year. I think that is typically what you're going to see, but I do think tightness can make some individual projects bid differently as we get deeper into the year.
Phil Ng: Got it. That’s helpful. And Ward, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how transportation activity in some of your key states like North Carolina, Georgia and Florida were starting like to pick up both from the letting standpoint. Just from a timing perspective, I just want to get a better appreciation, do you start seeing some of that flow through this year? Or is it kind of more of a 2020 event? And based on the backlogs you had coming into the year and how it's shaping up for 2020, do you stack things up from a growth standpoint? Do you think things accelerate even more in 2020 or kind of pretty steady 2019 versus 2020?
Ward Nye: I think you’re going to see a good pickup in 2019. And part of what I'm taken by right now, Phil, and I haven't heard this as much in years past as I've heard this year, I've heard several contractors telling me early in this quarter – by this quarter, I mean Q1 in this instance – that they were already building work into 2020. So I think in many respects, the infrastructure that is there, that has been bid, that we know is coming, is, in many respects, baked for 2019. I think what you're looking at is, particularly on the public side, a level of bidding and letting activity that I think, at this point, starts building into a very steady 2020 as well. I think your commentary on that is entirely correct.
Phil Ng: Okay. Thanks a lot. good luck in the quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good morning everyone.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: What I’m wondering if you can just expand on your pricing comments. So like-for-like, pricing is up 6% this quarter, and I'm just trying to square that up with the comments that – on the full year guide and the discussion you just had a moment ago. I guess it sounds like from a – just a spot market basis alone, there should be upwards pressure to the guidance. So I'm just wondering, is it – just back to your volume comment earlier on the call, is it too early in the year to revisit the pricing outlook? Or are we expecting the mix headwind to go from 200 to 300 basis points? I guess I'm trying to square that up. Is it just a function of it's early to the year, and let's just see how next quarter develops versus now the pricing is set, we have large work coming that's preset prices? Can you just help me square that up?
Ward Nye: No, I can’t. And Jerry, I think you nailed it there in the middle. It's just too early in the year right now. We don't say anything that makes us lose our conviction on pricing. Pricing this year from our vantage point looks more attractive than pricing did last year. I don't see anything that's going to materially change that. I think your point is entirely on target, and that is it's the first three months of the year. And important markets like Colorado didn't even wake up because it's how I like to tell people they had a wonderful ski season and a really bad construction season this year. So we're going to wait and see what this looks like, where the entire business across our enterprise is really going. And the odd thing is, Jerry, that truly doesn't happen usually until the 1st of May because if you think about it, some of the Midwest is still simply coming out of a flooding circumstance as well. So, it's certainly not due to any lack of conviction, we're just not going to get in over our skis after just three months into the year.
Jerry Revich: Okay, understood. And then in terms of the results from a non-res standpoint, really strong in the quarter. Is that just an easy weather comp in a certain area? Or did you win one of the major infrastructure projects in terms of LNG and chemicals? Or how much was that in the mix? And your comment earlier, just a clarification on the infrastructure piece. So when exactly do you expect, based on shipment timing, to see an acceleration from the low single-digit range that we saw in the first quarter towards the – a high single-digit run rate that you expect the balance of the year?
Ward Nye: Yes. With respect to your first question with respect to non-res, it was really more driven by just broad, solid non-res activity across the enterprise. But as I indicated earlier on, you did see a couple of states that are seeing particularly strong non-res gains. And again, that's North Carolina and Georgia. So when we're seeing that, that does help us pretty considerably. To the second part of your question, no, there was not any particular big project in the Gulf or otherwise that served to skew that or make it more look attractive. I just think we're sitting in a place that non-res for us is likely to be pretty attractive this year, and it came out of the box in a good, strong way. And I do think there has been some pent-up demand there, but I think there are also good backlogs that continue to be – being built by our contractor base right now, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. A quick question on CapEx expectations. You've been spending above depreciation probably like four, five years now. How long should we think that, that continues? What do we think about kind of moderating that back? First part. And then second part, maybe speak to some of the cost savings programs that you all have underway, I think, which is probably due to some of the CapEx that you've been running at a higher level.
Ward Nye: Stanley, good morning. Thanks for your question. A couple of things. You’re entirely right. If we look over the last several years, we have been spending CapEx at above DD&A levels. And oftentimes, we'll refer you to DD&A levels, because that's not a bad number for you to keep in mind on what a stay-in-business CapEx number would look like. What I think you'll see is if you look at the range that we set for CapEx this year, it's actually getting closer to our DD&A levels. So you've actually seen that very naturally and gradually. And I would submit to you down simply because we spend some money in some very careful ways, and the organization in many respects is as well capitalized today as it's ever been. What I'll do is turn it over to Jim to talk to you a little bit more about some of the specifics in the CapEx program, but I wanted to make sure, to your point, that we're level-set relative to history, the fact that we're below DD&A during the downturn, about now getting closer to DD&A.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. As Ward mentioned, our DD&A is converged with our CapEx spending by and large five years ago. that wasn't the case we’re coming out of the recession, have to make up some loss ground. We've done that by and large, and if you look over time, our CapEx as a percent of revenues has ranged from 8% to 10% and we've been trending lower. So, last couple years, closer to 8% and we expect it to stay right around that spot. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of the specific projects, we've got – we've got some large mines that were moving underground has been ongoing. Those should be wrapping up in the next year or two. But we also want to keep some powder dry for opportunistic commercial activities that we have a chance to partner with a contractor in unique ways, we want to keep some dry powder for that. And we've been deploying and we'll be deploying some money on special projects that a) provide outsized returns, and b) help us ensure ongoing business with that contractor.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Jim in your comments, you had mentioned M&A, I mean does that still seem to be kind of kind of a high pick item for the company right now or with that just kind of messaging more that you’re consistent with kind of the capital redeployment strategy that you've had in the past?
Jim Nickolas: Stanley, I think if you go back and look at the capital allocation priorities, the right transaction continues to be at the top of the list for us. So, for example, when we look at the way bluegrass is performing for us, hitting the EBITDA margins that we thought we would see we're seeing synergies nicely in advance of the $15 million that we had indicated at marketplace that we'd be getting. That's my long way of saying. the right transaction continues to be the number one capital priority for us, investing in the business is pretty close behind that and making sure that we have it well done and then returning cash to shareholders, there were meaningful and a sustainable dividend and the share buyback. So, those have been staples to our dialogue over the last several years and they continue to be in that order.
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong start for the year.
Jim Nickolas: Thanks so much Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: [Indiscernible]
Ward Nye: Garik, I heard something, but I didn't hear your full question.
Garik Shmois: Sorry. Can you hear me now?
Ward Nye: Yes, I can. Thanks. Good to hear your voice.
Garik Shmois: Yes. So, I want to ask you some volumes in non-res in particular, how much of the volume do you think might have been pulled forward into the quarter? And just given the favorable weather and do you characterize any risk that I have a vacuum in demand in the second half of the year just given the earlier start to the season?
Ward Nye: I'm going to ask my partner in crime, Jim Nickolas to respond to, then I’ll circle back to you Garik.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. I think it’s actually the reverse of being pulled forward, it’s a bit more of a carryover from Q4 that there's been a slowdown in from weather impacted delays. So, I think if there's any weather movement, it’s benefitting from the Q4 we had, I don't think it's as much a pull for from Q2 or Q3.
Ward Nye: and Garik, I guess what I would say too is I think it's possible that you might start seeing some tonnage going to those large energy projects this year that we do not have specifically committed right now. So, I think if I'm looking at non-res across our enterprise at echo, but Jim said, but at the same time I don't see something relative to activity or inactivity there that causes me any degree of concern or pause as we’re looking at, I think non-res is going to be a very strong segment from Martin Marietta this year.
Garik Shmois: Okay. And then, my follow-up question is just on inventories. You talked about the draw down in Q1, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify that in aggregates and then as you rebuild inventories over the remainder of the year, how should that impact incremental margin? Should we perhaps [indiscernible].
Ward Nye: You’re breaking up there, but I think I got the gist of your question, okay. So, we did draw down inventories to some degree this quarter and with a mild headwind, but as we build inventory in the remainder of the year, that should act as a tailwind for us. So that should be helpful.
Garik Shmois: Okay. thank you. Okay,
Ward Nye: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Timna Tanners : Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Timna.
Timna Tanners : I want to ask, I know you mentioned that your Cassie's party was debt pay down, but you did buy back shares in the second half of last year. And I just – when I, if you can remind us how you think about the timing decisions for $5.
Ward Nye: Yes. So, we're focusing remaining investment grade and deleveraging as we stayed in when we bought bluegrass. But of course, we resumed the share buyback in the last year. And we're still – we're still on that path Q1 seasonally low or light quarter for us from a cash flow perspective. So we held off, but we expect to resume in the rest of the year by deploying some of our cash per share repurchases.
Ward Nye: We try not to look at it just in a strictly rigid way either. We want to be realistic and if we can want it to be opportunistic with it. So we try to look at it in a very clear-eye fashion.
Timna Tanners : Okay. And then just wondering if you have any of your – if you could update us on your latest thoughts are, what's your sources in Washington saying about funding sources for the next highway spending program. I know it's a little bit early but was just starting to, we've been seeing more headlines about the two sides of the aisle perhaps coming together, different funding sources, whether it be gas tax increase or actually per vehicle kind of monitoring sources. So it just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on how that's going play out?
Ward Nye: Well, I guess I know what you know and that is, I believe the President and Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, I think we're supposed to meet today to discuss infrastructure. I think there's several things to watch. I think between now and clearly August is going to be an important time. Clearly you've got the U.S. Chamber and others who were very focused on a near-term gas tax increase. And I think that's the important phraseology to put to it near term, because the simple fact is the United States is going to have to in the fullness of time move away from a gas tax and come up with other mechanisms. I think those mechanisms include vehicle mileage tax on trucking. I think it can include electric battery taxes. I think it can include to a degree an indexed gas tax. I think the table was fairly open on stuff those can be and I think what's going to be fascinating is to see how interested the Republicans and the Democrats are two actually work together on this. It is the one area that we believe there is bipartisan agreement. I think if they're going to get there, they need to get there sooner rather than later because once we get into election season it gets increasingly challenged.
Timna Tanners: I know the tough question asking you about politics, so I appreciate your thoughts on it. Thanks again.
Ward Nye: You’re welcome, Timma.
Operator: Thank. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Rohit Seth: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just – what are the hot topics this quarter has been on the Mississippi River flooding and I know you guys have some exposure to Iowa, Nebraska and some of the neighboring states and your ChemRock/Rail volumes were a little bit weak. Just maybe you could speak on that and just gives a status of what’s going on over there.
Ward Nye: Yes, I guess, what I would say. You’re right, there has been some flooding as you recall, we’re not up and down really that Mississippi River market anymore, but we do have some flooding that has hit sit our businesses in the Midwest. Now when I say that, we haven’t suffered in our quarries with flooding, but local communities have certainly suffered from it. And point, I’ll tell you too is there is tonnage that’s required to come behind these storms. If we’re looking that our current backlog or customer backlog in the Midwest specifically, it’s 59% over where it was in the prior year. And that’s a pretty big number. And a good bit of that has been some shot rock that has been required already to be used to help remedy some of the flooding and shot rock that we think will continue to be required over the next several months to do that as well. So at least last year when Hurricane Florence came through, we had flooded sits in the Midwest. We do not flooded bits, I’m going to be really clear on that point. But I do think from a business perspective it would generate some activity. It certainly creates individual pain and loss for families and our hearts and prayers and money and resource going out to them in many instances. But I do think that’s where we sit relative to a business snapshot on that issue, Rohit.
Rohit Seth: Gotcha. Okay. And then on variable costs on diesel and asphalt, maybe give us a sense of your outlook on those who are here?
Ward Nye: Yes, I mean, here’s what I’ll say. If we look at really where diesel was first quarter, expense was relatively flat on a 7.4% reduction in pro gallon pricing. Now the difference was we also had 7.8% increase in usage simply due to Bluegrass. So we’re just kind of have to seek where that goes for the rest of the year. We are not hedged on diesel. The primary hedge we have on that, as you recall over years has been relative to what we contend to do with respect to average selling price. But at least as we look diesel in the first quarter, relatively well behaved. As reminder, last year for the full year we used a little bit over 47 million gallons of diesel fuel and that was not having Bluegrass with us in the first quarter. Obviously liquid asphalt is up for the year. We think that actually probably works relatively well do asphalt pricing. And we’ve seen relatively flat natural gas pricing and that can matter to us, particularly relative to costs with respect to our magnesia specialties business. So again, we’re, we’re looking at an overall input cost situation that we don’t think is unattractive at all.
Rohit Seth: Gotcha. Okay. And then final question on, we talked about the base stone potentially impacting the mix, but you had really good heritage pricing in the quarter. Is the guidance inclusive of that mix headwind? So all in, good underlying pricing but potentially some mix of base stone?
Ward Nye: Yes. We do our best to look at the mix and see where we think it’s going to be. We felt like because of the increased infrastructure that there would be more based activity this year. I think we probably saw a little bit more base activity earlier than we thought we would have. So we have done our best to apply in many respects. What I hate to say is some art to that. So that’s where we are obviously by the time we get to have here, we’re going to have much better feel for it. But I think you get a sense of what the puts and takes are right now.
Rohit Seth: But then the base stone is not a margin headwind, it’s just a optics thing, right?
Ward Nye: It is absolutely, positively an optics thing. That’s entirely correct.
Rohit Seth: All right. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Rohit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Adrian Huerta: Thank you for taking my call and congrats on the results. Two questions if I may. One on M&A. If you’re starting to see valuations getting more expensive for – to acquire aggregate quarries. And my second question has to do with the Bluegrass prices, that they’re really – they – where already 15% below your prices and they seem to be at the same level. Do you see the opportunities for the coming quarters for that gap to close? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Adrian, good morning and welcome to the call and welcome to covering our company. We’re delighted to have you. And just a couple of things. M&A what I would say, it’s a completely depends. It depends on sellers’ expectations, it depends on what we think can be done with the business. Do I think sellers’ expectations have gone up as the industry has very modest recover over the last several years they have. But at the same time in the right markets are we able to find M&A transactions that can be incredibly value creating for our shareholders? The answer is yes. Does it mean that you’re going to have to be a bit more selective on some of those? I think the answer to that is, yes as well. We’ve tried to be really disciplined in what we look at, and we try to be really disciplined in our due diligence process if it makes sense, we tend to move on it. I think if you go back and look at our history on transactions that we’ve done, they’ve tended to work very well. Now, what you don’t see are the transactions that we’ve walked away from. So are they more expensive today? Yes, they probably are. Is the good value there to be found? Yes, they are. Your other questions, so perfectly fair one is with respect to Bluegrass and how that looks relative to pricing. We’ve said in our headline numbers that their ASPs tend to be 10% to 15% below our heritage business. I think that’s entirely true. I think what you’ll see probably over the fullness of time issue, we’ll see things probably move a little bit better in the nearer term in places like Georgia. Yes, I think you’ll see them then move in medium term more in places like Maryland. I think markets such as Kentucky, which simply does not have the type of robustness in many respects that you have in places like Georgia and Maryland will move upwardly and a little bit slower rhythm and cadence, but nonetheless, I think in a rhythm and cadence that will be value creating very appropriate, and by the way, from, from our perspective, not at all surprising.
Adrian Huerta: That’s great. Thank you so much. Appreciate your feedback.
Ward Nye: Thank you Adrian.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Michael Wood: Hi, good afternoon. A mountain quarry typically see some losses in asphalt, so that’s not unusual, but there was no improvement since last year and last year, I know you, you were lagging the recovery of inflation. Can you just give some color there in terms of what you’re seeing on price cost and what pricing on asphalts looking like as the construction season gets underway?
Ward Nye: Yes, I guess, I’d say a couple of things to your point. Q1 volumes were down 29%, but winter had the biggest impact on that simply due to temperature and specification. So the front range had a real winter this year. It was colder, it was wetter. And clearly we felt that. If we’re looking at pricing, Q1 asphalt pricing was actually up 4%. So we think that’s a nice harbinger of things to come for the year. If we’re looking at Q1 asphalt and paving backlogs and this is what I think is really important, Michael, there were up to 60%. So, I mean, that’s a very nice pipeline that we have on the business. If we look at the way it’s spread across the business too, that’s important because in keeping with the commentary we’ve had on the call so far, Q1 infrastructure up 46%. Q1 res up 39%, Q1 non-res up 15%, all of these versus the prior year quarter again in that Colorado business. So, if we’re looking at what the downstream businesses looking like they are, we think it really is very attractive. We talked about some of the cash flow issues the Colorado DOT had last year that we think that they’ve clearly found their way through. So we’re feeling very confident on that business right now. If we look at our overall infrastructure Q1 backlog in asphalt, it represents 50% of the total asphalt and paving backlog versus 46% last year. So it’s not just that we feel like we’ve got good work ahead of us, we’ve got good work ahead of us in areas that we anticipated that we would have good work.
Michael Wood: Great. That’s very helpful. And then, in terms of the Texas cement market, just curious, what is needed there in terms of growth for the first demand outstrip domestic supply and roughly what can you tell us on the import price differential versus domestic pricing?
Ward Nye: Yes, I guess what I would say is, would there be room to add a few hundred thousand tons here or there in Texas, they probably could at the same time, that’s a marketplace that, we’re pretty happy with whether that marketplaces is working right now. So we don’t feel the need to add much to that. I would think the input in Houston, the differential can be – let’s call it low-20s, the delta on occasion, but then you’ve got transportation logistics that they’d come into play once it gets there so it can move around pretty considerably, Michael. That’s a tough number to nail with precision.
Michael Wood: Great. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thomson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Nice quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, ward. April was a little wetter year-over-year. Did that give you any pause vis-à-vis the guidance?
Ward Nye: Yes. I’ll tell you the one thing that you’ve always seen us do is draw a really bright line between the quarter just ended and the new quarter, it’s starting, because I know if I ever say anything about it, then people will think, well, he’s talking about it because he’s good. And if I don’t say something and they’re going to extrapolate, he’s not saying anything because it’s bad. I will tell you, part of what you’ve heard us say is, we feel really good about a year right now, Adam and I would – I feel really good about the year.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, fair enough. And then, last thing, I was just hoping you could walk us around Texas. What are you seeing by the major – in the major metros for this year?
Ward Nye: Look, I happy to try to do that. I think Dallas, Fort Worth is going to continue to be a really attractive marketplace. Being part of what I like about that marketplace is it stays good on both the public and the private side. We’ve talked about what’s happening there relative to the large design build work that’s coming, but here’s what’s important about that, Adam. I mean, you’ve got $1.6 billion worth of design build work around $635 million in Dallas, but, and there’s $520 million of it going on in Austin. There’s $4.2 billion of it in Houston in $1.8 billion coming in San Antonio. Actually, what I think we’re going to see this year and we’d like this is we’re seeing a much healthier Central Texas or San Antonio that we’ve seen over the last several years looking really at those marketplaces. That’s been one of the tougher ones in Texas, and what striking to me is still, if we’re looking at employment and metrics for the state, Texas is still ranked first as of March, 2019 in employment growth versus the prior year. But think of it in these terms too, I mean Texas with all the growth that it’s had is still second in total housing permits and second in single family permits and number one in multifamily. So when, when we look at all of that, then come back and say, what could the prospect of that state look like when these energy projects really come to some degree fruition with 24 million tons of aggregates, 2.9 million cubic yards of ready mix and 1.6 million tons of cement. These are all pretty striking numbers in a state where we’ve got the largest aggregates, cement and ready mix position in between Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. So that’s a long way of saying. Yes, I’ve listened to economists four and five years ago, say Texas was going into a slow down. Our team all looked at each other at the time and said, we don’t see it, and we continue to see a very healthy Texas marketplace.
Adam Thalhimer: Great. Thanks Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam. Howard, are there any others in the queue?
Operator: I’m showing no additional audio questions in the queue at this time, sir.

Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Martin Marietta's, Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sony, and I'll be your coordinator today.  At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg : Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's, fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As detailed on slide two, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today’s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for full year 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our 2018 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our operating performance as well as market trends and expectations for 2019. Jim Nickolas will then review our 2018 financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you Suzanne and thank you all for joining today’s teleconference. Martin Marietta’s success is rooted in our commitment to our core values and the disciplined execution of our Strategic Operating Analysis and Review or SOAR process. Today’s reported results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach as we once again delivered record financial and safety performance and did so without the benefit of meaningful shipment growth across our heritage Building Materials business.  For the full year consolidated revenues increased 7% to a record $4.2 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA increased 9% to a record $1.1 billion. These outstanding results were driven largely by solid pricing gains across the Building Materials business and the Bluegrass Materials acquisition, the second largest transaction in our company's history.  We also established new records for net earnings and earnings per diluted share, excluding the onetime benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on prior year earnings. As you’ve heard us say before, every facet of our business starts with safety. We are particularly proud to have built upon 2017 record results to achieve the best Heritage Safety Performance in our company's history.  Teams at our newest operations have also worked diligently to improve their safety performance, embracing our Guardian Angel and Wing Man cultures. Companywide, we achieved world class loss time instant rate levels for the second year in a row.  Elevated safety awareness across the company is also reduced downtime from workplace incidents, leading to higher revenues and profitability. Our ability to repeatedly deliver record financial and safety performance validates the importance of SOAR and our successful execution of that plan, especially in light of last year's environment where aggregate shipments on a comparable basis remained only modestly above 2010 trough levels.  To emphasize, Martin Marietta has continued to steadily improve key financial metrics, chief among them profits, even if shipment volumes adjusted for acquisitions that approximate great recession levels. Importantly we continue to strengthen our foundation for longer term success through strategic geographic position, price discipline and prudent capital allocation. That's why we're more confident than ever about Martin Marietta's ability to drive continued profitability growth and enhance to shareholder value. In sum, we expect 2019 to be another record year for our company.  What gives us that confidence for 2019, it's all about our geography and culture. Construction growth from the combination of emerging public sector activity and continued private sector strengthen in our key geographies should outpaced the nation as a whole, driving improved shipment, pricing and profitability.  Our geographic footprint is concentrated in areas with attractive underlying market fundamentals, including notable employment gains, population growth and superior state and physical health. These fundamentals should promote steady and sustainable construction growth for the foreseeable future.  Robust underlying demand, customer optimism, and third party forecasts also bolstered this positive outlook. Moreover, throughout 2018 we experienced strong shipment volumes on days not adversely impacted by extraordinary precipitation and/or extreme temperatures as further demonstrated during the fourth quarter.  These trends combined with a favorable pricing environment are clear indicators of underlying market strength and customer demand, underscoring the near term growth trajectory of our business. Importantly too, we have the right teams, structure and organizational culture to leverage these positive trends for the great benefit of our many stakeholders.  Before we discuss in more detail where we're headed in 2019, let’s quickly review full year 2018 operating results. We and our entire industry started last year with high expectations. Martin Marietta along with our customers, pears and third party forecasters anticipated accelerated construction activity. These expectations formed the basis of our original 2018 aggregates volume guidance of a 4% to 6% increase.  Weather, contractor capacity issues, and logistics disruptions however challenge both our company and the sector throughout the year. These dynamics preclude customers from meaning addressing their mounting books of business. As a result heritage aggregate shipments, adjusted for shipments from the Forsyth County Georgia quarry we divested in April 2018, in conjunction with the Bluegrass Materials acquisition, increased only slightly over 2017.  It’s important to remember that these well chronicled headwinds are transient in nature and will ameliorate, serving to extend the construction cycle. The silver lining from these project delays is a notable increase in both customer and Martin Marietta backlogs as we head into 2019.  In 2018 heritage’s aggregate pricing improved 3% in line with our expectations. This improvement was achieved despite the negative impact of product mix, which lowered the company's full year average selling price by $0.13 per ton or 1%. Underlying market demand should continue to support ongoing pricing momentum.  Acquired operations shipped 13 million tons at selling prices 10% to 15% below the corporate average, but in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report that integration is substantially complete and synergy realization has exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition.  Full year Cement shipments increased 1% as an extended maintenance outage at our Midlothian plant that put us behind early in the year and was further compounded by record precipitation in Texas in February, September and October. Cement pricing increased 3% consistent with our expectations. Our Cement operations will continue to benefit from a tight supply environment as forecasted demand is expected to exceed domestic production capacity by 10% in 2019.  Ready mix concrete shipments increased slightly in 2018 as weather dampened construction activity. The pricing improvement of 1.5% is best described as the tale of two markets, where some of our pricing gains in Colorado were partially offset by product and geographic mix in Texas.  In Colorado project delays and permitting issues negatively impacted our asphalt and paving business throughout 2018, as more contractors bid on both or reduced number of as well as more geographically concentrated Colorado Department of Transportation Projects. This transitory situation should improve in 2019 with greater Colorado DOT funding and more dispersed public works. We remain highly confident in the strength of the Colorado market. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results. Jim. 
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. The Building Materials business achieved record products and services revenues of $3.712 billion. This is a 7% increase over 2017 and the company’s 9th consecutive year of revenue growth.  Reordered gross profit decreased slightly and included a $19 million negative impact related to selling acquired inventory after it was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. The acquired Bluegrass operations contributed $149 million of product revenues and adjusted gross margin comparable with our heritage mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations.  Overall aggregates, product gross margin was 25.8%, a 230 basis point reduction compared with the prior year. Weather disruptions and higher diesel expenses combined with lower inventory bills and the acquired inventory adjustment negatively impacted our cost and efficiency profile.  As Ward mentioned, our Texas Cement operations benefited from pricing and modest volume growth. Production efficiencies more than offset increased natural gas, freight and raw material costs leading between 100 basis points expansion of product gross margin to 32.5%.  For the third year in a row, Magnesia Specialties posted record revenues and profitability as the business benefited from strong domestic steel production and increased global demand for Magnesia Chemical Products. Notably international sales represented 35% of total chemical sales, up from 20% just four years ago. Pricing improvements and production efficiencies contributed to a 110 basis point expansion in product gross margin to 38.3%. Consistent in four, we continually evaluate our asset portfolio to insure our business is positioned to generate industry leading operational and financial performance. Accordingly, in December we recorded a $12 million noncash charge in other operating expenses for the West Group. The charge was related to asset and portfolio rationalizations within our Southwest ready mix concrete business.  Martin Marietta continues to create shareholder value through value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic investment and the opportunistic deployment of free cash flow through growing dividends and share repurchases, all while returning to our target leverage ratio.  In 2018 we deployed $376 million of capital into our business and returned nearly $270 million to our shareholders through both an increased dividend and the repurchase of 522,000 shares of our common stock.  Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases.  For the 12 months ended December 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidate EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.76 times, which is modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio.  Weather headwinds contributed to lower than anticipated fourth quarter EBITDA and as a result our leverage ratio was slightly higher than expected, despite reducing debt by $90 million during the quarter. For 2019, both higher EBITDA and additional debt repayments will drive leverage lower, placing the company within its targeted to 2.5 times leverage ratio by year end.  With that, I will turn the call back over Ward to discuss or 2019 outlook. 
Ward Nye : Jim thanks. This year the Martin Marietta celebrates 25 years as a public company, building on our strengths, we're well positioned to deliver another record year. As outlined in our 2019 guidance included in today's release, increased infrastructure activity and continued private sector gains in addition to a full year contribution from the form Bluegrass operations, are expected to produce positive volume trends across all of our product lines and contribute to an even more favorable pricing environment across our footprint.  Following more than a decade of under investment, we believe the infrastructure construction activity, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets is poised for meaningful growth in 2019 and beyond.  The infrastructure market represented only 39% of 2018 aggregate shipments, well below the company's most recent 10 year average of 46%. Funding provided by the Fixing America’s Surface and Transportation Act or FAST Act, combined with the actions taken at the state and local levels has resulted in an acceleration in public learning’s and contract awards in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.  Of note, we've not seen any meaningful delays and awarded contracts or construction spending resulting from the recent federal government shutdown. Our key states tend to be less dependent on federal support for highway capital projects.  Federal funding provides less than 50% of annual state DOT outlays for Texas and North Carolina, two of our largest states by revenues. The Texas DOT expects to let $9.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, up over $2 billion from the prior fiscal year. Construction growth in Texas will further benefit from large scale design built projects in and around Dallas, Fort Worth.  The North Carolina DOT has over $4 billion letting schedule for fiscal 2019, of which over half will be let in key Eastern Martin Marietta markets. States continue to play an expanded role in infrastructure investment. Income funding at the state level through bond issuances, toll roads and tax initiatives should grow at a faster rate than federal funding, leading to increased growth opportunities for our company.  Our top 10 states, which accounted for 85% of total Building Materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. Most recently, voters approved 79% of the state and local transportation initiatives on the November ballot, providing over $30 billion of targeted transportation funding across the nation.  Rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure is good for the economy, creates jobs and has bipartisan support. With the government now reopened, we are hopeful that meaningful progress will be made to advance a federal bill with a comprehensive sustainable and sufficient funding mechanism to address our nation's unmet infrastructure needs.  Although we are not seeing any meaningful up-lift in shipments in 2019, should an infrastructure bill be enacted this year, and our 2019 outlook does not factor in any such benefit, new funding will provide better visibility from large scale projects and further extend the construction cycle over the next several years. Martin Marietta’s Private Sector activity in 2019 should benefit from full employment gains and population growth across the Sunbelts.  Non-residential construction activity which represented 33% of 2018 heritage aggregate shipments should increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years as we continue to benefit from robust distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia and Iowa.  Both the Architectural Billings Index and Dodge Momentum Index indicate healthy commercial and institutional construction activity in 2019. Continued federal regulatory approvals of large energy sector projects in Texas, particularly along the Gulf Coast should notably contribute to increased heavy building materials consumption, with construction activity on five projects to begin in earnest in 2019 and continue for several years thereafter. Martin Marietta is well positioned to supply the aggregates, cement and ready mix concrete needs for these multiyear energy projects.  Residential construction which accounted for 22% of 2018 heritage aggregate shipments should continue to grow within our geographic footprint, particularly now that mortgage rates have stabilized. Our leading Southeastern and Southwestern States offer opportunities for gains in both multi and single family housing, driven by available land on overall business friendly environment and fewer regulatory barriers.  Permits are the best indicator of future housing construction activity. Currently housing unit permit growth for our top 10 states, namely Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa Florida, South Carolina, Indiana, Maryland and Nebraska outpaces the national average for all three residential categories; total, multifamily and single family.  On a national level, housing starts improved over 2017 levels but remained well below the 50 year historical average of $1.5 million. Population growth, increased household formations and low inventories should continue to drive demand for residential construction.  In summary, for 2019 we expect aggregate shipments to increase 6% to 8% with growth in all three primary construction end use markets. Specifically infrastructure shipments are expected to increase in the high single digits. Non-residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid to high single digits and residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid-single digits.  Annual price increases have already widely garnered market support, most importantly in Texas, the Carolinas and Southeast. To that end, we expect aggregates pricing to increase in the range of 3% to 5%.  We expect cement product revenues to range from $400 million to $430 million and gross profit from $130 million to $150 million as our cement operations benefit from underlying market fundamentals, weather differed shipments, solid pricing momentum and new sales outlets. Ready mix concrete and asphalt paving revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and gross profit is expected to be $130 million to $150 million.  The Magnesia Specialties business is expected to have another great year with product revenues of $270 million to $280 million and gross profit of $100 million to $105 million. These expectations reflect continued strength in global magnesia demand and domestic steel utilization. On a consolidated basis we expect total revenues of $4.480 billion to $4.680 billion and EBITDA of $1.170 billion to $1.280 billion.  To conclude, 2018 was a momentous year for Martin Marietta with the best financial and heritage safety performance in our company's history. Martin Marietta is confident in its outlook and prospects for continued growth and value creation. We believe our leading market positions, discipline pricing strategy and successful execution of our strategic plan have positioned our company for continued success.  Attractive population and employment trends, combined with positive momentum from state DOT's should drive construction growth in our key regions that outpaces the nation as a whole and contribute to a favorable environment as we work towards another record year in 2019.  If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open. 
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first question is just on guidance. What gives you confidence on the parameters that you outlined for ‘19 guidance and what would be helpful is to better understand what is – is it baked in the guidance ranging from I hate to say it, weather, but weather to capital projects and other factors that could impact the overall guidance. Thank you. 
Ward Nye: Good morning, Kathryn. Thank you the question. I think several things underscore our confidence. Number one, is what we see simply emerging on infrastructure. If we look at what is going to happen in Texas and Colorado and North Carolina and Florida, those are big numbers this year. If we look at Texas, they are looking at lettings of $9.6 billion this year, that's considerably over last year. Prop 7 funding is $4.2 billion, prop 1 funding at $1.3 billion, tremendous numbers. If we look at North Carolina, $4.1 billion worth of lettings and $2.3 billion of that in the Eastern North Carolina which is an important state for us.  Last year Colorado really ran into a cash flow problem that they do not anticipate this year. Last year they basically had $384 million worth of lettings; this year $653 million and next year Kathryn, $964 million. So when we're seeing those types of numbers in the infrastructure, it really does give you a lot of confidence, particularly in those states.  But the other thing that I think we feel moved by is the strength that we continue to see both the non-residential and residential. If we are looking at res total permits in our states were up 9%, which is almost double the average in the US. Single families up 7%, again 2% better than the overall U.S. and multifamily is up 15% in our markets; that's almost three times the national rate. So remember non-res in many respects we’ll continue to follow that.  So if we think about what we believe has happened with infrastructure, returning to something that feels more like a 10 year average of up nicely over at 45% of our business; a healthy non-res, good solid res and then we come back and look at simply what customers are telling us. So if we are listening to our customers, well out here is this, our customers along the Atlantic coast have three million tons more work right now than they did last year. If we are looking at Southwest that number feels more like 15 million tons and if we are looking at our aggregates business in the Rocky Mountains, last year at this point of time they had about 50% of their revenues booked, this year more like 64%.  So we’ve got some very attractive numbers, but you ask the right question Kathryn, that is how do you factor in weather? Here’s how we think about that. We're thinking and planning for wetter than usual. We are not planning for apocalyptic, but we are planning for wetter than usual. We think based on the last several years, that's simply a sensible way to go about it and then that's the way that we try to factor it. But emerging infrastructure, continued private sector gains, a full year of Bluegrass and modestly better weather is really the way that we are trying to capture the year. I hope that's helpful and responsive. 
Kathryn Thompson: Yes, it is. And then my follow-up question is more on free cash. As we look forward, could you discuss the free cash ramps in ’19, what are the relative puts and takes and thoughts on uses of cash in ’19? Thank you. 
Ward Nye: Well, I’ll ask Jim to address that with more specificity. Look the short answer is, we are going to have an embarrassment of which is a problem. So when you think about that, because if you think about the sheer cash this business kicks off, it’s very attractive. I think we are well positioned to capitalize this as we obviously raised the dividend mostly last year, but let me turn to my colleague Jim; of course he can speak to that in more detail. 
Jim Nickolas: Good morning, Kathryn. As always, the first call on the capital is the right acquisition, there's no change. That will be the case in ‘19 and beyond. Beyond that reinvesting in the business, our CapEx spending should be close to flat versus ’18. We spent 376 in ’18, it will be flat in ’19, $350 million to $400 million for the same zip code.  And then next as I march down our priority list, retuning capital to shareholders. As Ward mentioned, we increased the dividend last August by 9%. It’s not a typical increase. I'd expect something larger than typical this year subject to, obviously our board approval, and then in ’18 we resumed our share repurchase program. We bought back 100 billion of our shares in ’18, we like to continue to repurchase shares in 2019 as well. And then of course, we'll continue deleveraging by paying down debt. We are above our target leverage ratio and we are going to pay down debt until we get into that range. So those are the areas we are going to focus on. As you know, our cash flow is back half loaded, so that's when most of the cash deployment will occur, and it’s kind of level set some changes in ‘19 verses ’18. We contributed $150 million in discretionary for pension plan in ‘18 that will not repeat in ‘19 and slightly offsetting that we expect our cash taxes to be closer to $90 million in ‘19 versus something closer to $30 million in ’18. So hopefully that answers your question. 
Kathryn Thompson: It does, thank you. 
Ward Nye: Kathryn,. thanks a lot. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms : Hi, good morning everyone. 
Ward Nye: Hi Trey. 
Trey Grooms : Ward, I know you guys are baking in the kind of range of 3% to 5% pricing in aggregate. Can you give us you know any additional color on your view on pricing and aggregate that as well as on cement pricing as you look into 2019? 
Ward Nye: Sure. I think it’s going to be an attractive pricing year this year. One thing that’s worth saying and the 3% to 5%, keep in mind when we bought Bluegrass, we said their pricing was about 10% to 15% below our heritage pricing. So when you are looking at 3% to 5% remember that's fully loaded with Bluegrass’s is pricing in there that's lower than ours. So number one, factor that in.  Number two, even if you are looking at the fourth quarter this year, and I think this is an important thing to remember from a momentum perspective. If you just look at it, optically you see pricing in the fourth quarter in the mid-two’s. If you take out some of the profit from mix that we saw on the quarter and so what I really mean by that Tray is we sold a large amount of sand in central Texas and some sand in parts of North Carolina that's simply a lower priced product.  If we really even it out, for product mix, we were seeing pricing even in the fourth quarter more around 4%, which is the same thing that we would have seen for the full year. So keep in mind that was 4% in 18 on what was basically flat heritage volume.  We are going into a year where I think volumes will be better; you know obviously we’ve done some transactions during the course of the year. So we feel very good about where we sit with pricing going into the year.  The other half of your question was relative to cement and how we see that, and as a reminder what we put out is an $8 ton cement price increase affective April 1. We feel very solid about that and where we sit on that today. I think that's particularly true in North Texas. I think we feel fine about central Texas, but I think we feel particularly strong about North Texas.  One thing that's worth adding is we have added some outlets to our cement businesses as well. As you may recall, we built a new sales yard in South Texas, near Houston at New Caney last year. We're selling both stone and cement at that facility and we will be selling some cement in West Texas out of Odessa as well. So again, we think we see a healthy pricing environment in both aggregates and instrument across our footprint. I hope that helps Trey. 
Trey Grooms : Yeah, absolutely Ward, thank you. And just for clarity, you did mention a 1% negative mix I think from product mix on pricing. As you look into ’19, is there any impact that you are expecting on the mix front there? 
Ward Nye: No, we’re not. So the only impact that I’d rather specifically call out is what I’ve already said relative to Bluegrass, but it’s separate and distinct from that, not so much Trey. 
Trey Grooms : Got it. Okay and then my follow up, looking at the guidance, it looks like you guys are assuming you know something around the 60% incremental margins range for the aggregates business and you know I know that has been your outlook for the long term incremental in this business for a long time. More specifically as we look into this year, can you talk about some of the key drivers, kind of the puts and takes that you see in that ramp in profitability versus you know what we saw an ’18.
Ward Nye: Yeah, Trey if you go back and think about it, we actually came into ‘18 and we set the incremental would not be at 60% coming into ‘18 for a host of reasons, including what was going on we believe geographically. What we are seeing this year is more of a typical return to the types of business that we expect to see in the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia. Bluegrass obviously helps in that respect as well. So I think number one if we simply look and see where some of the geographic positioning is going to be, we think that's helpful.  Number two, you know candidly last year when you had apocalyptic whether, it was tough at times to keep the cost profile under control the way that we would typically like to. We see that being candidly more normalized this year. Energy results were spiky last year in some respects. We don't anticipate the same degree of spikiness in energy and I think we expect another very attractive year in Colorado.  One of the things that we've been able to do in Colorado over the last several years is really be very constructive commercially with what we are able to do with our aggregates business there. As you may recall, when we required that business it was actually on the lower end with some of our pricing. That's a tough market to get into and we've been very constructive. We think we are getting fair returns in that market. I think that will help our incremental as well. 
Trey Grooms : Okay, I'll pass it along. Thank you very much and good luck. 
A - Ward Nye: Thanks Trey. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is now open. 
Stanley Elliott : Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Well, you mentioned the Bluegrass integration and how well that's been tracking. You know I think I remember like $15 million of synergies. Can you update us on you know what you found out with that asset thus far and then you know my second question would be, you mentioned M&A in the coming year or at least kind of at the top of your capital priorities. I mean what are you seeing in that market after what's been a pretty active you know go this cycle. 
A - Ward Nye: Good morning Stanley, thanks for the question, a couple of things. Yeah, look I remember that $15 million synergy number too, so I’m right there with you. Stanley we're going to do better than that, we're certainly tracking ahead of that and I really need to complement our immigration teams and people in the Mid-East, mid-Atlantic and Southeast who are making that happen.  So if we step back and say, how has Bluegrass done? Bluegrass has done extraordinarily well. You know we were looking at a year last year that was one of the wettest years in Maryland, a very wet year in Georgia and we were still seeing EBITDA margins from that business that were consistent with what we thought we would see going into the business. So we're excited about the way that that's working. Again, I think we are tracking ahead. Well, I know we are tracking head on synergies, so I'm pleased with that. So there's no aspect of that business that has been troubling or surprising to us. In fact it's everything that we thought it would.  Looking forward, here's what I would say Stanley. People look at a company like ours or frankly others in this sector and you know part of what I spelled out in our opening comments is we’ve been a public company this year for 25 years and during that 25 years we haven’t done quite 100 transactions, but we’re in the zip code of having done 100 transactions in this industry and there is still room to go. And what I would say is, we’ve seen 25 years of consolidation. I think you still got another 10 years plus of seeing that type of activity.  Now the size and scope of it will always be – it will ebb and flow and often times it’s going to be opportunistic, because family businesses will sell for a host of reasons. They may sell because of succession; they may sell because of tax reasons; they may sell because of cyclical reasons. So you never know going into a year, exactly what you are going to see, but what I would say is this.  Financially I think we are extraordinarily well positioned to continue to be a leader in industry consolidation, and the other thing that I would say is I think in attractive markets that you would like to see us grow in, I believe we have the regulatory capacity to do that as well. So I'm not going to make predictions just yet on the sheer scope and size of transactions we may see this year.  A couple of years ago, I had indicated I thought it would be a year of large transactions and mercifully I was right, but I think it will continue to be a year of transactions, but you know what, I'm going to say something like that for the next several years, because I think it's simply right and true. Does that help Stanley? 
Stanley Elliott : It sure does. Thank you very much and I'll pass it along. 
A - Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. So just thinking about the volumes in ’18, flat heritage you know and if there hadn't been you know some of the issues with the underlying market demand, you might have ended up probably closer to mid-single digits. How are you thinking about just how depressed the volumes were in ‘18 and whether or not that could drive any make up volumes in ’19? I know it doesn't always work that way, but is it – are you assuming that some continuation of some raininess maybe kind of keeps us to just that mid-single digit volume growth or is there any potential that you know the ease of the comps in ‘18 might benefit ’19.
A - Ward Nye: Nishu, first welcome to the call. We are delighted to have you following this sector and welcome you. With respect to your question, I think it’s really different and what I would say is back to the notion, planning for a wetter than usual year. So I think that would tamp things down a little bit otherwise, but I think the numbers still are attractive.  You should hear the things that really moved me as I think about it. When we go back and we talk about some of those numbers I mentioned before, looking at almost 20 million tons of business that customers say that they have at this time of the year, that they didn't have last year, those are really big numbers. Most of that's driven by public works and part of what you know about public work that’s so different from others. When public work is committed, public work is going to go. So if we are looking at that degree of public work in Texas, in the Carolinas, in Colorado, in Georgia, in Florida, that really does give you a lot of confidence.  The other piece of it that I’d continue to think is moving is we see good, steady, non-residential light work. But you know also when we are looking at non-residential work we continue to see what we feel like is going to be pretty attractive work that’s coming our way on the heavy side of that as well.  Anyhow, part of what we haven't spent a lot of time talking about are those large projects in the gulf, but we talked about you know a dozen or more of those projects and what I'll tell you right now as we think about it is three of them are already underway and we have them under contracts. There are five more that we see decisions being made on in 2019. If we just look at those five, and that's Magnolia LNG, Golden Pass. Exxon has another big project down there, so LNG, Rio Grande LNG and Driftwood.  If we just look at those five and really tally up what those numbers look like, that's about 1.8 million cubic yards of ready mix. It's about 8.6 million tons of aggregates and nearly 0.5 million tons of cement. So anywhere we pivot right now, whether its infrastructure, non-res or res on those big three, the numbers and the activity and what we believe is coming looks pretty compelling and when we go back and tally up what we feel like, it's some of the work that almost always in a year like we had last year gets pushed to the right. It doesn't go away; it just gets pushed to the right.  I think those are the things that really underscore five year and six to eight and again we'll have to see how weather plays in there. But again, I think we’ve taken a very responsible view of weather. Is that helpful Nishu. 
Nishu Sood: No, no, that's great. And kind of continuing along those lines, I just wanted to ask into some other assumptions as you are thinking about them for ’19. On the volume side, you know the constraints at the contractor level, logistics issues, what kind of assumptions are you making there for ’19? And then obviously with the backup in oil, you know what are you thinking about for you know the margin impact of potentially lower diesel and other energy costs? 
Ward Nye: Well, let’s stick to that. One, I would say relative to what's going on with the labor, let’s talk about contract and some labor. The AGC put out a survey result here not long ago and 79% of construction firms are planning to expand their payrolls in 2019. So we think that's a very, very good sign that they recognize they have to have the talent and in many instances we are simply going to have to pay more for it and that's something that we anticipated.  With respect to logistics, we do see logistics getting better. We don't see them wholly going away, but we see them remarkably better. So Nishu, if you think back to it, one of the primary issues that we ran into last year was rails and the movement of rail, because we moved more stone by rail than anyone else and what I'll tell you is the performance and the conversations that we've had, whether it’s been with CSX or BNSF or UP, have all been very, very constructive and we see a better, you know considerably better and improve transportation year in ‘19 than we saw last year.  You know the good point relative to energy and we'll talk about that for a second. We just gave you a snapshot into Q4. Q4 relative to diesel and that is the biggest single smog of what we deal with in energy. Q4 was $5.1 million higher, 23% above last year and 11% more gallons and of course the gallons for us was primarily being driven by the acquisition of Bluegrass. So here's your snapshot and here’s what I think is particularly relevant.  If we look at Jan 2019 diesel prices, they were $0.33 below where they were in Q4. So we’re surprised by that and I think you are entirely right. We're going to have probably an easier build as we go through the year. If you are really wondering how in the world we utilized that $47.5 million gallons of diesel, it’s probably worth just noting somewhere in the back and in Q1 we use 10 million gallons in Q2, 12.7 million gallons and in Q3 12.8 million gallons and in Q4 11.9 million gallons. The one thing that I would remind you is in Q1 we did not have Bluegrass.  So what I’m trying to do is give you a sense, very directly to your question, what we see happening with labor, what we see happening with transportation and what some of the inputs are relative to fuel. I’ve probably given you 10% more than you bargained for, but I hope that was helpful. 
Nishu Sood: That’s great. Thank you for the details. 
A - Ward Nye: Thank you, Nishu.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Thank you. I just want to ask about downstream in some of your margin assumptions in ready mix, yeah. 
Ward Nye: Garik, are you there?
Garik Shmois: Yes, sorry can you hear me?
A - Ward Nye: I can hear you now. I'm sorry, you broke up on me for one second there. Can you repeat what you said? Yeah, I was looking for more color in your downstream businesses, particularly in margins with expectations for asphalt, particularly with some potential decline on inputs and then on ready mix considering 2018 is a challenging year for ready mix and ready mix margins will be [inaudible] 2019.
Ward Nye: So let’s talk about a couple of things. We’ll put asphalt first and we’ll pivot over to ready mix. So if we’re really thinking about asphalt and some of the key points that I think of as we go into the year. in 2019 we’ve had 30 asphalt projects that were planning about 1.2 million tons and last year it was more like 17 and about 549,000.  So what I would tell you year-over-year, that's looking considerably better. But what we have if you recall, the only asphalt play we have is up and down the front range in Colorado. So again, it’s a very refined play and we think we’re in the right place for that.  One of the issues that I had outlined before is Colorado DOT is in a very different place this year than they were last year. So the planned advertisements as they referred to in their lettings as you and I would typically refer to them, well $653 million is well above last year's at 334 and again, part of what I had outlined before is this can surge up to 964 by the time we get to ’20.  So if we're looking at a backlog right now in asphalt and paving, it's up over 50% from where it was last year. So keep in mind, part of what I spoke to is that there were fewer but larger projects last year that had more people bidding on fewer projects. We see a very different situation in Colorado this year and we think it's going to return to something that feels much more as it would have historically and more normalized.  With respect to ready mix, I would say two very distinct things. We have ready mix in the Southwest; we have ready mix also in Colorado. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that really is a tale of two businesses, right, and that what you were seeing attractive pricing in Colorado, you were seeing tougher pricing in parts of Texas. I think a lot of what was happening in Texas was in fact weather driven. What I would say in Texas is this – We've seen strong infrastructure work in Texas; we’ve got nice looking backlogs there, good work at places like The Grand Parkway and Houston Hobby Airport. But the area that we think is going to be most moving in ready mix this year will be in the non-res sector.  So for example, if we look in the metro plex and you ask specifically about Dallas, Fort Worth, it gives you a sense of school bonds in Dallas of $1.5 billion Dallas County; Tarrant County, which is Fort Worth, $1.2 billion. Collin County, right there in the same area, $1.8 billion and over 19 million square feet in the construction pipeline on just broad industrial distribution type work.  We also see good steady residential work in Dallas, Fort Worth and what we think is an improved res environment in San Antonio. And the other thing that we've done is we've restructured that business a bit as well, so we consolidated five Texas districts into the same nomenclature you would typically hear us speak to in aggregates, so you will hear us talk about north, central and south.  So we think we've got a more attractive undermined business demand. We actually think the pricing situation is better there as well and so what you'll see is doing effective paper one, is going out with varying degrees of price increases, pretending to be somewhere between $5 and $10 a cubic yard. Garik, was that helpful?
Garik Shmois: Yeah, that’s very helpful. Just on infrastructure, if you look out over the next two to three years, recognizing that you are seeing very good growth and extremely healthy backlogs for 2019. But with the fast exit to expire in 2020, I was just wondering if you could speak to the sustainability of growth in a maybe more uncertain federal funding environment over the next several years. 
Ward Nye: You know one thing that I would encourage you to look at is the way that these different states deal with that very much themselves and what you’ll see is, number one, I think we will have a successor bill to the fast exit. So I don't sit here with a high degree of concern around what happens in that respect.  The thing that I do think is most telling and helpful is to look more specifically at the way different states fund transportation differently and how much of what state are doing are driven either by the federal government's budget or state governments and what you’ll find when you look at states like Texas or North Carolina or Florida, is that they are remarkably not depended on what's coming out of the federal government. In fact I think some questions were put the people at NCDOT and others and they said, okay what would have happened had this federal shutdown extended? And NCDOT would have said, look, we could have kept going and we would have been just fine.  So I guess what I would say, when we refer back to that nearly $30 billion worth of funding that was passed in November, when you look at that and consider that each one of our top 10 states over the last five years has put in additional funding mechanisms and I still believe of all the things that the administration and the Congress can find common ground on, transportation infrastructure is still one of them. We look at that even beyond the expiration of the fast track right now and we do not have a high degree of concern. 
Garik Shmois: Okay, thank you very much. 
A - Ward Nye: Thank you, Garek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Collin Verron of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Phil Ng: Hey guys, this is actually Phil. I appreciate a lot of color you provided on your footprint exposed to some of the more attractive demographics in Resi, but the mid-single digit growth for next year seems pretty strong, implies an acceleration from 2018. Resi is probably an end market. You have a little less line of sight versus let's say commercial or infrastructure. So you just want to get some cover on how confident you are on the demand front for Resi in particular. 
A - Ward Nye: You know the primary thing that we think of on Resi flow is really what do the global communities look like and we are seeing a continued very attractive drive on that. So remember, it's not as much just building of the home, it’s the building of the subdivisions. So what’s going in the roads, what’s going in to the curb and gutter, what’s going into the utilities.  So again if we are looking at our top 10 states and we're looking at permitting and remember permits lead starts. So what we would see in permits in our leading 10 stages is they are up 9% versus the U.S. gain about 4%. So important gains in our top 10 in both single and multi-family activity and the single is going to be something that we care deeply about.  Eight of our 10 states are very positive on this, with Florida, Georgia, and Indiana even up double digits and both Texas and North Carolina are up 7%. So again, we see very attractive housing activity and we feel like that's going to continue to be our friend in 2019. Does that help? 
Phil Ng: Yeah, that’s a helpful thought. And just sticking with the theme on the private side, we really appreciate the color that you provided on some of these bigger and new projects that you have in the pipeline for non-res. But curious, you know implicit your guide, how much of that – some of these projects that are kind of secured at this point are reflected in your guide versus some of the other projects you highlighted that could you know get a green light in ’19, you know be incremental, provide some upside and when we think about these projects, I would imagine they're going to be able to multi-year projects. But any color on how to think about you know how long do these kind of projects usually last would be very helpful. Thanks?
Ward Nye: Yeah, here is what I would say Phil. If they are secured and we've gotten them under contract, they are into guidance. If they are not secured and they are more of ‘sure would be nice to have’, that's not in the guide. So that that's a pretty bright line up on the way for you think about that . With respect to the tenure of these projects, they tend to be multi-year, so I think if you are just thinking about it very broadly, I would think about it in two to three year charges. 
Phil Ng: Okay. Thanks a lot, appreciate it. 
Ward Nye: Okay. Thank you, Phil. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Q – Ben Burud : Good morning everyone. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. 
Ward Nye: Hey Ben.
Q – Ben Burud : We are just hoping you guys could expand on the bridge that you lay out on slide 11 in your presentation. So it looks like your heritage aggregates profits were down about $29 million year-over-year. Can you just give us an idea how much was lower production versus a year ago and what were the other variables that offset the pricing improvement in the quarter?
Jim Nickolas: Yeah, so it’s Jim. The primary driver, again comparing versus the prior year was the inventory build. We’ve built inventory in Q4 of ‘17 that did not repeat in Q4 of ’18 and now is about 3.2 million tons. So that was a $60 million headwind in the quarter alone. Now, I don’t like really looking at this for – you know it’s very powerful quarter-to-quarter. The inventory build change can swing results quite a bit, it did that this quarter. So its trends of nature but it did happen in this year.  The other big item we’ve got for this quarter, Q4 of ’18, higher group medical insurance costs and to a lesser degree higher workman's comp. Again, that was about $10 million for this quarter versus prior year quarter four, and I would say that's more of a – you know we're looking at you at Q4 ‘17 with pretty federal comp for those two things and so it's normalized in Q4 ‘18 this year but from a comp perspective it’s a headwind. 
Ben Burud : Got it. And then on slide 13 you are guiding to EBITDA growth that seems to be substantially slower than the gross profit growth you highlight. Can you provide some color as to what is driving that disconnect? 
Jim Nickolas: Yeah, I think we had some – in ’18 we had some EBITDA wins with some settlements and some sales of properties that helped improve our EBITDA. We don’t expect to those to repeat in ’19. So that’s what counts as the difference. Those were EBITDA not gross profit in ’18. So that’s why you are seeing the difference in ‘19. 
Q – Ben Burud : Got it, thank you. 
Ward Nye: Thank you, Ben. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is now open. 
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question on aggregates pricing. Ward, do you think that kind of building as you go through the year or do you think it jumps up in Q1 and just kind of stays constant?
Ward Nye: No, I think it can vary from market to market. I think there are a number of places that aggregates price increases are going into effect in April. So I think you'll see some movement there and I think there's always the prospect in different markets for mid years depending on how tight specific markets get. So I don't think we're in a position to talk specifically about where or whether those will occur, but I think it’s a practical matter. April is where I would start really pegging that type of movement in Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, and then I also wanted to ask about ready mix concrete margins, you know down a bit in Q4. Just I wanted to get your thoughts on when that reverses. I mean is it possible ready mix margins are down in the first half and then up in the second half or do you think the recovery is faster than that?
Ward Nye: Well, I would say a couple of things. One, remember where the ready mix business is right. So we had a very wet October, in fact the wettest October in 124 years in Texas and that’s our single largest ready mix market in what historically is a very large ready mix month. So you take a pop in the chops there from Mother Nature. The other thing I would remind you is the balance of our ready mix is really up and down the front range. So what I would tell you is don't expect the line out of ready mix in Colorado, in January, February and March. So as you look at the business and its natural build over the course of the year, given the fact that a decent bit of business is rocky mountain driven. I would clearly be looking more to Q2, Q3 and early Q4 for that business. You know I did mentioned before, I think we do have a more attractive pricing environment in Texas this year than we did last year. I think I mentioned earlier that effective April 1 we are looking in many respects for $5 to $10 per cubic yard that’s going to help on the margin and the other thing that I did mention before is we have had some restructuring of that business and we've gone from five districts to three. So remember the aim is really to be in those mid-teens relative to margins and that business Adam, so that’s how I would think about that longer term. 
Adam Thalhimer: Perfect! Thanks. 
Ward Nye: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities. Your line is now open. 
Craig Bibb: Hey Ward, in the presentation you referenced the improving backlogs and then in the Q&A you talked about different components of were the backlog is going up. Kind of, what’s the overall increase in backlog and revenue? 
Ward Nye: Yeah we don’t keep it in those exact terms Craig. In many respects what I’m doing is trying to give you a snapshot of what we hearing relative to our customers with respect to their backlog. So what I’m trying to do is give a good snapshot of where those customers are saying we’ve got big work that’s coming.  This is what the work looks like compared to where it was last year. And that’s why I called out in particular over 3 million tons that customers have articulated in the mid-Atlantic division, 15 million tons in the Southwest, over 1 million tons in the Midwest and then I did talk to degree about how much business has been booked in the Rocky Mountains this year versus last year. But I'd rather not go into specifics on revenue etcetera. We’ll talk about that as they play out during the course of the year. But I think these underlying trends give you a tremendous sense and vision of where the business is likely going.
Craig Bibb: And with those larger projects, have you locked in pricing as part of your confident in producing.
Ward Nye: We typically in larger projects what you would do is you will price on an annual basis. So you’ll go in and if it's a multiyear project you'll give prices per size, per year and then you have escalators on those as well. So the answer is yes. 
Craig Bibb: Okay and then with the three large projects on the Gulf coast are under way, and you have two more coming. When do the next two come in and should we be looking for volume to accelerate in Q1, because it's really is the comparison.
Ward Nye: What I’d said was there three along the Gulf that has been awarded to Martin Marietta and those are in our guidance. And what I’d said was there were five more that have estimated start date in 2019, but in essence we are in the running part. So again, we haven’t included any of those in our guidance or any of those in what you might view as backlog or otherwise. 
Craig Bibb: Okay, and the three that are awarded, when do they kick-off.
Ward Nye: The ones that are awarded are underway. So again, they would be in the guidance that we have out there today for you Craig. 
Craig Bibb: Okay great. Alright, thanks a lot guys. 
Ward Nye: Thank you, Craig. 
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. 
Mason Marion : Hi, this is Mason Marion' on for Mike. Bluegrass pricing remains about 10%, 15% below your organic average. Are you working to close this gap if possible at all or is there some structural reason why this gap will persist? 
Ward Nye: You know I guess I would say a couple of things Mitch. If you look at Bluegrass pricing in Georgia, probably relatively close to our heritage pricing in Georgia. If you look at Bluegrass pricing in Maryland, probably modestly below. If you look at Bluegrass pricing heritage in Kentucky, it is below. So what we are doing is we are going across portfolio and giving you a snapshot of what it looks like when you blend it.  Obviously you can go back and look at the history that we had in earlier acquisitions when you are clearly – we try to assure that we are getting good and appropriate value for our products, you saw that in the aftermath of TXI. So I'm trying to give you a sense of what our history has been on transactions like this and what the different geographies look like. I think that probably leads you to the conclusion that you you'd like to work towards. 
Mason Marion : Okay and then Resi was weak in Q4. Did you see a rebound in January, like some of the other Resi focused companies that have report already, in any areas that are particularly weaker, stronger, than us?
Ward Nye: Well I’ll tell you, I usually talk about the quarter that we are in right now when we come back and report, so I won’t go into a lot of detail on that. The one thing that I will share with you and you probably seen it as well, is certainly what I have heard from the home builders is that they saw a pullback in Q4 when interest rates were more aggressive, but they also said that they have seen a nice pick up since interest rates have stabilized and they have a more stable view going forward.  So again, I think if we go back and look at those Resi numbers that we spoke of a little while ago and looking specifically at the permits, and four we said relative to national averages. I like where we sit and it sounds like the Home Builders are at least telling publicly the type of story that tends to work very well for Martin Marietta.
Mason Marion : Great, thank you. 
Ward Nye: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. 
Brent Thielman: Great, thank you. On the infrastructure side, Ward has the Georgia market lived up to expectations in terms of new work heading the street. I seem to remember that being an area of real promise, but had seen some delays. 
Ward Nye: I think it seen some delays, but we started to see much better activity, particularly in North Georgia last year. Remember that you’ve really got two different markets in Georgia. Market number one is Atlanta, market number two is everything else, and I think what we're going to see this year is we're going to see a better market in the Atlanta market place, which we welcome because now we have a bigger footprint in the Atlanta market. Also South Georgia has been good and steady. The T-SPLOST program that was put in place in there several years ago has been very attractive and parts of south Georgia and the activity, particularly now is being driven from the ports and a wader Panama Canal is helping that part of the state as well.  So remember Georgia is really – Atlanta and then everything else and in the other market its Georgia, it’s Florida, because again to gran it, in some respects particularly in south Georgia that we are producing finds its way into a very attractive Florida DOT market. So again, if we come back and say what are the DOT states or states from a DOT perspective that we are looking good, we would certainly put Georgia in that bucket. But we think places like Texas and Colorado and North Carolina are looking good. We think they are looking extraordinary. 
Brent Thielman: Yeah, okay, and then Ward I wanted to get your bigger picture thought, just around diversification and you know Texas has been around, called out throughout the business for a while. I know it's been a fantastic market over the years and probably will continue to be here in the next couple of years. But as you point out in the deck that market is sort of beyond mid-cycle demand and I’m just curious where if you think about Martin Marietta in a longer term, is that a percentage or portion of the company you are still comfortable being in? 
Ward Nye: You know it’s been an out sized percentage the last couple of years in large part because places that should have been a bigger percentage warrant at the normal percentages. So if you look at a place like North Carolina that’s still considerably below mid-point; in a place like Georgia that's considerably below mid-point and Maryland that’s considered to be below mid-point. As those states recover, you know frankly from a percentage perspective it may – its put taxes in a much more normalized place and number one. I think looking at it as you say bigger picture and a more holistic fashion, I think that puts Texas in a better picture. The other thing that I would remind you is we are not all over Texas, I mean our footprint in Texas is uniquely driven by what's going on in that Golden Triangle where you've got just such a disproportionate amount of people there. It was interesting, we had a large meeting of our top 100 employees in Martin Marietta several years ago and we had an economist who came in and the economist was absolutely positive that Texas was going into a recession several years ago.  And what I will tell you is all of our people who live and work and breathe in Texas, and that’s a lot of them by the way, looked at us and said, I don’t where he is coming from, but we don’t see Texas going into recession. We see that market the way that you do. We think it’s very, very attractive. I agree it’s beyond mid-point, but their population trends, their DOT budgets and otherwise dictate that they should be there. So we do not see anything in Texas that in any respect feels overbuilt to us. So I think what I would tell you is we like our Texas position and we like what we think is going to be a more return to normal for the Carolinas, Georgia and Maryland and we think that snapshot puts Texas in a very appropriate perspective and I hope that was helpful, and I know that was long-winded and I apologize.
Brent Thielman: Thanks for the color, Ward. Best of luck!
Ward Nye: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schrier of Citi. Your line is now open.
Scott Schrier: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about – Hey Ward. I wanted to ask about West pricing. So we have this robust aggregates pricing in Colorado that you’ve been talking about, which is offset by mix in Texas and I’m curious if you could talk a little bit about – I don’t know how specific you can get on the aggregates pricing environment in Texas more on a like-for-like basis.  It seems like even taking that into account, it’s a market that’s maybe not having quite the robust price increases as some of your other markets and I understand it’s very strong market as you’ve said many times across the different end markets, but it’s also its above mid-cycle from a consumption perspective, there is a decent amount of supply. So I’m curious, what’s the amount of lettings activity expected, the Gulf Coast work, everything, do you see possibility for better pricing in Texas or is it a market that even with this such robust demand, it’s going to be more of a moderate pricing state?
Ward Nye: You now but if you go back over the last several years, I think Texas has had somewhere between really good pricing and good pricing, and in the spectrum of things we’ll take anything in that zip code.  I think when you compare it to Colorado, one of the candid differences is barriers to do anything heavy side in Colorado really are very, very high and I’ve commented to people before, there are three large granite quarries in Denver today and in 30 years they are probably still going to be three large granite quarries in Denver and I think that drives some of the delta between the two. What I would say is this? I think Texas will continue to be an out-sized performing market on volume. I think Texas pricing in the course of time continues to get better, and as I look at it, I wish it was modestly higher? Sure, I think anybody would wish it was modestly higher. But I like the trends that we’ve had there; I like the leading position that we have there. You know how we tend to look at a market, and if I’m thinking about the top 10 things or top 50 things that I worry about if it gives you any comfort, aggregate pricing in Texas is not on that top 50 worry list right now.
Scott Schrier: Great! That’s a helpful answer. And then my follow-up I guess one for Jim. I wanted to talk a little bit about how you are thinking about free cash flow conversion. And I know earlier in the call you know Ward said that you have a business that throws off a lot of free cash.  If I’m thinking about roughly $1.23 billion of EBITDA, the CapEx, the tax, the interest and historically maybe you’ve been around that 25% to 35% free cash flow conversion. So do you think for ’19 given all your guidance, are we in the $400 million range for free cash flow, or if I’m thinking about working capital and other things, is it possible to take it up to $500 million? Just trying to think about how to bracket free cash flow and what you’re thinking from that perspective?
Jim Nickolas : Yeah, I think you are optimistic assumption is probably more accurate. We’re doing pretty good in 2019, we should have higher cash flow conversions, close to where you came out at.
Scott Schrier: Great! That’s really good to hear. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck!
Ward Nye: Scott, thank you. As I said, we’ve been an embarrassment of riches when it comes to free cash flows and you know – but we’ll take that problem, it’s a high class one. I want to thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. Our steadfast focus on safety, efficiency and operational excellence positions Martin Marietta to deliver continued growth, success and superior shareholder value creation. We believe 2019 will be another record year for Martin Marietta, and we look forward to discussing our first quarter 2019 results with you in April.  As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amanda, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available, during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q3 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for third quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue. Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses, the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting, and restructuring charge. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2018 supplemental information and SEC filing. We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance as well market trends heading into 2019. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta continues to benefit from an improving construction cycle and the strength of our operational performance. We achieved record third quarter revenues, gross profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and diluted earnings per share. And we delivered these impressive results while successfully managing near-term challenges from historically high levels of precipitation. We estimate weather negatively impacted third quarter profitability by $40 million to $45 million. Importantly, as noted in today's earnings release, we remain on course to once again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year and are well-positioned for continued growth in 2019. We're confident that the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets and a wide range of factors support steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing in the near-to-medium term. Specifically, for the third quarter, in July and August, we experienced more manageable weather patterns. Consistent with our internal expectations, aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete shipments meaningfully accelerated and pricing also improved. These trends highlight the attractive demand environment across our geographic footprint, particularly in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa and are wholly consistent with our broader expectations. In September, we experienced extraordinary weather, including Hurricane Florence and record Texas rainfall pausing the third quarter's earlier momentum which is typically our industry's busiest and most profitable period. These notable disruptions impacted more than half of our Building Materials business as measured by revenues. Regardless of underlying market strength, Mother Nature can temporarily interrupt construction activity. Hurricane Florence made landfall in Eastern North Carolina not far from the South Carolina border. This event affected at least 15 of September's 19 selling days as the region was either preparing for, enduring and/or cleaning up from the storm. Indeed this unusually slow-moving storm produced torrential rainfall and widespread inland flooding throughout the Carolinas, leaving an estimated $17 billion of damage and over 18 trillion gallons of water in its wake. That's enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay. And 10 billion gallons of it filled our Castle Hayne and Belgrade quarries in Eastern North Carolina. While Texas was not affected by Hurricane Florence, the state experienced its wettest September in the last 124 years. Dallas/Fort Worth had nearly 13 inches of rain during the month, while San Antonio received nearly 17 inches of rain, almost 14 inches above normal. Texas is our largest state by revenues. With aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete operations throughout the Texas Triangle, the negative financial impact of September's record rain fall was considerably more significant than both Hurricane Florence and last year's Hurricane Harvey combined. Most importantly, we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe in the aftermath of September's severe weather. Our thoughts, prayers and relief efforts are geared toward those affected as they rebuild their lives and communities. As a company, we manage what we can control. We've initiated pumping activities at flooded North Carolina quarries and systematically resumed sales at the vast majority of our affected locations. Since North Carolina is our third largest state by revenues and our leading state by unit profitability, Mid-America Group shipments, pricing, production and margins have been disproportionately negatively affected in the near-term. However, we view this situation for precisely what it is, temporary. As we've seen historically, emergency repairs to houses, businesses and transportation networks are critical in the early days and weeks following natural disasters. Reconstruction efforts typically require years of steady building activity with increased demand in heavy side building materials. Importantly, we remain appropriately focused on our tactical day-to-day decisions and mindful of the long-term aspects of our business. We know the dynamics of our industry, the varied needs and abilities of our communities, customers and suppliers, and how these forces coalesce. That's why Martin Marietta's course has been fashioned around macroeconomics reflecting the powerful demographic and related trends that we see as so critical to overall success in our space. Accordingly, our leading market positions, disciplined pricing strategy and execution of our strategic plan position Martin Marietta for further growth and shareholder value creation as the ongoing construction cycle continues for the foreseeable future. To be clear, in our view, the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets. In fact, many of our most attractive areas, while growing, are still well below mid-cycle shipment levels. Further, it remains difficult to see an end to this recovery when the long-awaited arrival of increased infrastructure activity has only recently begun in earnest. Throughout our geographic footprint, we see no signs of either a slowdown or markets that are overbuilt. To the contrary, employment and population trends, together with the solid fiscal health of our key states, support steady and sustainable construction growth in the near-to-medium term. Our optimism is further bolstered by favorable pricing trends, typically an indicator of underlying market strength. Now, let's review the third quarter operating results in more detail. Heritage aggregate shipments adjusted for third quarter 2017 volumes from the Forsyth County, Georgia quarry we divested in April 2018 grew 4%. We estimate heritage volume growth would have been closer to 12% absent the noted weather headwinds. Public construction activity is typically the most weather-sensitive sector due to strict Department of Transportation specifications and performance standards. Accordingly, heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market were flat as large public projects underway in North Carolina and Texas were delayed. Importantly, we're encouraged by the recent acceleration in public lettings and contract awards, most notably in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and by improving rail service. The percentage of our heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market remains below the company's most recent five-year average of 43%. As state DOTs and contractors continue to address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform, infrastructure construction activity should continue to be bolstered from the funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act. Additionally, state and local initiatives such as the infrastructure funding proposals included on Colorado's ballot today show a growing grassroots effort to relieve traffic congestion and improve commute times. State and local initiatives have historically garnered strong voter approval and we believe they will play an expanded role in public sector activity. Heritage aggregate shipments to the non-residential market increased 5% in the third quarter driven primarily by data and distribution centers as well as wind farms. Consistent with third-party forecasts, non-residential construction activity should continue to increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years in key Martin Marietta markets. Additional federal regulatory approvals supported by higher oil prices should notably contribute to increased aggregates consumption from the next wave of energy sector projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Construction activity for these projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and beyond. The nonresidential market represented 33% of third quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Heritage aggregate shipments to the residential market increased 7%. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina consistently rank in the top 10 states nationally for growth in single-family housing unit starts. Inclusive of Iowa, Maryland, and Indiana, growth in single-family housing unit permits for our top nine states is outpacing the national average. Looking ahead, regional residential construction growth should continue as supported by employment and population gains in our key markets. And while mortgage rate increases may temporarily dampen the growth of housing starts, once stabilized, the residential market will adapt and continue to strengthen. Our view in this respect is not based upon blind optimism and hope, it's fact based. Specifically, housing starts have yet to return to historical levels despite notable population gains. We see the homebuilding industry is just beginning to address the shortage of single-family housing units that exists, particularly for entry level homes. Our leading positions in southeastern and southwestern states offer superior opportunities to benefit from this expected growth. Furthermore, continued strength in residential construction supports future infrastructure and nonresidential activity. The residential market accounted for 20% of third quarter aggregate shipments. To conclude our discussion on end uses, heritage aggregate shipments to the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining third quarter shipments and increased 6%, reflecting improved balance shipments for Midwest and Rocky Mountain Divisions. Heritage aggregates pricing improved 3%. The combination of product and geographic mix lowered the company's average selling price by $0.13 per ton or 1%. The Mid-America Group, which includes the Carolinas, posted heritage pricing growth of nearly 3%, reflecting the impact of weather and a higher percentage of lower-priced ballast shipments. Product mix muted heritage pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2% as our offshore operations opportunistically shipped more lower-priced sand material. Double-digit pricing growth in Colorado was partially offset by product mix and reduced long-haul shipments in Texas, resulting in a 3% increase in West Group pricing. Factoring in expected full year product and geographic mix, heritage aggregates pricing is expected to increase 3% to 4% for 2018. The recently acquired Bluegrass Materials operations remain on track in 2018 despite Maryland's second wettest year on record. As a reminder, selling prices for these operations are 10% to 15% below our corporate average. Synergy realization is progressing ahead of plan. Cement shipments and pricing increased 8% and 3% respectively, reflecting positive demand in the vibrant Texas economy. Importantly, both our Midlothian and Hunter operations reported double digit volume growth prior to September's record rainfall, highlighting the underlying demand in our Texas markets. Our cement business has recently announced an $8 per ton price increase effective April 2019. Turning to our downstream businesses, ready mixed concrete shipments increased 3% with solid gains throughout the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Divisions despite September's record rainfall in Texas. Overall third quarter ready mixed concrete prices increased 3%, with solid improvements in most markets. In Colorado, project delays and permitting issues led to the 9% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments. Pricing was relatively flat as more contractors bid on both a reduced number of as well as more geographically concentrated Colorado DOT projects. This transitory situation should improve in 2019 with greater Colorado DOT funding and more dispersed public works. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our third quarter financial results.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Ward. The Building Materials business achieved products and services revenues of $1.1 billion, a 12% increase and at all-time record for the company. Gross profit increased 7% to $288 million. These results include a $61 million product revenue contribution from the acquired Bluegrass operations and adjusted gross margins comparable with our heritage Mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations. Overall, aggregates product gross margin was 30.4%, which includes an $8 million negative impact related to selling acquired inventory after it was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding this impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 31.6% or relatively flat compared with the prior quarter despite weather disruptions and higher diesel expenses that negatively impacted our quarterly cost and efficiency profile. As Ward mentioned, our cement operations benefited from volume and pricing growth in Texas, leading to a 210-basis point expansion of product gross margin to 33.1%. Magnesia Specialties once again posted record revenues and profitability as the business benefits from increased global demand for magnesia chemical products as well as strong domestic steel production. Operating efficiencies and lower unit energy costs contributed to a 370-basis point expansion in product gross margin to 39.2%. During the third quarter, we commenced a planned restructuring initiative to consolidate 20 sites and the associated mixer truck fleet for Southwest ready mixed concrete operations. These actions are designed to improve the long-term profitability of the Southwest business. We incurred a $7 million restructuring charge, which was recorded in other operating expenses for the West Group, for related asset impairment and severance costs. This restructuring should pay for itself in less than 12 months. Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase 305,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $60 million during the quarter. In addition to share repurchases, our board of directors approved a 9% increase to our quarterly cash dividend payment in August. This is one of the larger percentage increases in the company's annual dividend, and indicative of our positive business outlook. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, including throughout the long years of the Great Recession. We have now returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. We also made a contribution of $150 million to our qualified defined benefit plan during the quarter. As a result, this plan is now fully funded and we were able to deduct these contributions out of 2017 federal income tax return at a higher rate compared with the new lower corporate federal income tax rate for 2018. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.72 times. We expect to be modestly above the top-end of our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times at year-end, remaining well within our covenants in our credit agreements. 2018 capital expenditures are currently expected to be $375 million down from our initial full year guidance of $450 million to $500 million. This reduction is largely a function of managing project timing as well as prioritizing projects focused on capital efficiency and higher returns. Martin Marietta will continue to further shareholder value by opportunistically deploying free cash flow through growing dividends and share repurchases, as well as value enhancing acquisitions improving organic investment, all while returning to our target leverage ratio. We remain on track to again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year. As detailed in today's release, we updated our full year 2018 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations. We now expect heritage aggregate shipments to range from flat to up 1% and heritage pricing to increase in the range of 3% to 4%. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues to range from $4.135 billion to $4.255 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.100 billion to $1.145 billion. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. We're confident about Martin Marietta's outlook given the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and our attractive geographic footprint. Looking ahead to 2019, we anticipate mid-single digit growth in both aggregate shipments and pricing. The demand for our construction materials combined with widespread customer optimism is strong and we see no signs these dynamics will abate in either the short or longer term. Importantly, we have the ability and capacity to meet future market demands. Remember, our overall aggregate shipments are still 10% below mid-cycle demand with key states such as Georgia and Maryland, home to the majority of the former Bluegrass operations, along with North Carolina, 20% to 25% below mid-cycle demand. We fully intend to benefit from the strong underlying demand dynamics and believe the current construction cycle will continue to grow at a steady pace in 2019 for each of the company's three primary construction end-use markets. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First, just focusing on the 2019 outlook, really a two part question. What gives you confidence for the mid-single digit volume and pricing for 2019? And then layering on that with the acceleration of public lettings in Texas, Colorado and Georgia, could you talk about the types of projects you're seeing are these overlay or larger type projects as extensively that would play into your 2019 outlook? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, Kathryn. Thanks for your question. I think part of what you just said answers the first part of it. So, if we come back and say, looking at state lettings and contract awards in Florida, they're up 21%. In North Carolina, they're up 65%. In Texas, they're up 33%. So when we're looking at that type of activity in the public area where, as you know, over the last several years, it's been below 40% of our volumes, we think this is good evidence that it's heading back toward more traditional areas as well at least on a percentage basis, because as you recall, we typically range from 45% to 48%, not less than 40%. So if we're looking at that and we expect more public activity, we think that's actually very good. We think in those states it's very good. Here's what we also see, we're seeing more design-build work and design-build work typically means larger, more complicated projects. In many places, we see this replacing some P3 work, which we actually think is really quite good. So, from your perspective, Kathryn, they're larger jobs. They're more complicated jobs. Oftentimes, they have multiple primes. And those types of work are typically from the ground up. And what I mean by that is you'll see the entire array of aggregate products from base material at the very beginning of projects to clean stone as it's incorporated into asphalt or concrete as we go through. I think that's the biggest piece on infrastructure. We also feel good about non-res and we feel good about res. If we're looking at the Dodge Momentum Index, that and the ABI both remain positive. We're looking at the next large wave of multi-year energy projects coming into Texas, really, as we go into 2019. And the other thing that strikes us is, in Martin Marietta markets, housing still remains very strong. We're looking at housing numbers this year that are still well below the 50-year average of 1.5 million starts. We see that there's not enough new or existing homes available to meet current demand. We're talking with homebuilders and listening to their commentary as well and they're seeing strong housing fundamentals. And I think the other piece of it that's important is if you think about where the majority of our footprint is, it's southeastern and southwestern, and we feel like those geographies really offer superior opportunities for housing in the near term and the longer term. So I hope that answered both parts of your question, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: It did. And tagging onto infrastructure, aggregate shipments were flat in the quarter. Given North Carolina, Texas weather delays, if the weather had been sustained in July and August through September, any idea how shipments would've shaped out?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I think if we had seen that go the way that we thought it would, I think shipments would have been up 12% for the quarter, and that's very much in keeping with what we thought. Seeing that type of a double digit performance for the quarter was wholly consisted with what we see in underlying market demand. And that's what gives us the type of confidence that we have looking into 2019 as well, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. And then shipments in the Southeast Group increased nearly 12%. Is this a sign we're seeing improved long-haul distribution in the Florida yards, is this a signal of easing of bottlenecks in rails or other factors? And maybe just, because rails have been such a focus for this year, any color on that would be very helpful. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Kathryn. I think it's twofold. Number one, business was better in Atlanta and we think that will continue to be the case. And number two, business was improving at the Florida yards. Florida DOT has a very good DOT budget this year. They're going to have a very similar looking budget next year. And obviously, the more we see going into Florida the better. Keep in mind the southeastern pricing still would have had a headwind relative to more lower priced sand products coming into that market from offshore as well. So what I would say is, as we look at that overall market, we think it's attractive and we think it's early attractive.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. 12% heritage volumes in aggregates export, it was certainly very strong. Can you parse out what markets really stood out for you given some of the bottlenecks you were seeing in rail and labor? Is this level of shipments stable as we look at 2019?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, Phil. The markets that were particularly looking good, Mid-Atlantic was looking good; North Carolina was demonstrating good attractive growth. We were seeing good attractive growth in the Southeast. We were seeing attractive growth in Texas when the weather was dry and we were seeing attractive growth in the Midwest when weather was dry. So as we look across the vast majority of our footprint, we were seeing good activity in all of them. And the other thing that I think is important, Phil, is as we look into 2019, what I would tell you is each one of our division presidents think that they're going to have a better 2019 than they did 2018. So, I hope that's helpful.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. And in your ready mix and asphalt business, margins were under pressure a little bit. Asphalt, I would imagine a good chunk of your business is more of a pass-through dynamic for liquid asphalt. Can you help quantify that and how quickly can you be caught up? And on the ready mix side, (28:09) was up, but did weather limit some of the momentum in Texas? And how should we think about margins there being all caught up? Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Absolutely. So, if we look at the ready mix business, what I would say is twofold. A very attractive healthy ready mix business in Colorado; we were clearly weather affected in Texas. You still saw volumes up in Texas despite the fact that it was the wettest September on record. So, I would say those would be the primary drivers relative to the Texas business. If we think about asphalt all by itself what I will say is this, you had larger projects in Colorado this year, but there were fewer of them. So, you had large projects more focused around Denver. So, as a practical matter, you were seeing more contractors vying for fewer but larger projects. We think that rule is actually changing next year and we're likely to see much more work up and down the I-25 corridor, which is what we've typically seen. You might have seen that, really, even as we got toward mid-year, the general tax revenues in Colorado were so attractive that Colorado was looking to let a good bit of work in calendar year – calendar quarter Q4 right now. So, again, I think that was the single largest driver relative to hot mix. And you also had liquid pricing moving up. I do think, in many respects, that's going to be helpful relative to hot mix pricing. That's not something we're particularly concerned about because most of our projects are indexed in that state, and we do have our own storage facility not far outside Greeley. So, again, Phil, I hope that was helpful.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck with the quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Schrier of Citi. Your line is open.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just looking at the aggregates margins and, obviously, there's a lot of noise in there with fixed cost absorption, efficiencies and costs. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about the overall environment, say, for markets that weren't impacted by weather or North Carolina, Texas when they were dry, of how did the price cost and how the operating efficiencies are looking in aggregates currently.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: When the volumes are working the way that we saw the volumes working in July and August, Scott, the cost profile, the pricing, everything else is actually working just as you would expect. You nailed it. The fact is, if you look at a North Carolina and a Texas, which are two outsized disproportionately important states for North Carolina, when those two have the types of events that we saw in Q3, we're going to feel it. So, actually, as I step back and take a look at the business, recognizing what it had endured in those two states and the results that we put up, actually feel quite good about that. And again, I think to the extent that you believe as we do that 2019 is going to be a year where you see good volumes in those states. I think it actually portends very well for what we see in the year ahead.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then just following up on your earlier comments on design-build, obviously, you can control what you can control and there's a lot of external factors that have, I guess, you, us, investors, everybody frustrated with how volumes are going. And the one thing I'm thinking is it's really good that you're talking about these larger type projects. We see it in the transportation awards that the projects are getting larger. But, with that, does that carry maybe a higher tendency for certain projects to get cancelled or more lumpiness and ongoing delays? I guess I'm just worried or concerned or what do you think that if we sit here 12 months today on the earnings call, the commentary will talk about what would have a lot of large projects and backlog, but these kind of projects get delayed. So just any color around how you see that playing out.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: My general view is design-build jobs are ones that we should celebrate, because if you go back to some of the things that I think you've heard from the industry over the past several years, at times, some of the holdups have been in getting design work out of DOTs because of labor constraints. I think to the extent that you're seeing large JVs come forward with design-build projects in today's environment, I think that actually serves to accelerate contract delivery and execution. The other thing that I believe that I think is really going to help Scott is, keep in mind, the more public work we see going on, particularly design-builds or others, these typically will have good hard finish dates relative to them. And I think that's also going to keep good pace to the overall construction activity. You don't see that as much in non-res. You clearly don't see it as much in residential. So, as I look at a higher degree of design-build, I actually view that as good news for the industry and, in that context, I mean the building materials industry.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Ward, can you talk about the cadence of pricing that you've seen over the course of this year and what have you seen for aggregates, specifically in terms of competitor pricing discipline. How has the situation evolved this year compared to last year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think this year has gone – if you look at where we're guiding, we're guiding very much within the range that we talked about at the beginning of the year. What I'm seeing right now relative to next year actually looks to be a better environment in many respects because I think people recognize the underlying demand is so strong. Here's something that we can look at internally, Jerry, and I think it underscores why we feel good about the pricing. We're going into 2019 with all of our downstream businesses having the largest backlogs in their history. And what we're hearing from many of our customers is they're in the same place. So, as a practical matter, it's not unusual for a sophisticated downstream customer to not want to run away from a price increase because, in many respects, that helps them in their business all by themselves. So, at this point, we'll obviously come out later with more definitive guidance relative to pricing in 2019. But we're certainly seeing clean stone increases in many areas between $1 and $2 a ton. And I think that actually gives you a great snapshot of what we're hearing relative to demand and how people are looking at 2019.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And as you think about the cost structure from here, this year in a challenging weather environment, you're going to be growing EBITDA touch faster than sales. If we see the picture of mid-single digit volume and mid-single digit pricing playing out next year, I guess, can you go back to seeing EBITDA growing three times the level of sales growth or any moving pieces we should keep in mind about the cost structure in 2019 versus 2018.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I think much of it goes back to some of the commentary that we made in the prepared remarks. And that is take a look at the part of the country that's still operating considerably below mid-cycle and if you start seeing the type of performance out of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and others that certainly population trends would indicate, those are some of the most powerful places in which we operate and that would clearly drive EBITDA in some very different ways. The other thing that I'll remind you is coming into the year this year, obviously, cement has had, again, what I think is a pretty attractive year. But we also came into the year having done a large capital project on our Midlothian plant last year. And we were a little bit slow coming out of the gate in January and February in the cement market in Texas. So, again, if you think about what I believe is going to be a very attractive Texas cement market next year and a very attractive southeastern and Mid-Atlantic aggregates market next year, I'll let you do the math. But, again, I think those are markets that probably help answer your questions as well as anything.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet: Hi. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Mike.
Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet: Can you talk about industry bottlenecks, Texas in particular? I'm curious when pent up demand gets released in more normal weather, what are the industry constraints to growth in particular public spending and non-res?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think, from our perspective, there is not any. So if you're looking at it purely from a Martin Marietta perspective, we can put on the ground whatever contractors require. I think one of the issues the contractors are working through right now is simply relative to labor and what's going on with respect to trucking. And here are a couple of things that I would point out to. In a host of our markets, we're simply seeing contracts working longer hours and working weekends. That's not a surprise. The end of the year is coming. We're also seeing truck driver shortages being addressed in several ways. We see, in a number of markets, $1,000 bonuses being given to drivers. Drivers are being given free healthcare. But here are some stats that I think are important to keep in mind, Mike. AGC put out a report in August of 2018 and 62% of contractors have turned to base pay increases because they recognize they need to get more people in to do the work. And I think if we come back and say, has labor been an issue for contractors through this year? It absolutely has. Has trucking been a shortage? It has. I think people are addressing it. One of our large contractors here in North Carolina would tell me he's going to have a record year and every day there are 10% fewer trucks available than he wishes. But that's not something that I think is going to persist. So, again, I do think rail has also been a bit of a bottleneck this year. I do see that getting better. You can listen to the earnings calls from the different Class 1 railroads. I think they're very focused on dealing with this, and we do see progress in that regard. So are there bottlenecks? There are. Are they on our end? They're not. Do we see them in large part getting better? We do.
Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet: That's helpful. And since it's election day, are there any mid-term votes that you're watching in terms of state level infrastructure propositions that you might want to call our attention to?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What would tell you is, let's all watch that together. I think ARCO (38:44) would tell you that there are over 300 ballot initiatives on various ballots today. That gives you a great feel for simply how many projects there are out there and how many jurisdictions are looking at it. One of the things that we would just watch, because we're curious, we're anxious to see how things go in Colorado this evening. We think Colorado is going to be in a great place if nothing happens. But, keep in mind, there are two different ballot initiatives in that state this evening. One inspirationally called Let's Go, Colorado, and the other a little bit more bluntly, Fix Our Damn Roads. So we'll watch that carefully and see how that shakes out.
Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet: Great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, there. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Quick question on the CapEx spend and the deferral piece. Does that slip into next year? How do we think about CapEx? And I guess the root of the question is that you're too 7-ish right now, I mean it's not hard to think that you guys could get below 2 times in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA next year and I'm just trying to frame up some of the casual implications.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Look, I'll address the CapEx, then I turn it over to Jim to give you a little bit more color. Here is what I would say, look, we've been spending CapEx above DD&A for the past several years. And I think we've actually spent it very well. I think if we're looking at something below $400 million this year as we really look at the full year, I would tell you that's probably not a bad ZIP code for you to start thinking about next year as well. We're going to be focused on CapEx that really gives the type of return that we expect and you would expect, so we probably will see that dial back just a little bit. But I know your question was more than just about CapEx, so let me turn the balance of it over to Jim to respond.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. So, Stanley, the company's capital allocation priorities are unchanged. The first call on capital is the right acquisition that will enable our successful execution of our growth plan, followed with investing in business in organic growth and CapEx that Ward mentioned being relatively constant for the next year. And then beyond that, returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful, sustainable dividend, all while targeting – and the share repurchases, all while targeting our 2 to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Just going to point out, in the last six months, we've completed the second largest acquisition in the company's history, which was all cash and debt financed. Since then, we've de-risked the balance sheet, paying down debt and funding our qualified defined benefit plan. Additionally, as we mentioned, we bought back shares in Q3, $60 million worth. It's been about 11/2 years since we repurchased shares. So we're back in the market. We also increased the dividend 9% this August. So, we're feeling very good about our future. And with the equity market sell-off of late, we view our shares as cheap and we'll be actively considering share repurchases. We'll be opportunistic with a balanced approach with our cash flow. But, again, given our positive outlook for the future and our expectations for growing earnings, share repurchases will be funded through cash flow from operations going forward. We are focused on lowering our leverage to within our target ratio. We're going to keep strengthening the balance sheet. But, again, given the cheap stock price, we're going to be looking at that as well. All in all, we're taking a balanced approach and we expect to fund the needs of the business, repay debt and repurchase shares, all while de-levering over the next 12 months.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: And Stanley, I guess the punch line is we've got a high-class problem. I think we're going to be in a place that we can fund our CapEx the way that we need to. I think we do transactions really well. I think we've got a team that not only does the transactions themselves well, but I know we have an operating team that makes them perform extraordinarily well. And again, being in a position that we can take a look at share buybacks and doing things like we're doing with the dividend puts us in a very attractive spot and we're going to enjoy this and take advantage of it.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no doubt. And then the aggregate pricing sounds very good. Cement pricing, you talked about the $8 per ton. Can you talk about kind of the confidence? Sometimes the cement pricing tends to be a little more volatile, I guess. What are you seeing in the Texas market that gives you confidence that the $8 is a good number for us in the coming year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, what I would encourage you to do is just do some other channel checks and get a sense of where you think competitors are there as well. And my guess is you'll get some comfort when you look at that. That's certainly what we're seeing is as we hear from customers and others in that marketplace. I think the other piece of it goes back to some of the commentary that I offered before, and that is the downstream business' backlogs are really very, very high. And this was a year in which cement was relatively tight in Texas. I think you could certainly see that next year as well. And again, the location of those plants and where I think we are in the cycle is what gives me the type of confidence around that that I have as we go into 2019.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Appreciate the time and congrats on a nice work in a tough year.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you so much, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Hi this is Jeff Stevenson on for Garik. My first question is on weather impacted markets and how long North Carolina, for example, takes to normalize. Do you expect this to potentially bleed into next year? And if so has it factored into your guidance?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I don't think it's going to bleed into next year. Obviously, it significantly affected the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did have two quarries in the eastern part of the state that ended up being a catcher's mitt for a lot of floodwater. What I'll tell you is, sadly, we have gotten pretty good at this and we build up inventories at those eastern locations recognizing that if a hurricane comes along we need to be able to sell material. So I don't think we're going to be in material shortage land around either Belgrade or Castle Hayne. Those are the two quarries had been filled with water. We are undertaking pumping at those quarries. My guess is, if we're looking at Belgrade, it's probably four months to six months to get the water out of there. Castle Hayne actually has a little bit more. It has about 8 billion gallons of water in it. That's probably going to be closer to six months to nine months. However, I do not anticipate that being a market situation as we go into next year. We're going to have to run some pumps. That's going to cost us modestly more money for some period of time. But I don't see that being something that if I'm you and I'm modeling out 2019, I'm not putting that very high on my worry list.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Great. Great. And I just had a question on incremental margins for next year. With the potentially stronger demand environment and relatively easier comps, could there be any upward bias?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, again, I'll take you back to geography. We will give you a good view of 2019 when we come out in February, so I don't want to get too far over my skis right now. But, obviously, what we see right now for 2019 looks attractive and I like the geographies, Jeff. So I'll leave it at that for right now.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Okay. And then lastly, cement guidance was put down slightly, I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on the buckets driving that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think primarily it was September rains. That was your big single issue. But I know Jim had some comments on cement as well.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: If your question's on Q3, it was September rains, if your question's on Q4, it's the rains we've already seen in October so far for Texas.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: So we've tried to take everything we've seen into account with a full year of the little bit that's left in 2018.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Right.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Got it, thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hey, good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Ward, I want to start first on the ready mix pricing, which increased over $5 sequentially, just curious what drove that.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I'm sorry, what my take was on that?
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: On ready mix pricing, yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, clearly, you've got a very attractive ready mix market in Colorado with high barriers to entry and a very good ready mix business. I think, clearly, we were seeing the type of increases in Texas that you would expect to see, given the types of backlogs that are there and what I think can be a tightness in that market in many respects. So, I think in most regards, Adam, it's the sign of a good healthy marketplace with good underlying demand. So, I think those are your primary drivers.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: So there's nothing unusual in Q2 that can stay at that level.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, there was nothing unusual in Q2. In fact, the things that were unusual in Q2 or Q3 were more things in our face, not things at our back.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: And then the aggregates pricing for 2019, how does that – does that start to flow through mostly in January next year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It varies. Some price increases will go in in January, some increases may go in in April. Look, if you're sitting where I am and where you are, you've got a bias toward January. My guess is most will go in January. I think a good number will go in April. And the simple fact is, construction doesn't really get underway in earnest until the second half of March. So it's more of an optical issue than a real issue, but I think you'll probably have most go in in January, you will have some that will go in in April.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Okay. Thanks, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our commitment to operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan positions Martin Marietta to drive shareholder value as we continue to benefit from the steady multi-year construction recovery. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions with you. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Martin Marietta Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ashley and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the Company’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website Q2 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on slide two, this teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for second quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter, unless otherwise noted, and all margin references are based on revenues. Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses and the impact of selling acquired inventory after its mark-up to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q2 2018 supplemental information and SEC filing. We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our second quarter operating performance and market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. And a question-and-answer session will follow these prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta achieved record second quarter revenues; profitability; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA; and diluted earnings per share. These impressive results were driven by disciplined execution of our strategic plan as we continue to operate safely and efficiently while benefiting from the steady, ongoing, multiyear construction recovery. Our strong second quarter results reflect increased shipment volumes in our Building Materials business, continued pricing momentum and contributions from completed acquisitions. We're especially pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Bluegrass Materials operations, which remain on track to ship approximately 13 million tons of aggregates this year at overall EBITDA margins of at least 50%. Integration is substantially complete and synergy realization is progressing as planned. In addition to our aggregates-led growth in the eastern United States in late June, we also acquired several sand and gravel operations and a permitted Greenfield site in Omaha, Nebraska, adding approximately 30 million tons of aggregate reserves to our Midwest business. These growth initiatives, both large and small, demonstrate that our prudent capital deployment strategy is delivering significant value to our shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. Looking beyond this quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable market trends, ongoing customer optimism and positive third-party forecasts. Underlying product demand and customer backlogs remain strong, most notably in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, and Iowa, underscoring the strength and health of the markets in which we operate. We expect increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2018 and into the future as the construction recovery strengthens. This sentiment is echoed by our sales teams, customers and suppliers. Consistent with these trends, 2018 is shaping up to be another record year for Martin Marietta. And as announced in today's release, we raised our full-year EBITDA guidance to a midpoint of $1.235 billion. Demand for our construction products is growing, and we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contract capacity and freight constraints compounded by lost weather days that are difficult to recover can meter the pace of construction activity. Our second quarter results illustrate this point as railroad service issues, finite truck availability, and contractor labor shortages slowed overall second quarter heritage aggregates volume growth to 3%. This is still solid growth but not enough to satisfy demand for our products at this time. Fortunately, we expect these temporary bottlenecks to ease and throughput to improve as the construction sector attracts capital investment and provides increased wages. For the first time in 24 months, heritage aggregates shipments increased in each of the Company's three primary end-use markets. Heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2%. Our Mid-Atlantic Division posted double-digit volume growth, driven by several large public projects in North Carolina, including the Interstate 77 Express Lanes in Charlotte and the Greenville Bypass in the eastern half of the state. Unplanned project delays in Texas and Colorado as well as continued poor railroad service in Texas, South Georgia and Florida limited infrastructure shipments and construction activity in these regions. We expect sustained but manageable railroad service issues over the next three to six months. Heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market remained below the company's most recent 5-year average of 43%. As state Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, and contractors address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform, we're confident that funding provided by the Fixing America's Service Transportation Act, or FAST Act, together with numerous state and local transportation initiatives will translate into further increased product demand. We're also encouraged by recent acceleration of state lettings and contract awards, notably in Texas and North Carolina. However, some contractors are reporting a longer lag time between contract awards and project commencement. Public construction projects are almost always completed once awarded, so we know this work is coming. We believe that the impact of these delays, inclement weather conditions and other temporary factors described earlier will extend but not limit the construction cycle of the company's single largest end-use market. Heritage aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased 6% in the second quarter, driven by both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors across many of our key markets. Ongoing energy sector project approvals, supported by sustained higher oil prices, bode well for increased aggregates consumption generated from the next wave of these projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Numerous projects are expected to bid in 2018, with construction activity beginning in 2019 and beyond. The nonresidential market represented 33% of second quarter heritage aggregates shipments. Heritage aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 11% in the second quarter. We believe the home building industry is now beginning to address the shortage of single-family housing units, particularly entry-level homes. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina consistently ranked at the top 10 states nationally for growth in single-family housing unit starts. Inclusive of Iowa, Maryland and Indiana, growth in single-family housing unit permits for our top nine states outpaced the national average. The outlook for residential construction remains robust, particularly in Martin Marietta's leading Southeast and Southwest states, driven by positive employment and population trends, land availability and efficient permitting. Continued strength in residential construction should serve as a catalyst for future nonresidential and the infrastructure activity. The residential market accounted for 22% of second quarter aggregates shipments. To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, heritage aggregates shipments to the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5% of second quarter shipments and declined 21%. Lower ballast volumes reflect both reduced maintenance spending by Class I railroads as well as the timing of purchases by East Coast railroads in the prior year quarter. Heritage aggregates pricing across the company improved 4%. This is despite the fact that the combination of reduced commercial rail shipped volumes and unfavorable product mix actually lowered the company's average selling price by $0.20 per ton. Drilling down to more regional perspectives, continued price discipline led to heritage pricing growth of 6% for the Mid-America Group. Double-digit pricing growth in Colorado was partially offset by product mix and reduced long-haul rail shipments in Texas, resulting in an overall 3% pricing increase in the West Group. Geographic mix limited pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2% as weather and railroad inefficiencies hindered our ability to move higher-priced aggregates product by rail into our Georgia and Florida distribution yards. Aggregates pricing, inclusive of acquired operations, is expected to range from up 2% to up 4% for the full year. As a reminder, selling prices at legacy Bluegrass operations are 10% to 15% below our corporate average. Cement shipments and pricing increased 12% and 3%, respectively, reflecting positive demand trends in the growing Texas economy. This outlook should support future cement pricing opportunities. Turning to our downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments increased 15%, driven primarily by construction activity in Texas, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Overall, second quarter ready mixed concrete prices decreased slightly with lower energy sector shipments and product mix in Texas offsetting gains in Dallas-Fort Worth and the nearly 6% growth in Colorado. The combination of reduced energy sector volumes and product mix lowered our overall ready mixed concrete average selling price by $2.91 per cubic yard. We have recently communicated midyear price increases, effective October 1, in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and ancillary markets. In Colorado, project delays contribute to the 6% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments, while rising raw material costs allowed for favorable pricing during the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our second quarter financial results.
Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. The Building Materials business posted total products and services revenues of $1.1 billion and gross profit of $288 million, inclusive of the $42 million product revenue contribution from the acquired Bluegrass operations at adjusted margins comparable with our heritage Mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations. Overall aggregates product gross margin was 29.8%, which reflects a $10 million negative impact related to selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding this impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 31.4%, a 150 basis point improvement. As Ward mentioned earlier, our Cement business benefited from both strong demand and a tight supply environment. These dynamics, coupled with increased production efficiencies, led to a 680 basis point expansion of cement product gross margin to 36.5%. Magnesia Specialties second quarter products and service revenues increased to a record $68 million. Among other things, this business continues to benefit from increased global demand for magnesia chemical products as well as heightened domestic steel production. Kiln outages, both planned and unplanned, and higher petroleum coke costs contributed to a 120 basis point reduction in product gross margin to 36.5%. Consolidated SG&A was 5.9% of total revenues, a 50 basis point improvement in part due to our realization of acquisition synergies. Earnings from operations were $264 million and include $25 million of gains from litigation and related settlements and surplus land sales. As a reminder, management previously discussed surplus land sales as part of the value proposition for our acquisition of TXI, and that's exactly what you're seeing this quarter. The disposition of surplus land is an ongoing strategy for the company. And while we cannot predict the potential timing of any future land sales, we do expect to announce additional real estate divestitures as favorable opportunities develop. During the quarter and keeping with the company's agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve all competitive issues with respect to the Bluegrass transaction, we divested our heritage Forsyth aggregates quarry, north of Atlanta, Georgia, and the legacy Bluegrass Beaver Creek aggregates quarry in Western Maryland. We recognized the $15 million gain on the Forsyth quarry divestiture, which is included in acquisition-related net expenses. There was no gain or loss on the Beaver Creek divestiture. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation that preserves Martin Marietta's balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million for full year 2018 as we continue to prudently invest in our business. At the same time, we will continue to evaluate value-enhancing acquisition opportunities and return capital directly to shareholders. Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases. In addition, given our strong cash flows as well as the desire and ability to seize the advantages of the late 2017 changes in the federal tax law, we are planning to contribute $150 million into the company's qualified defined benefit plan in the third quarter. For the trailing 12 months ended June 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.75 times, inclusive of the impact of financing the Bluegrass transaction. We expect to return to our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times by year-end. As detailed in today's release, we increased our full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect current results, including the other operating income recognized during the second quarter. For 2018, we continue to expect consolidated total revenues to range from $4,300 million to $4,500 million, and we now expect adjusted EBITDA to reach $1,175 million to $1,295 million. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. And to reiterate, we do not see an end to the current construction recovery in the near to medium term, as years of pent-up demand provide sustainable support for an extension of steady growth. Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from the increasing strength of the current construction cycle. We anticipate growing demand for infrastructure projects and private sector construction activity during the second half of the year with faster growth in our key geographies due to attractive market fundamentals. As Martin Marietta progresses towards another record year in 2018, these dynamics, coupled with our second quarter results, underscore our confidence in Martin Marietta's near and long-term growth trajectory as the construction recovery continues on a steady and extended basis. These favorable trends, together with our strong competitive position, solid balance sheet, superior assets and employees and commitment to safe and efficient operations, position Martin Marietta for continued growth, success and shareholder value creation. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. One of the areas that we have focused on as a firm is ongoing what's going on trends at letting state, particularly as we have influx of dollars come in that are great, but last year was a little disappointing in terms of letting. Lettings flow-through, do clearly appear to be better as we head into 2018. But importantly, I don't want to lose sight on private demand as well. So with that, could you walk through some of the key major regions and markets for Martin in terms of what you're seeing, in terms of rail demand coming forward for public and then also for private? And clarify, what is different today versus last year? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Good morning, Kathryn. Thank you for your question. Look, we agree with you. We aren't seeing a better letting schedule coming out. We anticipated that coming into the year. I think one thing that's notable as we began a broader conversation on that is we're seeing larger projects, we're seeing more complicated projects, and we're seeing more P3 work. And I think all of that is very good from our perspective because it's going to be very aggregates intensive. The only thing that I will note is, on occasion, due to the complexity of these jobs, sometimes, we have been seeing some delays just in owners getting these jobs out. As I said in the prepared remarks, once those jobs are put forward, you know they're going to finish. So we're not concerned at all about the volume in those jobs at all. That's a broad top-side view. I think that's very helpful as we look out, not just in ‘18 but ‘19 and beyond that. Back to your question very specifically on different states, Kathryn, really as I look at our top nine states, I think there's a lot to be pretty excited about. If we look at Colorado right now, it's like ninth in job gains in the U.S. It's growing faster than most U.S. economies. The unemployment rate there is about 2.4%. It's fifth in total housing permits. So we're seeing strengthen here in both single and multifamily. To your point, it's not just a public story right now, it's public and private. If we're looking on the public side of that, I mean, Colorado's got $1.9 billion worth of bonds for infrastructure coming up in certificates of participation. Their estimates are that it will end this year with a $1.3 billion surplus, and they've earmarked at least $650 million of those dollars for transportation in Colorado over the next couple of years. And then they're also looking at a referendum in the fall, Let's Go Colorado, to raise $2.3 billion in bonds, and that's really sales tax that would be dedicated to transportation. And what they're looking at is, is effectively raising an additional $750 million per year. So, public and private in Colorado looks remarkably healthy. Same snapshot in Texas. I mean, Texas is ranked first in employment growth. Dallas remains first in job growth and one of the best metros in the country. Houston's at 4, showing great progress in Houston. Austin, 17; San Antonio, 25. Those gains in Houston are really important from our perspective. Unemployment there is 3.7%. So again, it's low. Texas is fourth in total housing. It's third in single-family. And part of what I moved by is still tap in multifamily. So, again, this is an economy that recovered far earlier than most, and what we're seeing is still good multifamily activity because I think it reveals the shortness in overall construction in those low-level single-family housing. The other thing that I'll say is if we look at textile, to your comment on public, $8.1 billion in lettings this year. That's up nicely from last year. And what we're anticipating is seeing about a $3.2 billion infusion from Prop 7. If we're simply looking at the backlogs that we have in different parts of the state, last year, in North Texas about $4.2 million, this year about $7.1 million. So again, if we're looking public, private, it's very healthy. Keep in mind. We've also have those large energy projects in the Gulf that we believe are coming that have at least 22 million tons of aggregates and about 2.4 million cubic yards of ready mix. Iowa, another critical state for us, is remarkably steady. Unemployment there is about 2.2%. Remember, they raised their gas tax a couple of years ago. We think good, steady infrastructure is going to be the rule there for a while. And data center activity continues to be very strong. We've seen Microsoft, we've seen Facebook, we've seen Google there, now, we're seeing Apple coming to that marketplace with data centers. Maryland, which is an important state for us now in the aftermath of Bluegrass is sitting there with an employment rate of 3.9%. By the way, 3.9% is the highest unemployment rate in our top 9 states. I mean, 3.9% is the high watermark. I think that tells you we're in a pretty healthy place. The governor there has unveiled 15 preliminary options on Capital Beltway and Interstate 270, and he's looking at a proposed $9 billion project to widen much of that interstate as well. In Florida, again, it's mostly about infrastructure for us, and we're seeing a very strong DOT program that's very consistent with last year's record program. What's important for us in Florida is CSX rail is getting better. What you've heard us say on the last several calls is that's been a bit of a bottleneck for us. Norfolk Southern has had some short-term issues there, but again, we're seeing much better work out of CSX right now. If we're looking at Georgia, the state is seventh overall in job growth, so is Atlanta, 3.5% unemployment. It's eighth in single-family housing permits. And part of what's happening too is you're seeing so much more activity because of court activity there. The DOT has proposed the nation's first all-truck highway. I think that gives you a good sense of how important states like Georgia are seeing moving trucks more quickly and more safely to amp up their competitiveness. We talked about the fact that South Carolina has eventually raised their gas tax. For the first time in a long time, they're putting $0.12 over 6 years. That's been one of our healthiest markets. And perhaps most importantly, here in our home state in North Carolina, we're seeing much, much better activity. It's top 6 in employment growth, top three in housing permits growth, a much improved DOT outlook, it's fifth in employment. Charlotte is 19th, North Carolina unemployment rate is 3.7%. It's second in residential permits. So what we're seeing here on the private side is attractive, but here's what's important. We're seeing good public work that's coming as well. NCDOT is spending down its cash balance very, very quickly. Build NC is a process that went successfully through our legislature. It's going to basically add $300 million a year for 10 years on bonds. So again, as we look at our top 8, 9 states, Kathryn, both on public and on private, we like the snapshot that we're seeing overall. I know that was a long answer, but I thought your question was a good one. I wanted to take a little bit of time to talk through those.
Kathryn Thompson: Sure, and that's helpful. And a my follow-up question, and then I'll get back into the queue, is really about the forward look. You raised guidance on EBITDA. But can you give more color on the drivers for the upped guidance, including to what extent have you factored in headwinds that are facing this market, including tight labor, rail, as you noted in your prepared commentary and your response. The other just basic transportation on roads logistics. So how have you -- how much have you factored those headwinds given the visibility you have with volumes?
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. I guess, a couple of things. When we came into the year, we actually said there are going to be several swing factors. There will be headwinds to your point. We said labor tightness would be one of them. We said there's always a prospect of atypical weather. You're always looking at Class I rail performance-wise truck shortages and just macro issues. So I think it's fair to say we have come out exactly where we thought frankly better in the first half of the year with a number of those headwinds there. We actually think the rail situation is getting modestly better. So as we look at second half, several things. One, I would say that last year, you recall, we had 2 major hurricanes that hit us in Texas, Georgia and in Florida. So from a comp perspective, it should get easier as we go into the second half. The other thing that I would tell you is we don't have a labor issue in Martin Marietta. The issue that we're faced with is clearly we have the ability to put all the stone on the ground that contractors could meet. The issue is going to be whether contractors can take that stone from our quarries or sales yards and get them to their jobs. We think that's going to start to ease moderately in the second half of the year. And as we look at the outlook, we think the underlying demand is there. We think logistics are getting better. Our contractors have significant backlogs. The more public work we have, the more liquidated damages contractors are going to have if they can't finish that work on time, and we think that's part of what comes back and starts to address the labor constraints that we're seeing. So I hope that helps respond to the second part of your question, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.
Phil Ng: Can you talk a little bit more about pricing in aggregates and cement? Is there an opportunity to go for a second increase in the back half of the year in select markets, just because things are pretty tight in these markets? Or is it just more of a 2019 event?
Ward Nye: What I think, Phil, the answer is both. I think the answer is there's going to be some areas that you'll see some price increases in the back half of the year and some that it's going to be more for next year. So if we think about it, here's the way I would bifurcate it for you. Let's talk about cement first because, as you recall, we had an April 6 price increase in cement, primarily in North Texas and in Houston. Right now we have spoken to our customers about a $6 a ton increase in October in cement, so that's obviously an ongoing dialogue. The other thing that I would say is we're looking at ready mixed concrete. We're also done about ready mixed concrete price increases as we get here toward the back half of the year as well. So we're looking at $6 a cubic yard price increases, effective in North Texas and Central Texas. So again, you’re going to that part of the market that I think you've addressed where you're seeing some tightness, particularly in cement, I think that's what we're seeing. I think relative to aggregates, here's part of what's interesting, Phil. If we really go and take a look at the aggregate pricing and look at it very appropriately stripping out product mix and geographic mix, part of what's interesting to us is if you do same-on-same pricing for the overall company, this quarter would have been up 5.9%. So again, we tried to call out what some of the issues were relative to geographic mix because of some of the difficulties with Class I railroads in the Southeast in particular and in the West. And if we look at that, that's certainly affected the optics of pricing growth there. And we talked about some product mix issues, particularly in the West that affected that as well. So if we come back and say, are we looking for price raises in cement and ready mix in select markets in the second half of this year? Yes. Are we pleased with the overall pricing that we're seeing in aggregates as we hit here at half year? Yes. And is that very much in keeping with the type of metrics that we've discussed over the last several years and where we thought we would see the pricing going? I think the answer on that continues to be yes as well.
Phil Ng: Got it. Two questions on that front, I guess. On the mix side of things, I know it's been kind of the headwind for last few quarters. Part of that is the storms and maybe using less clean stone for some of these bigger projects early on. Do we kind of see that mix headwind kind of reverse in the back half or it's going to take a little more time? And then the second question I had on pricing was on cement. Just given the tightness of the market, I would've thought cement pricing would have been firmer for April, but while it is up but not as much as I think some people would have expected, so just curious to get some thoughts on that?
Ward Nye: Okay. With respect to both of those, I do think some of the geographic mix issues will get better as rail service gets better. So, the more product we see moving into South Texas and the more product that we see going into Florida and South Georgia, that will help pretty considerably. I think the other thing as these larger projects become more mature, you're going to see more clean stone go into those. So I do think over time, that that's going to tend to adjust itself. But I agree with you on cement by the way. That's a tight cement market in Texas. I don't see anything that makes this thing it's not going to be at tight cement market. Obviously, it's a very valuable product, and it's one of the reasons that we're looking for a $6 increase in October. So we will see how that goes, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Ward, can you just give us a rough sense of the rail issues? How much they cost you in terms of shipment volumes in the quarter? And you mentioned you're seeing signs of improvement? Can you just give us a bit more context because the 12x for the rails at least in aggregate still looked challenging, but hopefully it's better in your parts of the footprint than what we see reported?
Ward Nye: Two different ways I want to encourage to think about this, Jerry. Number one, the railroads are very good customers of ours; and number two, the railroads are vendors of ours. So we have a bifurcated relationship. On the customer side, they're buying typically ballast from us. We're the largest ballast supplier in the United States. So if we look at ballast purchases for the quarter, they were down about 300,000 tons. And the fact is I think ballast is probably about as low as ballast can get. So I think we feel like there's probably upside on ballast. But for the quarter, that was that 300,000 tons. On the other side of the coin is the commercial work that we do with them. In other words, when the railroads are coming into our quarries, picking up our stone and taking our stone to a sales yard, then we will subsequently sell to a contractor or others. If I break that down between those two geographies, I was just talking with Phil about in the previous question, if I look at what was going on in Texas, number one, and what was going on the Southeast, number two, what I would say is we probably had deferred shipments in Texas all by itself, but modestly over 400,000 tons. If we take a look at what the snapshot look like in the Southeast, it was probably 250,000 tons. So take your full vision of both the ballast and the commercial side, let those 2 things fuse together, and you've got just about 1 million tons of stone that's most likely defer relative to rail in the second quarter. If we had put that back into the volume that we've reported for you, volume actually for the quarter would've been up 5.7%. So to the extent it come back to the essence of your question, do we believe that rail is getting better, particularly for CSX? The answer is yes, we do. Do we see better performance out of Union Pacific? Yes, we do. Are those 2 things important to us and perhaps disproportionately going forward? They are. So do we think they're going to be varying degrees of rail conversations, it will likely occur throughout the rest of the year. I think the answer to that candidly is yes. Do we think it's going to be largely mitigated as we go into the second half? I think the answer to that is yes as well.
Jerry Revich: Okay, very helpful context. And if you look at the high end of your volume guidance, 6% heritage aggregates growth and based on the year-to-date results of flat to down 1%, to hit the high end, we're looking at, call it, 13% heritage volume growth in 3Q and 4Q. Can you just talk about how feasible is that? What was the cadence of demand over the course of the quarter because it feels like a lot has to go right to hit the high end of that volume range. So any context there would be helpful.
Ward Nye: Look, I think to hit the high end of the volume range, I think you're right. And I don't think it's an issue of demand, Jerry. I think it's an issue of can contractors take it. To hit that 4% to 6%, to hit the low end of the range, let’s spend other minute [ph] and then talk about that, basically what we're saying is heritage shipments to the back half must increase over 9% of the prior year period. And the thing to keep in mind is in Q3 2017, we had shipments that were pretty negatively impacted by a record precipitation then including those 2 significant hurricanes that came into both, Texas as well as Florida and Georgia. So if we look at a normal cadence quarter-by-quarter on what aggregates look like, I mean, this is what I would tell you. 13 to 17 snapshots, Q1 is typically 18% volume, Q2 typically 27%, Q3 is usually 30%, and Q4 is usually 25%. In other words, I think people who ordinarily might be surprised to know that Q4 at a typical year is as impactful as Q2. So again, as we look at the balance of the year, you're talking about high end of the range. I'm talking about the lower end of the range. Either way, I think those are your puts and takes, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Okay. That's helpful. And Ward, from a cadence standpoint, can you just talk about how demand stacked up over the course of the quarter? And you mentioned super easy comps in the third quarter. Can you just give us a sense for how shipping rates look in July, just to build our comfort that the easy comps are playing out in terms of that significant volume growth?
Ward Nye: Jerry, as you know, I never talk about the month of the quarter that we're in. So I'll talk about July when we'll circle back and talk to you in November. If we're looking at the way that the quarter itself went, April was up 8%, May was up 4%, June got hit with some rain and fewer shipping days, and June was modestly off 1%. So that was the build as we went into the quarter, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois: I'm just wondering if you could about incremental margins and the outlook in the second half of the year? Understanding that some of the rail inefficiencies might start to ease. But any color on other cost items that might be moving around and could benefit you in the second half in order for you to get to your incremental margin targets for the full year will be helpful.
Ward Nye: Yes. I'll comment that the incrementals, at least for where we are in the year has been right about where we thought that they would be given our guidance. A couple of things that I'll speak to you. But, I'll ask Jim to speak to it more specifically. And clearly, we have had some higher cost per ton issues, most likely related to energy and some higher equipment rentals as well because we are anticipating greater volumes in different parts of the country, and we've talked about those different parts of the country, particularly in the east that we think are recovering but that's at least some top side comments. Let me turn it over to Jim to let him respond to you more clearly.
Jim Nickolas: Yes. So, it's a couple of things. You've got -- we've got implied second half implied gross margins are better than first half actuals better than second quarter. But we're confident these are within our ability to achieve them. We expected the higher diesel costs. Those are there. We're seeing that coming through, but we expected it. But as you look at it in a percentage versus last year, I mean, that hurts from an incremental perspective, if you're comparing second half of '17 to second half of '18, the higher diesel costs have an outsized impact just because of the short time from you're looking at. So I think a better way of looking at it is, second half implied gross margins, and those are, again, something we're looking it's going to be achievable based on the volume and the ASP growth we're expecting. So, it's really not much of a stretch. The one issue that we had in the second quarter, it’s not really an issue, but it's incremental comparison point is that the shipments versus production of aggregates in Q2 were in line. Prior year Q2, we produced 2 million more than we shipped. So, that's a headwind that we have absorbed in Q2. And despite that, we have higher gross margins in Q2. We think we're going to be able to offset the same dynamic in the second half of the year as well. So I hope that answers the question appropriately for you, but it's sort of implied gross margins are improving, but we think it's achievable.
Garik Shmois: Okay. Great to know. That's helpful. Just wanted to follow-up. You provide a lot of color on your infrastructure outlook in a lot of the states. You're not in California, but I just wondered if you could provide a perspective on just the SP1 repeal efforts. Is there any risk that repeal efforts could bleed into some of your markets, given gas tax increases have been core to driving funding increases on the infrastructure side and a lot of places that you service?
Ward Nye: Garik, it's perfectly fair question. I just don't see any underlying effort or notion in these states to do it. I think part of what's happening is if we look at places like South Carolina, I think South Carolina, historically, is about as anti-tax as any place could be. But they're focused on competitiveness, and they understand that they have to make this move if they want to keep bringing people in like Boeing, Continental Tire, BMW and others. Indiana, again, had raised their tax by $0.10 per gallon. Part of what I'm taken with in many of these states, Gary, and this is part of what's different, these are red states. These tend to be broadly Republican states that have done this. And what I would say is if you're seeing gas tax raised in Republican states typically by Republican governors and Republican legislatures, that's a very different conversation than the one that we see and hear going on in California right now. I certainly hope for the sake of the industry that we don't see that type of action undertake in the California, but I do not see any type of movement in that as I look at these big 9 states that are most important to us.
Garik Shmois: And then just a last question just on asphalt, not a big part of your business. But any rule of thumb of how quickly you can recover asphalt margins in the face of higher liquid asphalt inflation?
Ward Nye: I'll answer it in part this way. If you look at our year-to-date shipments in revenue, they're behind plan by 2.7% and 7.2%. But our year-to-date performance is actually better than planned. And what I'd tell you is most of these jobs are indexed. So you're able to keep up with it relatively well. I mean, to your point, clearly, liquid asphalt is up. And then Q2 unit cost was up about 6.6%. So if we're looking at liquid today at about $377 per ton, that's up $23 or about 6.6% over the prior year. But at the same time, we're looking at a business in Colorado that we think is going to be incredibly attractive. The only issue that we have with our asphalt and paving business in Colorado was last year, it's just so darn good. We're just wondering if this year can be better. But everything that we see in Colorado and that business is attractive, and we think we'll make up for that costs really in the back half of the year. It's an odd business because really, this is the time of year when you really start making your money. And we have a very good outlook for that business for the balance of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rohit Seth of SunTrust.
Rohit Seth: I got a question on these transportation issues. When -- you have capacity constraints on the rail, and you can't get materials to the projects. Do these projects get delayed because of material availability? Or do they just switch suppliers?
Ward Nye: Well, again, the issue is not us. It's not that we don't have the ability. Keep in mind, most of what we're shipping is being still at FOB at our location. So really, in most instances, the contractor has the burden on them to come to our quarry and take it there. We also think, in most circumstances, we're locationally advantaged. So as a practical matter, what tends to happen in a lot of these jobs, is they simply become extended jobs. I think it's tougher for contractors if they're in a circumstance they're faced with liquidated damages, and that, that was what I was referencing before. So for example, there's some very large projects right now underway at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Some of those jobs are running behind schedule. At the same time, they're very large LDs on those jobs, not for us, but for contractors if they don't finish on time. We have the material. We have it in spec. We have it on our yards. We have it ready for them. So from our perspective, it's really not so much whether somebody's going to change suppliers because we have what they need. The issue, I think, is going to be, at times, more of an economic issue for the contractor to deal with throughput. And oftentimes, as I said in my prepared remarks, what that may mean is paying more for trucking going forward than you have historically.
Rohit Seth: Okay. And then just on your pricing, year-to-date, you're trending toward the lower end of your guidance range. With North Carolina coming back, I mean it is -- or accelerating, I should say, was that part of your expectation coming into the year? And how do you see your pricing trending as the year progresses?
Ward Nye: Well, again, the more we see, the Mid-Atlantic volumes grow. And the more we see the Southeast grow and the more you see Florida grow, optically and otherwise, that's going to help considerably on ASPs. I think one thing that's worth remembering is if we go back and simply have that discussion that I had just a couple of questions ago, removing product mix and geographic mix, then ASPs would be sitting for the quarter up 5.9%. So I guess, where I'm sitting here, if we're talking about pricing in this environment of under that scenario, close to 6%, that's certainly not disappointing to me. And if to your point, places like the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida are getting healthier, and by the way, I think they are, I think that actually makes what is already a very good pricing story, even better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schrier of Citi.
Scott Schrier: Following up on Jerry's question before, but I think more broadly speaking, and I know you have these easy comps in the back half of the year. But you talk about unemployment rates being so low in a lot of your states, which of course, is a positive. But do you see these labor constraints that we have starting to cap or limit how much you can ship in a quarter? Are there any risk that we might be close to any kind of peak amount of shipments that the market can absorb and things will just be more protracted? If we look at where shipment expectations are in your guide for '18 and assuming folks are looking for mid-single digits in '19, I'm not looking for guidance, but just thinking about kind of the market, is there enough labor to get, say, somewhere around 185 million tons or whatever it may be?
Ward Nye: I think, there's going to be enough labor to do it. I think the wage structure in some places may have to pivot a little bit. And again, I think, to the extent that you're seeing increasing public work that's going to have tighter deadlines, that's going to have tighter specifications and that's going to have more liquidated damage provisions attached to them, my guess is you will simply see of necessity more labor coming into the construction market. But again, the other part of your question I want to make sure that we address it, I don't want people to think of peak in the wrong way. I don't think we're getting anywhere near peak in what's going on relative to volume, certainly not relative to requirements for volume. Again, I think if you go back to the commentary that we put out this morning in the writing, the CEO commentary, you saw our view that this is going to be a continued nice, steady climb. My view is probably for several years. But again, I think, the more public work you see coming in, and I think that's what we're likely to see over the next several years, I think the more you will see labor coming into contracting and labor coming into trucking. It's a perfectly fair statement to say that we have very large contractors in North Carolina right now who would say, on any given day, the market is 10% short of trucks. That's a nice opportunity for somebody, and I'm relatively sure they're going to fill that hole.
Scott Schrier: Great. And then on the ready mixed piece, you had some mix issues that impact Texas. You called out solid pricing in the DFW. I'm curious, on a like-for-like basis, excluding the energy projects, is Houston challenging from a ready mixed price perspective? And overall, just looking at ready mixed, margins weren't bad, of course we're seeing a little bit of compression. Is that mostly due to the labor and diesel? Or are there some impacts from the material spread as well?
Ward Nye: Well, I guess, two -- first things first. We don't actually have a ready mixed business in Houston. So if we look at where we are in Texas, it tends to be more of a central to North Texas business than. We have some in South Texas but not in Houston. If you're looking at just the price increases themselves, we saw Rocky Mountain up 5.9%, we saw the northeast portion outside of the metroplex up about 4%. We saw the metroplex itself up about -- excuse me, about 2.2%. Part of the challenge is, you're looking at most of those markets that are going to be, at least in Texas, somewhere in the mid-90s to low teens in dollars per cubic yard. What happened is when you pull out some of that energy work that we had last year and you're selling concrete for numbers that are much higher than those because, again, it's those large LNG or other projects that we feel like the second wave is really heading our way for more bidding this year and more activity next year. That's more your issue than anything else. Is diesel fuel an issue in that? You bet it is. So that's clearly going to give you some degree of compression. But if you're looking at what's happening relative to price, and keeping in mind, again, we're looking for $6 cubic yard price increase in North and Central Texas effective October 1, it gives you a sense of what's happening in those markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward, can you talk a little bit -- I know it's early, but just your early thoughts on 2019 aggregates pricing?
Ward Nye: I guess the primary metric that you've heard me say for a long time, Adam, is look at what volumes are and then take a look at pricing. And part of what you've heard me say is if volumes are growing at a tepid rate, then you can look back at a more historical rate of pricing. If volume start rising at a 5%-or-more, then watching pricing and volume link up together, perhaps at times, that pricing having a bit of a lag, on a percentage basis, is not a bad way to think of it. That's what we said historically. I will clearly say that we have been outperforming that metric for the last several years. So I may have to come back and revisit the way that I've looked at that. Look, there's a lot of demand ahead of us in '18. I think that pushes a lot of demand and continued new growth in '19. We've talked about some tightness in places like Texas on cement mill. I think all of that conversation is actually very constructive for what we'll continue to be in this industry, in aggregates, in particular, a very attractive pricing market going forward. So I've done everything except give you percentages for next year, which, at some point, I will do. I just won't do it today. But I suppose what I'm saying, I don't see anything that makes us feel like that's going to be unattractive at all.
Adam Thalhimer: Understood. And then, I wanted to ask about an infrastructure bill. Are you guys anymore optimistic that maybe the sentiments improving for a gas tax increase and actually getting something through?
Ward Nye: It was interesting to see what Chairman Shuster did earlier this week, right? I mean, clearly as this Bill Shuster comes out of office, and of course, he's going to retire in January, he really laid out a plan that he knows is not going to be something that he's going to see happen just before he goes. But if you look at the plan that he rolled out here on the 23rd of July, he set out a couple of things: one, it's a plan that provides an additional $123 billion over 10 years and funded by $0.15 gas tax increase and a $0.20 diesel tax increase phased in over 3 years beginning in 2019. Now what he's also done is he's build a framework around because his view, I think, is everyone's view, and that is gas tax and diesel taxes over the long term are not the sustainable way to pay for infrastructure. So if we're looking at it, what we're seeing continuing to evolve and state levels, if we're looking at the way North Carolina or Georgia or Indiana or Iowa or Texas are paying for it, I think the simple fact is, you will likely see continued debate in Congress around the way to make sure they have good funding for this going forward. There is some talk that maybe we'll see some activity in lame duck. We've clearly seen that happen before. My personal guess is that you will not see that happen in lame duck because I think there's going to be a more robust debate around that. But again, I don't have individual conversations with Congressmen or Senators who don't get this. I don't have conversations in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that are not very supportive of this. We don't have conversations with the American Trucking Association, who are not supportive of this. So my view is, yes, we will see it. I think it's hard to nail down exactly what the timing is going to be, but I actually thought what Chairman Shuster did this week was a very constructive step in fashioning the debate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Just kind of touching back on the geographic mix, I know what's impacting pricing, as you mentioned. And then you called out some improvements in North Carolina. And as you mentioned earlier, it does have higher prices, and I understand higher incrementals as well. The incremental margins that are embedded in the guidance for aggregates, in that it still seems like maybe a less favorable geographic mix is still kind of being implied there? I'm just trying to put what you're saying about North Carolina with what's embedded in the guide for the incrementals and aggregates, and just understanding the puts and takes there. And where…
Ward Nye: Now, here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. I think we think half 2 in Colorado is going to be a very impressive half 2. I think we think half 2 in Texas may be a very impressive half 2. And I think when you're having that type of half 2 in parts of the West, that is going to have an effect to a degree on incrementals. I think in part of what we're seeing in North Carolina is we're seeing good activity, but it's good activity that's building for even better activity going forward. The other component of it that I would bring you back to as well though is what's going on relative to energy in some of those markets. Because that's clearly going to, at least in the near term, have an impact on some of the incrementals. But I'll turn it over to Jim to see if he has any other comments that he'd like to offer on that as well, Trey.
Jim Nickolas: So I think, the fundamental building blocks are there. Again, incrementals are comparing versus the prior year. We have the higher volumes coming through. We have the higher pricing coming through. And assuming whether it's normal, all those things should work in our favor. So yes, second half gross profit is higher than first half. But that is not a stretch. So we think that's going to work, again, the fundamental building blocks in place volume and ASP coming through.
Trey Grooms: Got it, okay. And then if we were to just kind of dust off some comments from the past, given some of the changes that have taken place with freight and cost and some of the things you've mentioned, if we get back to a more normal kind of geographic mix, historically, we've been looking forward had talked about this, kind of this incremental margin in the 60% range. Is that -- given the backdrop of the changes that we've seen, is that still kind of the bogey with a more normal geographic mix or has that outlook changed at all?
Ward Nye: Look, Trey, that’s totally fancy [ph] outlook. And I think the key to that outlook is going back to what you just said. If we had continued economic emergence in the North Carolinas, South Carolinas, Georgias and Floridas of the world, that's where we're going.
Trey Grooms: Got it. And then I've just got a couple for clarity here. One is, just to make sure I heard right, Ward. The $10 million that was -- that you guys realized in the quarter from the inventory markup, I believe in the guide, it said $20 million. When is the timing of the rest of that coming through?
Jim Nickolas: That will be coming through in Q3.
Trey Grooms: Okay. So adjust that. Okay. Another housekeeping is the acquisition done in June, I know it's probably not going to move the needle too much. But, did that add to volume or any other metrics as you look…
Ward Nye: It's going to be really very modestly. You're talking about a couple of sites in the Midwest and we're talking about at approximately I want to say 1.2 million tons per annum. So, it’s -- Trey, it's nothing that I think is going to rock your model.
Trey Grooms: Got it. And last one is just another for clarity. Your comment on aggregate, same on same, 5.9% on pricing. Just to be clear, was that comment for heritage? So 5.9% versus the 4.4%? Or was that for the overall?
Ward Nye: Yes. Thanks for the clarification. Yes, that was heritage, correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel.
Stanley Elliott: Ward, what are the -- in the release this morning, you talked about the public being 40% of volumes kind of year-to-date. How quickly can that normalize? And is that really going to be more a function of public accelerating meaningfully? Or is that kind of taking into account the private piece slowed? I mean, how do we think about that dynamic, one. And then two, what does that do? I mean, you talked a little bit about regional impact in terms of mix. What is having a healthier public market do in terms of ASPs, mix, et cetera?
Ward Nye: Just a couple of things. One, I think it does reveal more than acceleration on the public side. Because we don't see a pullback in the private and in the markets in which we are operating. So if we're looking -- go back to the comments that we made last year as we wrapped up 2017. I think to the extent that people were surprised that volumes were down last year, we said, look, the issue simply this, public never showed up at the party. And I think what's happened this year's public is starting to make an appearance, but there's a much bigger appearance that they still have do make. And I think one of the things that's worth remembering on that is I did spend some time talking to those top 8 or 9 states, and what I'm trying to focus on as I was going through those was really what we see going on in the Colorado, and in Texas, and in Iowa, and the Maryland, and the Florida, and a Georgia, and South Carolina and North Carolina, all on public. And what we're seeing in those states over the last 18 to 24 months has been an effort to put much more consideration to that public sector. So I think, from where we're sitting, we think we should see a nice ramp up of that, and I don't think we're going to feel the negative from what's going on relative to the private either. I think, if we had a footprint that was not as Southeast and Southwest-driven, I feel modestly different about it. But again, so I'm looking at the footprint that we have from a private perspective, I feel really good. If I look at the footprint we have from a public perspective, I feel increasingly good.
Operator: And your next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS. Your line is open.
Craig Bibb: I am going to focus on price too. You had flat price and ready mix with volume up 15%, which seems like kind of gross, [ph] but now, it’s was because of a geographic mix change to lower priced markets and then market mix change away from energy. Putting through a price increase in October, so we're looking for flat price again in Q3 or what am I missing there?
Ward Nye: Yes. I guess, what we're saying is you just need to look and see where it is. If you're looking really looking at the ready mix business, what you want to look at from a Martin Marietta perspective, and you want to understand pricing is I want to encourage you to care about what's going on in Denver, and I would encourage you to care about what's going on in Dallas-Fort Worth. And then to the extent that you get gravy in that Southeast corner of Texas when there's energy activity, then that's really what it is. So if you're looking at pricing, and I say, look, it's up almost 6% in the Rockies, it's up 4% in that Northeast sector going out of the metroplex, and it's up 2.2% in Dallas, those really aren't disappointing numbers in my view, particularly if we're successful coming back in getting this price increase as we look at fall.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And then -- actually, the 2.2% in Dallas, I think that's where the bulk of your ready mix assets are?
Ward Nye: It is.
Craig Bibb: And that's a really strong market, so why only 2.2%?
Ward Nye: It's also -- you're right, it's a strong market, and it's a big market. And it's a market that has a lot of players, Craig.
Craig Bibb: So it's more price competitive then it's reasonable, given the strength of that?
Ward Nye: It's got a lot of players.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And then cement actually -- essentially that same question. I mean you guys have -- your pricing is kind of lagged with what you would've preferred for a little while now. And now the market's finally tight, and you're looking for $6 per ton in October. I'm sure you'd rather have $10 or $12, so what's holding it back?
Ward Nye: Well, we put on a $6 per ton price increase in October, and we're talking to our customers about it right now, Craig. So my intention is we'll come back and talk you all about that when we have our conversation in November. But we're just looking to see how the market accepts that.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And then last one on Magnesia Specialties, your margins were hit by kiln outage. Is that all behind you, and we return to normal margin or maybe a little better in the second half?
Ward Nye: No, I guess part of what I'm saying is 36.5% isn't a bad margin. So I'll take that every day. So maybe the primary things that you saw there is you saw some repairs in supply and contract services up about $2.2 million, about 12%. We had some planned and unplanned repairs to a rotary kiln and a silo and a clarifier. I think those issues are largely behind us. I think we anticipate a nice year for the rest of the year there. One thing that's worth noting is year-to-date capacity utilizations, steel is 76.3%, so that's up almost 3% from the 74.4% where it was in the prior year period. So again, as we look at the overall health of that business and the margins at 36.5%, there's just nothing to apologize for there. That's a very impressive performance.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Think you again for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're committed to driving shareholder value through the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, as we elevate Martin Marietta from an industry leader to a globally recognized world-class organization. We're executing on improvement plan that's successfully generating superior performance for investors, and we look forward to discussing our third quarter 2018 results with you in November. As always, we are available for any follow-ups. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President, Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A few administrative and clarifying items before we begin. All financial and operating results discussed today are for the first quarter 2018 and any comparisons are versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise noted. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website Q1 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends. As detailed on slide 6, we have enhanced our product line disclosures to distinguish between revenues and gross profit generated from products and services, and from freight arrangements. As a reminder, all margin references discussed today are based on revenues, and any non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q1 2018 supplemental information and SEC filings. As detailed on slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. We will begin today's teleconference with Ward Nye, who will discuss our first quarter operating performance and market trends, as well as the recently completed Bluegrass Materials acquisition. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and upwardly revised 2018 guidance. A question-and-answer session will follow these prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Importantly, as the quarter progressed, underlying customer demand remained strong and customer backlogs continued to grow as bidding activity increased, particularly in the West Group and, most notably, in Texas. Our Building Materials business saw strong shipment volumes on days not impacted by winter weather and improved pricing. Noteworthy as well, we once again posted record safety performance. With fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this point last year, our company's total injury incident rate now exceeds world-class benchmarks. With acceleration of construction activity through the balance of the year, together with favorable underlying demand trends, safe and efficient operations and continued price discipline, we remain on target to achieve our original 2018 guidance and, as announced in today's release, we're increasing that guidance to reflect the expected contribution from the Bluegrass acquisition. On April 27, we welcomed more than 400 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team, as we successfully completed the acquisition of Bluegrass, the largest privately-held pure-play aggregates business in the United States. With more than 2 billion tons of high-quality reserves, the acquired operations expand our product offerings and, importantly, strengthened our aggregates-led positions in high-growth regions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, principally in Georgia and Maryland. In these two states, aggregates shipments remain 20% to 30% below mid-cycle demand, not peak demand, but 20% to 30% below mid-cycle levels. As economic growth in the Eastern United States accelerates, we believe our enhanced geographic footprint positions us to meaningfully benefit from anticipated increased aggregates demand from construction activity. I'm grateful to our collective employees for their dedication and perseverance in reaching this point and their efforts to complete this acquisition, the second largest in our company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Bluegrass operations and realize synergies to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and employees. Thus far, integration activities have progressed superbly both from an operational and customer-facing perspective. We expect this trend to continue. Additionally, we appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice as it reviewed the Bluegrass transaction. We view the agreement reached with the DoJ as a fair, responsible and appropriate conclusion to the Hart-Scott-Rodino process. More specifically, the agreement requires that we divest the leasehold interest and related assets of our Forsyth County quarry, north of Atlanta, Georgia. We've already (5:38) the transaction. Additionally, we're required to divest Bluegrass's Beaver Creek quarry in Western Maryland. Our aim is to complete this sale in the second quarter. Such divestitures were anticipated and do not impact the strategic rationale for, or the value of, the Bluegrass transaction, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per diluted share and cash flow within 12 months. Now let's turn to the company's first quarter performance. In line with our first quarter business plan and normal seasonality, aggregates shipments decreased 8% overall, with all segments reporting declines from widespread precipitation and cold temperatures across our geographic footprint. That said, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, our single largest metropolitan market, eclipsed these more typical weather conditions, and in fact, experienced the wettest February on record with 10.5 inches of rainfall, or 8 inches above the normal level. This was punctuated by measurable snow accumulation that occurred in Houston and San Antonio, as well as in North Carolina. For example, our Mid-Atlantic Division, which historically has generated the company's highest margins, experienced three additional snow events compared with first quarter 2017, resulting in seven district-wide shutdowns. In addition, multiple nor'easters deferred shipments from our Nova Scotia operation into New York. Extreme temperature also impacts construction activity. In that regard, our Midwest Division experienced 15% fewer days with temperatures above freezing, which contributed to a double-digit volume decline. This is relevant because typically the ambient temperature needs to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit or higher for asphalt contractors to perform construction work on paving or patching projects. With respect to ready mixed concrete, if temperatures are too low, water and concrete mix can freeze, meaning it's not available to appropriately hydrate the cement bonding agent and potentially affect the strength of the concrete. Additionally, Class 1 railroad performance did not meet our expectations. Well-chronicled reports of inefficiencies, including longer load times, hindered quarterly shipment levels for both our Southeast and West Groups. Public construction is typically the most sensitive to weather conditions due to stringent Department of Transportation specifications regarding minimum temperatures and performance standards. We were not surprised to see aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market decrease 11%. The infrastructure market comprised 36% of first quarter aggregates volume, well below the company's most recent five-year average of 43%. We are encouraged, however, by what we view as a greater sense of customer urgency to advance projects. For example, our Charlotte District posted double-digit volume growth, as we shipped previously deferred tons for the Interstate 77 Express Lanes project scheduled to be completed by year-end. Looking ahead, we see strong underlying building activity in public works. Accordingly, we remain confident that infrastructure demand will improve as the construction season begins in earnest and the funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, and numerous state and local transportation initiatives translates into increased product demand. Aggregates shipments to the non-residential market decreased 10% overall, as weather challenges impacted office and retail construction activity. Notably, the Mideast Division reported strong heavy industrial growth, as the Mountaineer XPress Pipeline project in West Virginia finally broke ground in January, after obtaining long-awaited federal regulatory clearance. Continued project approvals, along with higher oil prices, bode well for increased aggregates consumption from the next wave of large energy sector projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. We expect these projects to continue to bid in 2018, with broader construction activity beginning in earnest in 2019 and beyond. Additionally, third-party forecasts support increased construction activity in both commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years. The non-residential market represented 31% of first quarter aggregates shipments. Aggregates shipments to the residential market, which tends to be the least weather-constrained end use, were flat for the quarter. We're seeing greater levels of single-family housing activity, which is more aggregates-intensive than multi-family activity in several of our key states. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, and South Carolina comprise 6 of the top 10 states for growth in single-family housing unit starts for the trailing 12-months ended March 2018. Inclusive of Indiana, Iowa, and now Maryland with the addition of Bluegrass, growth in single-family housing unit permits of almost 11% in our top nine states outpaces the national average. The outlook for residential construction remains robust, particularly in core Martin Marietta markets, driven by positive employment and population trends, land availability, and efficient permitting. Continued strength in residential construction should support future non-residential and infrastructure activity. The residential market accounted for 24% of first quarter aggregates shipments. To conclude our discussion on end use markets, aggregates shipments to the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 9% of first quarter shipments and declined 11%. Lower ballast volumes reflect weather constraints and the timing of purchases by East Coast railroads in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, agricultural lime shipments declined 8%, driven by the combination of cold and wet winter weather in the Midwest and the generally more challenging agricultural economy and outlook. A host of our annual price increases took effect in April. Nevertheless, aggregates price improved 2%. However, the combination of reduced rail commercial shipped volumes and product mix lowered the company's average selling price by $0.16 per ton. Importantly, in our predominantly truck-served Mid America Group, favorable product mix coupled with continued price discipline led to pricing growth of 5%. Geographic mix helped pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2%, as winter weather and railroad service issues limited our ability to move higher priced aggregates product by rail into our Georgia and Florida distribution yards. Product mix reduced long-haul shipments, and ongoing competitive dynamics in portions of Texas offset robust pricing growth in Colorado, resulting in a modest price increase for the West Group. Transient production constraints, compounded by February's abnormally heavy precipitation in Dallas-Fort Worth, resulted in a 9% decline in cement shipments. Additionally, our Midlothian plant had significantly more planned and unplanned downtime for repairs compared with the prior-year quarter. Encouragingly, the market dynamics remain favorable with what seems to be shaping into a year likely filled with a tight Texas cement supply. Shipment volumes on days not negatively impacted by weather and reinforced by robust bidding pipeline demonstrate market strength and resilience. For the quarter, cement pricing increased 4%. Turning to our downstream businesses, ready mixed concrete shipments decreased 2%, driven primarily by a more typical winter in the Rocky Mountains. Shipments for the Southwest Division were at planned levels for the quarter. Overall, price increased modestly for the quarter. Average selling prices in Colorado improved 4%. However, lower energy sector shipments, geographic mix, and other factors limited Texas ready mixed concrete pricing opportunities. In Colorado, lost production days related to the more normal winter weather were spread out, making it challenging for crews to gain operating efficiencies, contributing to the 31% decrease in asphalt shipments. Rising raw material costs allowed for favorable asphalt pricing during the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss first quarter financial results and the increases to our full-year 2018 guidance.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Ward. The Building Materials business posted total products and services revenues of $688 million, a 5% decrease, and gross profit of $85 million. Consistent with our first quarter internal plan, aggregates product gross margin was 12.5%. This 500-basis-point reduction reflects the operating leverage impact of lower shipment and production levels, higher DD&A and increased diesel costs. The temporary cement plant outages Ward mentioned earlier led to operating inefficiencies and lower sales, contributing to the 630-basis-point reduction in cement product gross margin, 26.6%. I'll note, we are now back in production at all kilns and selling every ton we can currently produce. Magnesia Specialties first quarter products and services revenues increased to a record $65 million. Lower contract services and maintenance costs, along with stable natural gas prices, contributed to a 230-basis-point expansion in product gross margin to 38.6%. Among other things, this business is benefiting from the increased demand for lithium-ion batteries. Our magnesium oxide products are sold to mines around the world to help them extract cobalt, which is a key input for those batteries. On a consolidated basis, we achieved earnings from operations of $39 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.16. We remain focused on allocating capital in a disciplined manner that reserves our financial flexibility. Capital expenditures inclusive of Bluegrass are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million for full-year 2018, as we continue to prudently invest in our business. In the first quarter, we returned $28 million to shareholders with a dividend of $0.44 per share. We returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. For the trailing 12 months ended March 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the applicable credit agreement, was 1.62 times. Pursuant to certain provisions of the credit agreement, the ratio excludes the $1.4 billion of debt issued in December to fund, in part, the Bluegrass acquisition. In April, we repaid $300 million of maturing bonds and amended our trade receivable facility to increase the facility size to $400 million. Following the Bluegrass acquisition, our current net debt level is $3.3 billion, with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3 times. We expect to return to our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times within 12 to 18 months. As detailed in today's release, we updated and increased our full-year 2018 guidance to reflect the expected contributions from the acquired Bluegrass operations. Absent Bluegrass, full-year 2018 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February 2018. For the remaining eight months of the year, we expect the Bluegrass operations to contribute approximately 13 million tons of aggregates shipment at an EBITDA margin of at least 50%. Accordingly, for 2018, we now expect consolidated total revenues to range from $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.15 billion to $1.27 billion, including realized synergies and excluding non-recurring transaction costs associated with the Bluegrass acquisition.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we believe the United States is in the midst of a steady and extended construction recovery, and we're well positioned to benefit from the anticipated increased demand. We expect construction activity to accelerate through the balance of the year nationally, with faster growth in our key geographies due to these regions' attractive market fundamentals. As a result, we expect 2018 to be a record year for Martin Marietta. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. The first is just a clarification on your fiscal 2018 guidance bridge. I know that you said you left the core or heritage guidance unchanged, but if you could help us understand the puts and takes of the Bluegrass contribution in addition to proceeds from asset sales and synergies? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Kathryn. Thanks for your question. You're exactly right. The heritage guidance remains exactly the same. Let me give you a sense of how to factor in Bluegrass. If we look at our guidance with Bluegrass in, let's look at shipments first, we expect shipments to range up from 12% to 14%. So, as we said in the prepared remarks, Bluegrass adds, for this year, about 13 million tons. Now let me be clear on that. Bluegrass last year did about 17.5 million, so again, that 13 million tons that we're talking about is only for eight months of this year. We expect the ASP, when you look at Bluegrass and Martin Marietta together, to range from up 2% to up 4%. Now, remember, heritage is actually up 3% to 5%. So we are reaffirming that heritage aggregates increase. The reason that we're taking the overall from 3% to 5% to 2% to 4% is the Bluegrass average selling price of $12.32 a ton is 10% to 15% below our corporate average. So we're simply averaging that out. Kathryn, if you look at SG&A, there is no change to our original guidance. If you look at interest expense, that's up about $10 million. That simply reflects the incremental borrowing on the $1.4 billion bond deal that Jim referenced in his opening comments. So, if we look at an adjusted EBITDA, it's been revised upward in the range of $80 million. So, to the part and essence of your question, Bluegrass itself is going to add about $86 million to that, plus what we believe will be realized synergies in this calendar year of about $7.5 million. Remember, we had said we will get operating synergies of $15 million, but we said we'd get that in the full 12 months. So we think, in this calendar year, 2018, we'll get about $7.5 million of that. Now, to your point, we do have a divestiture impact. So, as I commented in my opening comments, we have already sold the operation in Forsyth County, Georgia. We're in the process now of going through a sale for the Beaver Creek quarry in Maryland. We believe the divestiture impact is going to be about $8 million a year. And one thing I think is important for me to say in this regard, as we look at the divestitures that were required, candidly we came into the transaction and knew there might be a couple of quarries that would be divested in this transaction. That's exactly what we have seen as we've gone through the process. We certainly value the Forsyth quarry that we had to sell, but for what it's worth the Cumming quarry that we've now picked up among others in North Georgia is about 3.5 times more profitable than Forsyth one's. So, again, as we look at the divestitures and look at the overall transaction, it makes all of the financial and strategic sense that we thought it made before. And as a reminder, EBITDA margins in this business should be 50%-plus. And the other thing that I'll specifically draw your attention to is there's not a change in the CapEx guidance. So, one of the questions that we got, Kathryn, it might have been from you when we announced this transaction, is how much did we see this deal changing the rhythm and cadence of our CapEx. Our comments at the time was this was a well-run, well-maintained business, thus no change in the CapEx guidance. So I hope that commentary helps you fill that bridge out, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: It does. And could you give just a – appreciate your comment on having already sold Forsyth, but could you give maybe a little bit more color on the two assets, one that is due to be sold in Maryland, and also maybe compare and contrast Forsyth versus the Cumming quarry you just mentioned?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, as I said, Cumming is going to sell probably about 3X the volume and more than 3X in EBITDA profitability. It's simply a larger quarry and a bit farther out insofar as there's actually development that's going on around it. So, from our perspective, we like both Forsyth and we like Cumming, but we're very happy to have the Cumming quarry going forward. And if you're looking at Beaver Creek quarry all by itself, it's a relatively small quarry. It's close to our Boonsboro operation, thus the required divestiture. That's a quarry that's looking about 300,000 tons on a per annum basis. So it's not significant tonnage at all in the grand scheme of things, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. And then, finally, just in terms of the cadence in the Q2. We're mostly the way through Q1 earnings. We've had a lot of different feedback from a wide variety of different construction-related contracts. And April's gotten off to a better start. But with that in mind, just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of cadence of how things look into Q2. But, importantly, if you just look at bid activity relative to last year, if you could give any comment on bid activity beyond just pure volumes. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Absolutely, Kathryn. There are a couple of things. If we look at the change in average daily tons in the quarter, it was actually remarkably predictable, which is one reason that we feel as confident as we are. We're sitting almost precisely where we thought we would be. So, if you go back to the guidance that we gave in February, we said we thought Q1 would be more normal and that's what we were anticipating for the balance of the year. So, if we look at what January shipments look like relative to changes in average daily tons, January was down 7%. If we look in February, and again this ties to the commentary that I gave that, number one, it was normal almost everywhere except in Texas, it was the heaviest rain month in record-keeping history for February. Shipments were down 14%. Then we go into March and suddenly shipments were up 2% over, as you recall, last year was not a March that anyone would have been ashamed of. So we like the rhythm and cadence of what we see. It's always been our custom and practice not to talk specifically about months in the next quarter. I know others have done that. I will tell you that the general view of, if the weather is clear, shipping is good, is certainly a mantra that we do not disagree with. So I'll leave it at that and I hope that that's responsive to your question.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you, again.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Encouraged to see things pick up in March and April. Curious to get your thoughts from a DOT standpoint, have you seen any catch-up on their end from a funding level and any key markets you're seeing that FAST Act money started to kick in? And just lastly, on that note, can you give us an update on public spending, how you're thinking about the outlook for this year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, absolutely. And, Phil, that actually ties into a piece of Kathryn's question that I inadvertently left out. We are seeing federal and public work pick up, and we're seeing that pickup in states that are actually pretty important to Martin Marietta. So, if we're looking at letting activity right now in Texas and we're looking at letting activity importantly in North Carolina, it's looking as attractive as I've seen for a while. Our DOT Secretary here in North Carolina started the year last year with about $2.3 billion worth of money he needed to get into the system and needed to get it there quickly. As he came into the year, he had about $1.6 billion left of that by end of the fiscal year, which for him is in September, and anticipates having only $1 billion of that left. From where we sit, that is very attractive news. The other thing that I'll say is the gas price increases that we have seen in states like South Carolina and Indiana, have also picked up work in those states. So, if we're looking at states that matter disproportionately to Martin Marietta, our largest state by revenue is Texas and that letting schedule is going to go from $6.2 billion last year to about $7.9 billion this year. Keep in mind, we're going to see more Prop 1 money this year than we've seen for a while because of oil activity, and we're also going to see that Prop 7 money starting to come in. So, Texas, from a public perspective, has a very attractive outlook. Colorado is going to have an attractive outlook as well. One shift there, we're seeing fewer jobs, but larger jobs. And we like the larger, more complicated jobs because suddenly the certainty of supply becomes critical on those jobs, so we like what we're seeing in Colorado. North Carolina is next, we've talked about that. Next would be Georgia and Florida. Again, Florida's got a near-record DOT budget this year. The other thing that I would say relative to what we're seeing in Florida is we're seeing very nice activity relative to Interstate 4 and what they call, I-4 Beyond the Ultimate. So, this year, Florida DOT is sitting on about a $10 billion DOT budget, which is modestly off a record budget from last year. So, again, as we rack up the states that are most important to North Carolina on the public piece of it, it's lining up again the way that we thought it would. Remember, we finished last year with less than 40% of our volume going to public. That was a record low. We do not expect that to be replicated this year. The other piece, Phil, that I would say is when you're looking at DOT work, something to keep in mind is that tends to be, as we said in our prepared remarks, the higher specification product that tends to come with a higher average selling price, as does stone that's going to residential. So the more we see single-family residential continuing to move in positive ways, particularly in the Carolinas, Georgia, Colorado and the like, that will be helpful, not just on volumes going out the door, it'll be helpful on ASPs as well. I hope that's helpful to you, Phil.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: No, that's really helpful. And I appreciate the color on the Carolinas because, if I remember correctly, that was a market you said that needed to be strong to kind of give you confidence to hit your numbers. So it sounds like things are shaping up nicely there. And then, on pricing, a competitor of yours talked about planning to implement a mid-year price increase on the aggregates side of things. Just curious to get your thoughts. Is that an opportunity for you? And if that's the case, what kind of percentage of your business would benefit from that dynamic?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. We'll certainly come back and look at mid-year price increases as we get closer to that point in time. Keep in mind, as I said in our prepared remarks, we did have a host of price increases that went into effect in April. I think, really, watching to see how tight some of these markets are as we get closer to mid-year is going to be the driver on some of that. Look, I think Colorado may well be a tight market this year. I think portions of the Southeast may see some tight markets this year, again, in many respects, because those markets have been so far off of midpoint for a while that producers in some respects may have to hustle to put more stone on the ground. One area in particular, I'm going to shift on you just a bit, Phil, and talk about Texas and cement. I do think this is likely to be a year that cement is going to be tight in Texas. We'll have to see what that means relative to a host of other activity in that state and relative to cement pricing itself. But I do think you're going to see some good, steady spots of tightness this year. I think that will certainly lead us to be reflective on mid-year price increases, and we will talk more about that during our next call.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Got it. And just a final question on cement. Margins obviously came down. Part of that is just the operating leverage of that business. But just wanted some color from an inflation standpoint. Are you seeing any noticeable headwinds that maybe we need to be mindful going forward? And how are you going to offset that with pricing? Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We're not seeing notable inflation that's really affecting that business. As I said in our commentary, the biggest issue that we had in the quarter is February was wet, and we had a longer outage this year than we have in the past. We actually had a clinker cooler project that was underway that does several things for us. It lets us lower maintenance costs going forward and lets us lower energy costs going forward. So we were clearly down longer in Q1, so a lot of what you were seeing is just a lack of operating leverage, as opposed to any other significant inflation factors that are in that business. Again, we think this is going to be a pretty attractive cement volume year in Texas, and we think and believe it will be tight. And actually the fly ash shortages that we've seen in Texas, while we think those will abate to a degree as we go into the year, will certainly not be fully abated and I think continue to help our volumes in cement.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Thanks a lot, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Seiden with Barclays.
Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just I guess, first – also thank you for the helpful slide that you guys had that showed aggregates demand across the cycle. So I was just wondering if you could comment particularly on some of the largest states, how that would have compared, I guess, with last year versus your expectations, particularly around Texas, Colorado, and North Carolina? And then I guess, more importantly, what are some of the bottlenecks that could potentially come up that prevent seeing some of those mid-cycle or some of those higher-cycle volumes from being recognized?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Adam, thanks for your question. I'll try to take it in order of revenue. Look, Texas, from a cycle perspective, has hit a pretty sustainable level I think right now. I think Texas clearly has growth potential ahead of it. I don't doubt that. But as I look at, at least, where they were relative to history, the cycle is relatively healthy in Texas, because at least it's above a mid-cycle state. But if we go back to what mid-cycle looked like and we go back to what population looked like in Texas when they were at mid-cycle, those continue to be the drivers that make me have a great deal of confidence in the way that marketplace is going to look, not just now but for the next several years. If you look at what PCA is saying relative to growth in Texas, not just this year but for the next two and three years, PCA is projecting nice, steady cement growth in that marketplace. Now, Colorado has been a spectacular market for us. And Colorado has been a spectacular market for us at volumes that are still below mid-cycle in a state that is watching depletion hit reserve deposits pretty significantly. Now, keep in mind, we are exceptionally well-positioned, I would submit positioned better than anyone else in the sector to make sure we can continue to serve that marketplace through long-haul transportations, specifically coming in from Wyoming into that Northern Denver marketplace. Population trends in Colorado continue to be very, very strong. And one of the things that we've mentioned in the past is, oddly enough, aggregate pricing in that state is still considerably below our corporate average. So part of what we've indicated is, given depletion scenarios and the fact that you're seeing high population growth in that state, residential continues to be very good. We believe public is going to be good. We think that's still a state that has a nice way forward. As you look at other states that are important to us, and looking at the slide that you referenced, on slide 12, looking at North Carolina and Georgia, I mean, those are states that from a gross profit perspective are disproportionately important to us. And, obviously, Georgia is becoming even more important with the acquisition of Bluegrass. We like what we're seeing in both of those states, and we like the profitability of both of those states, despite the fact that we're 20% below mid-cycle. So again, if you look at what population trends are doing in North Carolina and Georgia and what projections are over the near-term, medium-term and long-term, we're very excited about our positions in both of those states and we're delighted with the increased presence that we have, particularly in Atlanta today. Again, if we go back to some of the other core states that we have, Iowa, one of the single most stable states that we have in our footprint and the chart certainly reveals that. South Carolina, with what they've done on their gas tax, certainly in a position to continue to grow what they're doing, but they are at mid-cycle. But, again, looking at places like Florida, Maryland, and Indiana and where they are relative to mid-cycle, but what they are all doing with respect to public works, we feel like those are very attractive states for us and the population rank, fiscal health and the type of footprint we have in those states will be our friend in the near-, medium-, and long-term, Adam.
Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then also you spoke about this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but around logistics, which have been constrained quite a bit. You've seen rail (36:36) starts in Texas step up, particularly I guess more so in Houston than the Dallas area. And you also talked a little bit about it in Georgia. So wondering if there's a line of sight to seeing some of these logistical issues clearing up today, or potentially we're in the same spot? And how that could impact or what type of measures you guys can put in place to get around some of those?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Look, that's a perfectly fair question and a good one. We did see a Q1 impact from what was happening, or more to the point, what was not happening relative to rail. So if we're looking at the Southeast Group, it cost us about 340,000 tons. If we're looking at the West Group, it cost us around 300,000 tons. And the performance issues that we saw were increased delays in trains, increase in cars held, and longer load times. I mean, those were the three primary drivers. Now part of what happened too is, on March 16, the Surface Transportation Board requested the Class 1 railroads to give them an outlook on how they were going to address some of these issues. And actually, if you look at what those responses entail, BNSF said that they expected to hire around 2,000 employees company-wide in 2018. UP is looking at a very similar number. Norfolk Southern actually hired 1,100 people last year. They're looking to hire, we believe, around 1,400 more in 2018. Here's the quick answer to your question. It's already better than it was in Q1. So, is it getting better? Yes. Is it getting measurably better? Yes. Do we feel like because of the sheer quantum of material that we move by rail that we're going to be better positioned than most to work with the railroads to make sure this is minimized and perhaps back at status quo in several months? We certainly hope so. And again, the progress that we have seen to-date in working with every one of the railroads has been notable and we're very grateful for their efforts in that regard.
Adam Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate that. Thanks, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You bet, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Ward, Jim, Suzanne. I'm wondering if you could talk about the guidance revision, so the EBITDA raise of $80 million, sales raise of $140 million, so that implies 56% incremental margin. Is that the true margin profile of Bluegrass? I'm assuming there are other moving pieces in there, but maybe you could flesh that out for us.
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Jerry, it's Jim. So there are other moving pieces in there. I mean, that's directionally correct. Ward kind of walked through the bridge. So there are some puts and takes with divestitures and those kinds of things in there, but directionally you're pretty close to it.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good. In terms of so, Jim, just to be clear, the EBITDA margin profile of the Bluegrass business is over 50%?
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yes.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. And then, as you folks had mentioned, this is the largest deal the company has undertaken. Can you talk about, as you're getting to know the operations and the operators, are there any opportunities for what you folks are seeing on the Bluegrass side to implement similar practices on the Martin Marietta side? Anything that you folks are seeing as an opportunity as you get to know the operations better post close?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Jerry, thanks for the question. I guess, a couple of things. Number one, it's the second largest we've ever done. So, TXI still has the ribbon or being the largest. So this is the second largest. Obviously, we closed on this last Friday. What I will tell you is the integration process has gone exceptionally well. Part of what you've heard us saying the past year is, when we're integrating a stone business, if we can close on a Friday, by Monday morning when trucks go over our scales, they should see a Martin Marietta sign out front. They should be getting a Martin Marietta ticket. Our employees will have been trained and that business will in large part have been integrated, and that's exactly where we are. Here's what we're seeing. We have brought on an incredibly talented group of employees. We're delighted to have them. From what we can tell, they're delighted to be here. There will clearly be efficiencies that will come from this transaction both in Bluegrass legacy and in heritage Martin Marietta. One of the things that we try to make sure that we don't do is going to a transaction with what has historically been called the arrogance of the acquirer. So, if we find things that we feel like they're doing that are better than what we have been doing historically in Martin Marietta, we will absolutely positively adopt it, and likewise in the other direction. Part of what I like about this transaction is we have integration activities going on in three different divisions of Martin Marietta at the same time. So we have the Mideast Division, we have the Mid-Atlantic Division and the Southeast Division, all going through a process of integration. The reason that I like that is we get a great cross-section of communication and exposure to these operations. So we have very experienced division presence who are overseeing each one of those divisions, all the districts involved, and again, we like the talent very much. So we sit here today actually more enthusiastic about what was already a very enthusiastically received transaction today than we felt about it nine months ago when we announced it, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And the rail service issues, lots of folks across a number of industries are seeing constraints come up. I'm wondering if you can talk about it, if you see an opportunity to realize better pricing as a result of supply constraints, as we get through the course of 2018. And if so, if you could highlight the regions where you think that might be possible, if you're willing to opine.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. There can certainly be some areas if you end up with varying degrees of tightness because of that, that you could see that opportunity. If you look at the way our long-haul business works, Jerry, it's a practical matter. There's going to be some long-haul in some parts of the company, principally in the Midwest, that's going to be more ballast-oriented as opposed to commercial stone-oriented. So, if you're looking at the markets that could potentially be impacted by what you're speaking of, could it be portions of South Texas? Yeah, it actually could be. Could it be portions of South Georgia? Yes. Could it be portions of Florida? The answer to that question is yes as well. But, again, we'll have to see how that plays out during the course of the year. But keep in mind, I have said that there will be parts of the country today that may experience varying degrees of stone shortages in different sizes, and those will certainly be factors that will be calculated into what could potentially happen with pricing, supply and demand in different markets.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much, and congratulations on closing the second biggest acquisition and thank you for the correction on this one.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Nicely noted. Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Timna.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Wanted to ask if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments about uses of cash. Under what circumstances do you think about returning to buybacks? And if you could talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline as you see it? I know you just did a big transaction as you said, but seems pretty achievable to get to your debt metric targets within a pretty short period of time. So, just wanted to get your latest thoughts on cash use.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Timna, well, first of all, thank you for your question. Secondly, if we look at what our debt to EBITDA ratio is, Jim gave you, in his prepared remarks, where it was at the end of the quarter. Obviously, at some point shortly after that, we closed on a large transaction, as you noted. Our debt to EBITDA ratio now is about 3 times. If we look at where we think that's going to be by the end of the year, we think it's going to be down to about 2.5 times. Part of what you've heard us say through a cycle, Timna, is we'd like to be in that range of 2 to 2.5 times as we go through a cycle. So what I'm taken by is you do the second largest transaction in the company's history at $1.625 billion and, literally, within eight months, through the cash generation and others that's being thrown off of that business, we're back into a targeted debt to EBITDA ratio. What I would say to you is this, if you look at what our capital priorities are, they haven't changed. Our capital priorities are what's the right transaction. And we think doing the right transaction is the most value-accretive thing that we can do for our shareholders, not any transaction, the right transaction. We're also sensitive to making sure that we're investing in the business prudently. So, part of what we're doing this year is investing nearly $0.5 billion in CapEx into our business. Again, that number has not changed from what we came into the year saying. Now, one thing I will note, Timna, is we can pull back on that CapEx if we need to. So we think we're investing prudently. And the next is making sure that we're returning cash to shareholders. And that's through two things, a sustainable dividend and buying shares back. Keep in mind, I think we might have been one of the only companies in our space, if not the only company, who through the downturn never cut its dividend. And what you've seen us do the last couple of years is very steadily take that dividend up. Again, that's a board decision. Our board will be looking at that again in August. So, from capital spent and other perspective and what our policies are, they have not changed in your views on how quickly the business de-levers is exactly right.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Yeah. I was looking for a little bit more, if you wouldn't mind, on the M&A pipeline and how you think about it, given your comments that we're kind of in the middle of the cycle. If, you've said in the past, we were in earlier innings, if we're in mid-innings, does this mean that you're more or less apt to do acquisitions, as last cycle you were pretty good about not timing any big ones at the top of the cycle?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I guess what I would say, Timna, is I do expect there would be more transactions. If you think back to what we've said last year, we had said last year that we felt like it would be a year of fairly large transactions, and it was. My sense is that's not what you'll see this year. And I think you're going to see something that's more of a traditional year where you're likely to see more bolt-on acquisitions in smaller, more discrete markets. That's what I would expect to see this year and, candidly, that's what I might expect to see even through a good portion of next year. So, if I'm sitting here just measuring the way that I'm looking at it, there's certainly a good number of conversations that are underway right now. So, owners of businesses and others are certainly interested in dialogues. At the same time, we intend to be thoughtful and measured and appropriate in the transactions that we look at. But, again, I'm not seeing large transactions in the immediate future.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. Thank you. That's helpful. And if you wouldn't mind, last question on the Magnesia Specialties segment. My interest was piqued by your comments on the contribution to cobalt mining. And then I know in the past you've said that the steel tariffs are actually a net positive.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is this a segment that you think about growing? It seems like those are pretty – at least buzzword-wise, those are exciting opportunities. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the outlook there?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: They are exciting opportunities. And part of what it's allowed us to do is continue to look at higher margin portions of that business for us. If you think about what that business is, it's really two very different things that come together to form that business, Timna. You've got a dolomitic lime operation in Woodville, Ohio and you've got a chemical plant in Manistee, Michigan that's making a product that has the capacity to serve industrial uses in the United States, but also has a capacity to serve that on a worldwide basis. One of the biggest issues that business has is one of capacity, and we will continue to look at that to see if we can find ways to grow that business. But I will tell you, part of what we referenced a little while ago on one of the questions is how steady our Midwest business has been all the way through cycles. This business, too, has been remarkably steady through cycles. So we look at this business a little bit like you do the Hippocratic Oath, and that is, first, do no harm. This is a tremendous business that has margins that we and that management team are very proud of. And to the extent that we can grow it, not only would we like to, we've got a management team there that certainly has the capacity to do it. So, that's my quick take on that, Timna. That may not give you all the granularity that you wish, but I'm probably not going to give you that today, anyway.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you, anyway. Thanks a lot.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about Maryland and what you're seeing there. Obviously, it appears to have geographical constraints, so maybe a limited number of competitors, which should bode well for pricing. I'm curious if you can talk about the environment there from a demands perspective. How you're thinking about the private and public trends in the state there now that you've added Bluegrass?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, absolutely. Look, we're very proud of having now a leading position in Maryland. If you think about what we said for a while, Scott, if we go back over the last eight years of our business, in 2010 when we rolled out our first version of SOAR, our Strategic Operating Analysis and Review, our long-term strategic plan, we had a one or two position in 65% of our markets in at least the way that we characterize them. Today, we have a one or two position in 90% of our markets, and one of the areas in which we did not have that one or two position was Maryland. And this transaction clearly changes that. Several things that I would say. Number one, any state that borders the Chesapeake Bay is always going to have relatively high barriers to entry, because you're going to have a pretty sensitive environmental community that's there. You also have a large community that simply lives there and you have a large community who needs to move around that state and come into either D.C. or farther up into the Northeast Megaregion. From our perspective, Governor Hogan's proposal of $9 billion worth of P3 projects in interstate expansion in the Baltimore-Washington corridor are the types of projects that we anticipated as we went into Bluegrass. So, as we look at the business, several things. One, we think Maryland is an attractive state, period. Number two, we think Maryland's going to be a particularly attractive state on the public side of it, and we think it's going to be that way for a while. And we think using both P3 and traditional funding will continue to make that very attractive. So, from where we're sitting, Maryland now being the number one state for us, and really one of our big nine states, we're very happy with that. And you'll recall, too, from that earlier slide when we were looking at where states are relative to the midpoint of the cycle, Maryland continues to be, let's call it, 30% below or 20%-plus below on mid-cycle demand. So we feel like we've acquired a good business in good areas at the right time. But that gives you some color around Maryland that I hope is helpful.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. And I'm curious with those comments in mind, and then of course there's the Georgia operations, and back to the already high incremental margins and 50% EBITDA margins that you expect from the business. So Bluegrass is currently, it's 10% to 15% below the corporate average from pricing. I realize some of that's going to be geographics, difference in long-haul and such. But because of the dynamics you just explained from Maryland, do you see the opportunity to accelerate pricing in these markets where we start to see this going from a 50% EBITDA margin business to, I don't know, throw something out there, 55% or potentially even higher over the next couple of years?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Again, I hate to speak to very specific regions on what we think will or won't happen to pricing. I mean, as you know, typically high barriers to entry, which Maryland has, and good population growth, which Maryland has, and depleting reserves, which I think Maryland will be faced with, creates its own form of an economic environment. And I think we have a leading position in that type of an evolving economic environment. And I'll leave it up to you to sort out how you want to model that.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And one more for me. On the competitive dynamics in Texas that I believe were mentioned in the pricing, I'm curious, given such strong underlying fundamentals, do you see a path to a better trajectory in Texas? Or will we continue to see some of these competitive dynamics in place, even as demand and shipments ramp up?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It's going to be interesting, because if we look at what pricing on the aggregates side has done in Texas over the last several years, pricing in that state has actually moved upwardly in aggregates in a fashion that clearly has exceeded the corporate average. As I indicated before, I think this will actually be a year where cement may end up being tight in that state. It'll be curious to see how that goes through the overall marketplace there. Again, with the market position that we have in attractive places like Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio and Houston, where population demographics, infrastructure spend, and non-res and res continues to be very strong, I think you've got a circumstance where you're still dealing with a marketplace that's selling stone for around 75% of our corporate average. Particularly in Dallas-Fort Worth, I want to make sure we're getting good value for our product, because we do have a diminishing resource in that marketplace, and making sure that we're being responsive and responsible relative to pricing that's going to be important for us. Again, as I look at historically over the last several years, I like what I've seen. If I look at what I think could be market tightness on cement, we'll see how that plays out during the course of the year.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Ward. I appreciate all the color on these questions. Good luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you. You take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Ward, thanks for the very helpful comments about average daily volume, ag volume in Q1. At present, when weather is good, average daily volume is running up about how much?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Craig, again, what I try not to do is go into months outside the quarter, because if you ever do that and then you don't do it, people will read things into it that at times are accurate or oftentimes aren't. So what I'm trying to do is just stick to the quarter. I'll tell you about the next one when it rolls around. But I did try to give you as much of a drive-by as I could by saying, look, when the weather is good, the shipments are good. And you can look at what the forecast has been and probably come up with a snapshot of how it's been. But it's a beautiful day in North Carolina.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, this year kind of hinges on infrastructure coming back. You're off to a weak start due to weather in the first quarter. Can you talk about internal metrics, like backlog, et cetera, that give you confidence for the remainder of the year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. We forecast and reforecast about every month. And we have good conversations, not just with our teams that are on the ground in these different quarries or districts or divisions, but also with our customers. We have one of our largest customer events in April. And our division presidents and I spend several days with our largest customers there and visit with them. I can tell you from their perspective on what their backlogs look like, I think they're feeling like they have the richest backlogs that they've had in a long time. I think they have a high degree of confidence and optimism in the year. And from our perspective, when our customers are feeling good, that certainly improves our outlook. And number two, when we're hearing and seeing from the different DOTs the types of dialogue and numbers that we're seeing, and again, in particular some of the DOTs that are most important to us, TxDOT and NCDOT, when we have customers that are as confident as our customers are and we have DOTs that are being as aggressive as I see some of these states being in getting work out, that's a very attractive spot for us. And again, if we look at what infrastructure's been for the last several years, it has been way off of what historically we would have seen. And keep in mind, given the FAST Act dollars are there, and I believe we're starting to see those coming through, and we have amped up state programs and we have amped up local programs, I think that trifecta holds great promise for us this year.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, with some of that, it always seems like it's on the cusp of getting tight and maybe seeing some price acceleration, and then there's a change in the competitive dynamic, whether it's imports or competitors trying to take share. What's going to change that dynamic now that we could actually have tight capacity and see it come through in price?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, really what we've been talking more about today than anything else is what's going on relative to supply in that marketplace. And I think, several things. One, did fly ash being back into a bit of a corner make cement a bit tighter in Texas? It has. Does housing staying strong in that market make cement tighter? It does. Does TxDOT ramping up their budget over $1 billion, or their letting program, make it a bit tighter? It does. So I think there are a host of reasons that we believe Texas cement is going to be pretty healthy this year. I mean, as we look at it right now, that North Texas market, frankly, is just sold out. And, we mentioned in one of the earlier calls, we've opened a new terminal in South Texas at New Caney. So we have some different outlets this year, as opposed to outlets we've had in years past. So we think, as we look at sheer volumes this year both in the north, central and, to a degree, in the south, it's just a more attractive year.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. Two-thirds of your pre-tax income in the quarter was other income. What was that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: If we're looking at the other income, I think you're probably looking at about $8.5 million.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Right.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: About $5 million of that was interest on the income or the $1.4 billion worth of borrowing, and that's the biggest piece of it. The other was just income on equity investments.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, it looked like that was left in your adjusted EBITDA number. I didn't see it in the add-backs. So...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Craig, we'll just have to go back and take that offline. I'm not sure.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Anyway, yeah, again, thanks a lot.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Hey. This is Jeff Stevenson in for Garick. I had a question on the geographic mix impact for aggregates pricing, and just wondered how you expect that evolve over the rest of the year and into 2019?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. No, look, I appreciate the question. A couple of things. I'll look at the mix impact both relative to product and geographic, and look at it through those two lenses and then try to fuse them together for you. If we look at what the product impact was, and the product impact probably had about a 30 bps adjustment, and geographic impact probably about 80 bps. And both of those were headwinds as opposed to tailwinds. So, cumulatively, about 110 basis points of headwind relative to pricing, which really gives you about a $0.16 per ton headwind. So, if we look at what the ASP growth would have been, assuming the same mix that we had in the prior year, it would have been about 3.4%, again, ahead of a host of April 1 price increases. And that 3.6%, even early on in the year would have had us within, albeit on the low end, but within the range of what we thought pricing would be for the full year. So, when we look at it through that lens, we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've put out.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Okay. Great. And I just had a quick question on Georgia. Last year, the DOT had some delays in getting projects out the door. And just wondering if you had any additional color on kind of what you're seeing? Are more projects being let out? And any increase in what you're seeing in the market?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We feel like the Georgia market this year is going to be healthy on both private and public. Remember, one of the issues that Georgia was faced with a couple of years ago is they went through what's referred to as House Bill 170, where they effectively doubled their DOT budget, adding an incremental $900 million to that. That was actually two years ago. And if you look at the rhythm and cadence of spend, even on the FAST Act, that type of 18, 24 months, sometimes a little bit longer trail time, is not unusual in seeing those dollars get more into the system. So, again, we feel like Georgia, both public and private, will be very attractive this year. And we think our new augmented position, particularly in North Georgia, is going to be well situated to benefit from that.
Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our hosts.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, again, for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Guided by a commitment to our core values and disciplined execution of our strategic plan, we remain focused on elevating Martin Marietta from an aggregates industry leader to a globally recognized world-class organization, allowing us to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results with you in July. Until then, we thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jonathan, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President-Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, as we have done in the past, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. As detailed on slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC Web site. As a reminder, all margin references in today’s teleconference are based on total revenues. Any non-GAAP measures discussed today are explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our Web site and in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today’s teleconference. As announced in this morning’s release, 2017 was a record setting year for Martin Marietta. For the first time, we generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA of over $1 billion. Notably, this achievement coincided with the best safety performance in our company’s history. In addition to these milestones, we establish records for revenues, profitability and earnings per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record performance, which was achieved without aggregates volume growth, validates the steadfast commitment to our core values and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Our financial performance starts with operating our facilities safely. I’m proud to report that we surpassed world-class loss time instant rate levels company-wide. Further, half of our divisions exceeded world-class total entry instant rates, a remarkable safety performance is rewarding in its own right. That said, elevated safety awareness across the company has also reduced downtime from workplace incidence leading to higher revenues and profitability. For the full year 2017, we delivered the following record consolidated results. Revenues of $4 billion, EBITDA of over $1 billion, gross profit of $972 million, earnings from operations of $700 million and earnings per diluted share of $11.25, which includes a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $4.07 per diluted share from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for 2017 or 2017 Tax Act. Importantly, we achieved full year record earnings per diluted share of $7.18, excluding this one-time benefit, an increase to $0.55 compared with 2016. Geographic positioning, price leadership, prudent cost discipline and reinvestment in our business through appropriate capital allocation contributed to these record results. Our performance is all the more noteworthy given the externally driven volume headwinds that limited shipping and production volumes through much of the year. Coming into 2017, we fully anticipated accelerated growth in aggregates volumes, particularly in the public arena, given the anticipated benefits from the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act together with various states and local initiatives. Our peers, along the third-party forecasters, also unequivocally echo this sentiment. Indeed Martin Marietta benefited from positive momentum in private residential and non-residential construction. However, infrastructure activity proved disappointing for us, the industry as a whole and the nation; contrary to third-party forecasts, highways and streets construction spending decreased 4% nationally in 2017 as near record precipitation, government uncertainty, labor constraints and slower than anticipated pace of public contract lettings exerted downward pressure on highway construction activity. As a result, the company’s full year aggregate shipments decreased 1 million tons compared with 2016, almost 9 million tons lower than our initial 2017 guidance. This shortfall, in both actual and forecasted volumes, makes our financial performance all the more noteworthy. That said, the need to address our nation’s hired infrastructure did not go away. America’s highways, bridges, roads and streets only got a year older in 2017, and are still largely in desperate need of repairs and to our expansion. These projects will get done some in 2018 or more likely over the next several years. Thus, from a suppliers’ perspective, we’ll like be busy for the foreseeable future. For the year, our building materials business, which includes aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations, posted record revenues of $3.7 billion, a 4% increase. Pricing improved across all product lines and segments as the business continues to benefit from strong underlying market fundamentals. Full year aggregates product line pricing improved 4.5% despite lower shipment volumes. The Southeast and Mid-America Groups generated increases of 9% and 5% respectively, driven by continued price leadership. Product mix and ongoing competitive pressures led to a 2% price improvement for the West Group as several large energy projects requiring higher price materials were completed in 2016 and did not renew in 2017. Cement pricing improved 4% for the year, reflecting robust construction activity in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Ready mixed concrete and asphalt average selling prices increased 3% and 11%, respectively. Strong demand in Colorado allowed for favorable asphalt pricing throughout the year. Shipment levels for the building materials business vary across both product lines and geographies. First, let’s take a look at the aggregates product line. Full year shipments declined 1% overall with both the Mid-America and West Group’s reporting decreased volumes. The Southeast Group generated volume growth of 5% despite the previously discussed headwinds, demonstrating the underlying strength of construction demand into Florida and Georgia markets. Overall, full year aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market decreased 2%, reflecting continued under-investment in the nation’s infrastructure coupled with marginal construction activity from the FAST Act and project delays. As a result, the infrastructure market comprised only 40% of full year aggregates volumes. Below the company’s most recent five year average of 43% and 10 year average of 48%. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by positive fourth quarter infrastructure trends in Colorado, Georgia and portions of North Carolina and Texas. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market decreased 4% for the year, while the Southeast Group reported strong heavy industrial construction growth. The West Group consistent with management’s expectations reported a double-digit decline in non-residential shipments due to the completion of several large industry related projects in Texas in 2016 that were not immediately replaced in 2017. The non-residential market represented 31% of full year aggregate shipments. Continued strength in housing across the company’s geographic footprint, particularly in the Western and Southeastern United States led to 12% increase in full year aggregate shipments to the residential market. Notably Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Colorado key geographies for the building materials business comprised six of the top 10 states for growth in single family housing unit starts for the 12 months ended December 2017. The residential market accounted for 21% of full year aggregates product line shipments. To conclude our discussions on end use markets, aggregate volumes for the ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 8% of the full year shipments and declined 10% versus 2017, driven by reduced balanced and agricultural line shipments. We view cement as the valuable product, particularly in the Dallas, Fort Worth area given its attractive underlying market fundamentals. As such, in 2017, we accepted temporary volume reductions to support our long-term cement strategy of value before volume. To that effect, full year cement shipments declined 2%, while cement pricing increased nearly 4%. Notably, fourth quarter cement volumes improved 2% reflecting the company’s disciplined approach to recapturing market share temporarily lost early on a year. For the full year, ready mix concrete shipments increase slightly with strong demand in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver markets, mostly offset by decreased energy sector shipments. Our actual shipments improved 4%. The building materials business reported record gross profit of $876 million, a 5% increase over the prior year. Ongoing pricing improvements coupled with the benefits from the strategic deployment of capital into our business contributed in part to 110 basis point expansion in the aggregates products line four year gross margin. The Southeast Group gross profit increased $17 million and gross margin expanded 280 basis points, driven by aggregates pricing and volume growth. The mid west division leverage recent investments in mobile equipment and reduced its repair cost 9% on a per unit basis and 4% on an absolute dollar basis, contributing to the mid America Group’s 170 basis points gross margin expansion. Our Magnesia Specialties business posted record revenues of $270 million, an increase of 5% compared with 2016. Higher energy and maintenance costs held gross profit in earnings from operations relatively flat. Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation to enhance share holder value. In 2017, we deployed $432 million of capital in our business, including mobile fleet purchases that have reduced ongoing repair and maintenance costs and returned $209 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we’ve returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. Currently, we have 14.7 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. In December, we successfully executed the largest bond deal in the Company's history, issuing $1.4 billion of debt in anticipation of closing the Bluegrass Materials Company acquisition in the first half of 2018. That transaction remains subject to customary regulatory process and other closing conditions. The bond deal itself was five times oversubscribed, allowing us to obtain favorable credit terms and establish 30 year benchmark bond we opened in a category of debt investors to the company. The newly issued debt reflects the weighted average interest rate of 3.5%. For the 12 months ended December 2017, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the applicable credit agreement, was 1.58 times. Pursuant to certain provisions of the credit agreement, the ratio excludes the debt issued in connection with the pending Bluegrass Materials acquisition. In summary, our ability to post record safety and operating results despite externally driven volume headwinds demonstrates the importance of our strategic plan as well as the Company’s ability to execute against that plan. Based on these strengths, our 2018 guidance, which is included in today’s release, reflects our optimism that Martin Marietta will continue to benefit from broadening demand across all three of our primary construction end use markets. As we look to 2018, we remain confident that the United States is in the midst of a steady albeit at extended cyclical recovery across our geographic footprint. While meaningful and consistent infrastructure activity has yet to materialize for the industry, we believe public heavy construction will gain traction in 2018 and as noted earlier, will likely continue and accelerate over the next several years. Third party forecast support increased construction spending in 2018, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets. We’re also encouraged by the long-term benefits from Martin Marietta, our customers and the industry from the 2017 FAST Act signed into law in December. This legislation provides strong signal and renewed confidence to employers, allowing for long-term solutions to address ongoing labor constraints and future capital investment needs. Equally important, passage of the 2017 Tax Act provides momentum for elected officials to address both increased as well as more sustainable infrastructure funding commensurate with the nation’s much needed investment. In that regard, as you’re likely aware, the administration has this week announced a framework for its long awaited infrastructure modernization plan. While more specific terms and timing of this plan will likely emerge from Congress during the second half of 2018, the presence broad out time calls for an additional $200 billion over the next decade to help facilitate this promised investment of $1.5 trillion in the nation’s roads, bridges, railways and water ways. Other policy objectives outlined in the administration’s infrastructure guideline are primarily fourfold, streamlining federal permitting, investing in rural projects, developing a skilled workforce and stimulating new investments. Notably, all the indications are that the White House is open to new sources of funding and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair, Bill Shuster, has indicated that the legislation needs to be bipartisan, principally responsible and make real long-term investments in our nation inflow. In short the reality of the 2017 Tax Act and the potential of infrastructure modernization R&D promising to our business and the nation. Please note, however, our 2018 guidance provided today does not reflect any benefits from potential legislation increasing federal infrastructure spending. Again, while expectations are that some form of enhanced infrastructure bill will be inactive in 2018, the benefits should more fully emerge in 2019. Yet even now, strong customer confidence and overall improving sentiment lead us to believe that infrastructure activity will benefit in 2018 and beyond from the FAST Act, the 2017 Tax Act and various state and local infrastructure initiatives. Positive employment and population trends in many of the attractive markets in which Martin Marietta operates support continued strength in private construction activity. Non-residential construction is expected to increase modestly in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years. Dodge Data & Analytics forecast the 3% increase in non-residential construction starts in 2018 and the Dodge Momentum Index, a monthly measure of initial non-residential construction planning, remains elevated after surging to 151.5 in December. With the price of oil somewhat rebounding, energy companies will look to grow and we expect the new energy related projects will bid in 2018 with construction activity in 2019 and beyond as regulatory permitting and final investment decisions are either made and/or approved. The residential market continues to expand, providing the impetus for future non-residential and infrastructure activity. Multi-family building remains solid in several of our top metropolitan areas. Additionally, in several key stage we're beginning to see grater levels of single family housing activity, which is more aggregates intensive. Robust residential construction is expected to continue, particularly in core Martin Marietta markets, driven by high employment, historically low levels of construction activity over the previous years, low mortgage rates, increased lot development and higher multi-family rental rates. For 2018, we expect aggregates shipments to increase 4% to 6%. Our outlook anticipates growth in all three primary aggregate construction end used markets and faster expansion into West and Southeast Groups and comparatively slower growth in the mid-America Group, which historically has generated the company’s highest margins. To be more specific; expectations are for infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid single digits; non-residential volumes to increase in the low to mid single digits; residential shipments to increase in the high single digits; and ChemRock/Rail shipments to remain stable. Aggregates product line pricing is expected to increase 3% to 5% with total revenues ranging from $2.490 billion to $2.595 billion and gross profit from $655 million to $715 million. For the rest of the building materials business, we expect cement revenues to range from $415 million to $445 million and gross profit from $140 million to $160 million, and ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving revenues to range from $1.370 billion to $1.445 billion, and gross profit from $160 million to $175 million. Our Magnesia Specialties business is expected to have another solid year with revenues ranging from $265million to $270 million in gross profit from $85 million to $90 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenue to range from $4.160 billion to $4.355 billion; gross profit from $1.40 billion to $1.140 billion; selling, general and administrative expenses from $275 million to $285 million; and EBITDA to range from $1.75 million to $1,185million. Interest expense is expected to range from $125 million to $130 million, reflecting the company’s $1.4 billion bond issuance. As a result of recent 2017 Tax Act, management expects the company's effective tax rate to range from 20% to 22%, excluding discrete events in 2018 versus 2017’s guidance of 28%. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million as we continued prudently deploy capital into our business. As noted, our 2018 guidance excludes any benefit from potential increase in federal infrastructure funding and any benefit from the pending acquisition of Bluegrass Materials, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share and cash flow in the first full year of ownership. To conclude 2017 was remarkable year for Martin Marietta. EBITDA of over $1 billion and the best safety and financial performance in the company’s history. Building on this movement, we’re confident in Martin Marietta’s long-term outlook. Looking ahead to 2018, we’re well positioned to capitalize on the durable mutli-year construction recovery across our geographic footprint and anticipated increased demand for infrastructure projects and private sector construction activity. In 2018 and beyond, we remain committed to world-class safety standards, price leadership, diligent cost discipline and operational excellence as we elevate Martin Marietta from an aggregates industry leader to a globally recognized world-class organization and further enhance long-term shareholder value. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.
Kathryn Thompson: First is just on system guidance. Could you give a little bit more color in terms of important drivers for assumptions, including the rising diesel costs and the ability to make-up for those lost volumes in 2017 from storms? Thank you.
Ward Nye: We see volume better in every major market in which we operate. So if we look across our space, we don’t see volume down anywhere. If we look at the elite eight states in which we operate meaning, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Indiana and Iowa, we see all those states up pretty markedly. And we don’t see them up in one area, we see infrastructure being better, we see non-res better and we see residential being better, to answer your question very directly. With respect to energy itself, we do see diesel going up year-over-year. Based on the guidance that we put out at least baked into our guidance, let’s not call it out specifically. We are seeing the diesel for the year be up around $0.44 per gallon in ‘18 versus where it was in ’17. The quick math is going to tell you that’s going to be plus, minus an incremental $20 million. And in case you’re wondering we used about 44.8 million gallons of diesel fuel last year. So that’s how we work out to those numbers. I hope that’s helpful.
Kathryn Thompson: And I assume are you -- you're assuming that you will or won’t make up for those total loss volumes from storm?
Ward Nye: What we’re assuming is that we will make-up some of them. We’re not assuming that we’ll make-up all of them. And again, we’ll just see how that flows through but at least as this point that’s how we bake that in Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson: Given a little choppy end to the quarter, there is some part says that there are many parts in the U.S. that did really quite well. But there were certain ones including Texas where they just can’t seem to catch a break when it comes to the all important work. So if you look forward into 2018, could you walk through either the inter quarter cadence from Q4 ’17 and may be what we’re looking forward into early 2018 and with that may mean in terms of the longer term look.
Ward Nye: Kathryn, if you go back over the last two years what we’ve seen in both '16 and '17, we’re actually pretty mild Q1. So we’ve seen better Q1 on a compared basis for last two years than we would have seen historically in the company. So here is what I’ll tell you. If we go back and look at the last couple of years and I'm looking at these percentages as the percentage of the year. So we would have seen revenues in Q1 in ’16 and ’17 of around 21%, we would have gross profit in Q1 in '17 around 16% and EBITDA about 15% of full year. Now if we go back and say really what does it look like over a longer period of time and take a look at what that snapshot looks like, it looks more like revenues 17%, it looks more like a gross profit of 8% and an EBITDA of around 8%. One thing that I’ll remind you and we talk a lot about this, but it’s important to remember at this time of the year in particular, typically the first quarter is made or broken in the last two weeks of March, I mean that’s what we’ve seen forever, that’s usually when the construction season starts in earnest. So what I would encourage you to think about Kathryn is the more typical cadence to the year and what I’ve just given you at least relative to Q1 the last couple of years, but more likely Q1 over a longer term is the way that I would think about it. So I hope that helps.
Kathryn Thompson: And then finally on fly ash, so you’ve been watching shortage of gypsum and also fly ash throughout the U.S. impacting different industries, and we definitely noticed a tightness and ability to get fly ash in State of Texas in particular. Is this something that you’re also seeing and also clarify how that may or may not impact your cement operations?
Ward Nye: Well, the short answer is yes, we're seeking it. And I think it will provide some choppiness for ready mix producers in parts of the United States. Keep in mind we're the largest producer of cement in Texas. So I think you can provide some choppiness for people for let's call it six, seven, eight weeks, I think it certainly could. From a cement suppliers’ perspective, look if there is not fly ash, we're happy to fill that void with cement and it think we can do that just fine. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good place from that prospective Kathryn.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens, Inc. Your question please.
Trey Grooms: First one from me Ward is on the aggregate selling price guidance of 3% to 5%. Are you expecting any product mix impact within that range? I know there was some expectation I think for some more base stone to be shipped this year maybe than what we saw last year just based on the projects that are out there. Is that still the case? And is that baked into the range? And if so, what’s going to be the approximate impact you’re expecting there.
Ward Nye: It certainly is. There are two things that I would tell you are in that, and it’s hard to tease it all out with specific trade. But I do think you're going to see more infrastructure work this year than last year. I think you're going to see more new infrastructure work than last year. That does mean that you're going to have more base product going up and that’s clearly on average about 30% lower ASP as opposed to clean stone that’s going directly into ready mix or into asphalt. So I think that is going to matter. The other thing that I think we called out fairly clearly is we think growth on a relative basis is going to be more robust in portions of the West. So again if we’re looking at places like Texas and Colorado, those markets are still, let’s call it, 70% of corporate average. So there is clearly some of that. So when we’re looking at the 3 to 5, you could probably take that up half return-ish or so as we look at what pricing will be if you’re really looking same on same. The other thing that I’d tell you is there are couple of things last year too that are important to remember relative to the pricing that we reported. Number one, we did see some product mix issues in Texas in 2017, because I want to remember, we did finished some large energy related projects at the end of ’16 that were principally used in clean stone. If we really do a same-on-same, you probably would have seen another percentage maybe a little bit more than that up just in the Southwest division all by itself. And we also had some excess build portfolio in many respects what’s almost the waste product that we sold or feel on a bypass job in North Carolina. And we sold about a million tons of that at $1.76 last year. I give you all that background number one as a reminder that those were in last year’s number. And two just give you a sense of how constructive, we think that piece of the business continues to work overall last year and what we feel like is very attractive outlook for this year.
Trey Grooms: And then just to understand on the tail end of seeing more base rock, which sounds like could be the case at least for some of this year behind that comes more of the higher ASP stone. Does that come pretty quickly or what’s the general lag there?
Ward Nye: It can come relatively quickly depending on the nature of the projects. It could be anywhere from two to six months would not be unusual lag time so again, depending on the time of the year. And you make a very good point. If base stone is going down, the day in the hours going to become that asphalt or concrete is going to go on top of that base stone. So it’s important to recognize when we’re having a conversation with you around more base stone from where we sit that’s a very good sign. And it goes back to the comments that I gave in the prepared remarks relative to this being an extended cycle. And those are some of the very few reasons that we think the cycle will be extended.
Trey Grooms: Last one from me just on Bluegrass the pending acquisition there. You mentioned that it is progressing, I think you’re still looking for first half ’18 closing. But could you give us any more color around how that’s going. I know you put out some very high level detail on some volume and revenue I think through September. But any updated thoughts on around accretion or potential divestitures that maybe required or anything like that?
Ward Nye: Well, here is what I would say. The process with DOJ is going exactly as we thought it would, so there have been no surprises there. As you may recall, we spoke last time about entering into a timing arrangement with them. So we continue to work in a fashion that we think is really constructive. We are not seeing anything from that process that makes us think about this transaction any differently than we did today that we announced this transaction. So to the extent that there are divestitures, the divestitures will not be such that they’re value disruptive to the transaction, so again exactly the way that we thought of it. We have also not changed the way financially that we think about this deal. It will be accretive on EPS and cash flow during the first full year. We’ll obviously talk to you more about that in granular detail once we own it. Since we don’t own those assets yet today, we still have to be careful about what we say in public that we have it already. But again, we're excited about that deal; we like the fact that we’re picking it up when places like Georgia are 20% below mid-cycle; we're seeing literally billions of dollars worth of work coming in Maryland; we think we're the right owner; those are the right geographies; it’s got a very bright future; and we're very comfortable with where we are in the DOJ process; and our timing has not changed on transaction.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier from Citi. Your question please.
Scott Schrier: Ward, first question I want to ask you is how are you seeing the FAST Act and how are customers looking at that versus waiting for more certainty from a federal bill. And the same goes for some of those state measures. When I think about the mid single digit increase in infrastructure volumes, it seems very positive. It seems like it’s a step up from potentially how the conversation was growing in November when we spoke. So I'm just curious what’s giving you the conviction given the softness that we’ve seen that one that we’re able to have that level of increase. And also to touch on what you talked about last quarter, where the big theme was inefficiencies at the state DOT level. Are you seeing some of those large gems making some progress to enable mid single digit and infrastructure growth?
Ward Nye: I guess the couple of things that I would say. Number one, I think if we generally spoke to people who are looking at their businesses at a granular level back in October and November. And so how do you feel then and how do you feel now. I think generally speaking people feel better today than they did then. And your question is why, I think for several reasons. One if we talk to our customers and we're talking to contractors, the level of work that they have and what they see ahead of them is encouraging to them. And if it’s encouraging to them and they are talking to us about supply, it’s encouraging to us. So we're hearing that from third party. Number two, if we’re simply looking at what we have in our backlog. And so if we're looking at our ready mix business in Texas today, for example, we have ready mix backlogs in Texas that are higher than any point since we’ve own that business. And remember we picked up the vast majority of that with the TXI transaction several years ago, so that what we’re seeing there, it’s attractive. The other piece of it has been the conversations that we've had with different BOTs around the country because they recognized that they had initial. So one of the conversations that I had with the secretary of transportation of southern state went along the lines of, look, I’ve got a high class problem, I’ve got $2 billion worth of work that I need to get out and the governor wants me to get that out and the legislation wants me to be get that out, and by the way I want to get that out. And one of the ways that they are dealing with that and here is part of the change that we’ve seen, Scott, is they’re dealing more with third party architects and engineering firms. So to the extent that BOT have had issues hiring or re-staffing up they are using resources in a much more constructive fashion now than they ever have in the past. And the fact is that’s probably a pretty good model for them, because it lets them control their internal costs, it lets them put out a good specification product. But again I think what we will see and what we started to see in portions of Q4, we're starting to see those projects release and simply seeing those projects release I think is one reason that you’re seeing a better feel and a better tone from people in our business and our customers. I hope that helps.
Scott Schrier: And then for the quarter, looking at the margins, which were obviously strong I know optically strong price and declining volumes makes incrementals look inflated. But can you speak to any cost control or anything else that you may have achieved in the quarter that seem to drive that operational performance and is that something that we should see going into the future?
Ward Nye: Well, I guess, there are couple of things that happened there. Did we have good pricing? We did. Did we have good cost control? We did. And did we put some more inventories in the ground anticipating a busy 2018? We did some of that too. I don’t want to completely overshadow the fine performance that the team did. But I would highlight there were some inventory builds out there. But the majority of it was the pricing and what we’re doing from an efficiency perspective, but it should have that one off. I mean, you had incrementals with 100 in front of it. And that’s not usual for Q4. But still, it was the performance that we are justifiably very proud of.
Scott Schrier: And one last one on cement, the guidance looks like at the midpoint, it’s quite year-on-year increasing gross profit. Just seem if you could parse out potential your different market and the drivers whether it’s the volumes and pricing, obviously you did a good job holding it and how you’re thinking about the cement business more granular in Texas? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Keep in mind, we are the cement volume leader in Texas and we’ve got plants there, so one in Midlothian North Texas, one at Hunter just outside of San Antonio. I guess the couple of things, one we saw a good finish to 2017. We think that really set the stage for a positive 2018. Q4 volumes are positive in both north and South Texas and we have an expectation that we’ll see volume and pricing increases in 2018 as well. We think there continue to be very strong underlying economic conditions in that state. We think we’re going to see better DOT this year, I mean we’re seeing that DOT delta up from a 6 to last year up to 79 this year, so that’s $1.7 billion more just in that all by itself. We also have a new yard in New Caney outside Houston. We also have some material we’re going to be supplying a little bit in Western Texas, as well. And really that’s more focused just on the south end of it. We also think what we’re going to see in North Texas this year is going to be a very exciting, very full, very dynamic market. So as we’re looking at that marketplace with more volumes and we’re looking for some price increases there that they’re probably going to be around that $6 a ton range, probably a little bit better in the north than it is for the south. And you take those and put them together, we think it’s going to be a pretty attractive place. The other thing that I’ll bring your attention to is if you look at our share by quarter in 2017, we had 21.4% in Q1, 20.9% into 19.1% in Q3, that’s when we spoke last and 20.2% by year-end. And you started seeing this capture some of the share that we had lost in many respects, because we have been resilient on pricing. We think our strategy is working in that marketplace and we will continue to be very thoughtful about how we capture a bit more share than the overall Texas marketplace. But Scott helpfully that gives you a good drive by on what we see in Texas cement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Jerry Revich: Ward, can you talk us about what you're seeing for your shale related shipments, how did the year end up, what's your anticipation of the ramp in '18 for that part of the business as you speak to your customers. And can you just calibrate us on a run rate basis, how diversified is this business is by shale play?
Ward Nye: Happy to do that Jerry. And what I would say is the shale finished up nicely at the end of the year. I gave you some numbers. These are probably a bit surprisingly. Our volumes to shale in Q4 were up 43%. If we look to the full year, they were up 24%. We think that’s a positive outlook for 2018, particularly as we see the WTI state nicely above $50 on a per barrel price. Again, obviously, what we're seeing lately is around $61, we think that continues to drive people toward greater energy efficient or energy related jobs. Here’s what are those Jerry, if you go back overtime, what that means is in 2017 we sold almost 1.8 million tons to different shale plays. And when I say that, we sold some in Niobrara, we sold some in Marcellus, we sold some into Barnet, Eagle Ford, Avard and Haynesville for let’s call it total 1.8, which doesn’t sound bad until you go back overtime and say what does that look like in 2014 that was the peak. We sold almost 7.5 million tons to those same different plays in 2014. So 1.8 in '17 versus what was about 7.5 in 2014. And look do I think 7.5 is a normalized run rate, short answer is no. But do I think a normal shale demand should be in that three to four million ton range or 50% higher than we are today, I do think that’s probably a pretty realistic outlook for it. I'm not saying that’s going to be the outlook for this year, but I'm saying as we look at non-res numbers that should continue to grow for us. This is certainly going to be a piece of it and we're still at places that we feel like in shale are quite low, so I appreciate your question on that, because that is the big delta from where it was several years ago to where it was last year even though last year was better.
Jerry Revich: And Ward just the cadence so you mentioned you're exiting the year up 43% year-over-year in this business the comps should be equally easy through the first half of the year. So I know we're talking about the small numbers here. But is that the ramp that you expect based on what you're hearing from your customers similar through the first half of the year in that mid 40s exit rate?
Ward Nye: I think you could certainly see that type of building, and I would expect more of that to start in Q2 simply because of the weather issue that are inherent in Q1. And keep in mind, if you're selling into our Marcellus or Niobrara, that’s a very different Q1 than is Eagle Ford, for example. So I think a lot of its going to depend on where. But I will say this from a percentage prospective the three areas that did get the most better in Q4 would have been Barnet at 38% up, Eagle Ford at 130% and Haynesville at 51% up. So that gives you a snapshot of at least where the action is and hopefully what the time we're looking feel like.
Jerry Revich: And then separately from a pricing standpoint, I know we’ve got moving piece in terms of which regions are driving growth for you folks in '18 versus '17. As you look across your markets, how do you expect the magnitude of price increases on January 1st and April 1st of this year and compare to what you saw last year and any differences in terms of parts of the footprint where you’re going earlier or later in construction season with your planned price increases this year.
Ward Nye: You know what, it varies at lot Jerry. And I’d rather not go into very specific markets and talk about dollars and cents on any given market, but here what I’ll say. Clearly, there are some markets that will see increases and have seen increases on January 1st. There are others that will go as late as April 1st. So we’re not seeing things past April 1st. The one thing that’s work reflecting on and I mentioned early in the conversations some of the diesel costs. Diesel in a rising cost circumstance has clearly been something that has continued to at least pop-up in past what has been some with your price increases, we’ll have to see how the year shapes out on that and have to see what happens with diesel. But again from a pricing perspective, many in January some in March a few in April is the way that I would encourage you think about that, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your question please.
Philip Ng: Based on your guidance it appears incremental margins for aggregate business is going to be little lower than that 60% historical run rate. Just curious how to that is mix in diesel. And do you expect that incremental margin profile to return back to 60% level in 2019?
Ward Nye: I think the big issue there is going to be on the where. So if we go back to the guidance and really think about what’s in the guidance itself and how it rolls up, I mean if we’re looking at the low end of that guidance what the low end of that guidance would assume is that you’ve got flat Mid-Atlantic volumes and Southeast just up mid-single-digit versus our forecast of high mid-single-digits. So the short answer is if you’ve got Virginia and North Carolina and South Carolina going at greater rates than that, it’s clearly going to be a friend to the incremental margins. So it’s really going to be more of a story on the where. And one of the nice -- actually, the Secretary of Transportation here in North Carolina who I was referring to a little while ago, who is got the high class problem of having several billion dollars worth of work that he needs to get out the door. So we’re serving hoping that we see that. We have necessarily built a budget around that. But to give you a sense of it that’s really more your driver than anything else, because those are obviously our highest price, highest margin areas that we think have very bright futures. We’re a little bit cautious right now on exactly when that future shows up, but we like what we see.
Philip Ng: And then public spending remains weak, here’s the budget delays we’ve seen had any impact in the fourth quarter, and you’re expecting remain an overhang in 1Q and any risk in terms of impact in the peak construction season this year?
Ward Nye: I don’t see a big risk on the construction season this year. Again, I think it’s important to go back the answer I’ve given a little while ago relative to the cadence, because I do think historically people have tended to put more weight on a Q1 than Q1 really deserves. As I said really since last couple of weeks in March that at least in the 20 plus years that I’ve been around this industry tend to even make the quarter work or not, and I would just take to make a year back based on the last two weeks in March. I don’t see anything relative to state budgets or the federal budget that gives us any notable concern as we’re looking at. What we believe the construction season is going to look like when there is seasonal rise in earnest.
Philip Ng: And just one last one for me, you seem pretty constructive on a potential infrastructure bill. But just curious if you have any better line of sight on the funding aspect. And it appears to be a bigger reliance on the state level side of things from the funding standpoint. And lastly, is it your view that $200 billion federal funding piece will be incremental to FAST Act? Thanks.
Ward Nye: Its couple of things, I’ll start with your last question first. So I think everything that we’ve seen in the Trump infrastructure package is intended to be incremental. So there is not anything coming from what's already there to what’s going with this. I think several things are underway. I think the Trump proposal candidly starts the conversation relative to funding and financing. And I think that’s important thing to remember. I think we’re going to have to watch what comes out of congress relative to the funding piece in particular. So for example Chamber of Commerce is looking for $0.25 gas tax over five years, the American Trucking Association is looking for $0.20 over full year. And the reason that matters is you get $1.7 billion per penny so that’s clearly the easiest way to do that, and the quickest way to do it. The other thing that we need to keep in mind is there are host of different proposals that are still being discussed in congress. I think we're going to see this congress come forward with something that’s going to be in near term fix to really how we’re going to enhance infrastructure spending. But I think they are also going to want to address longer term what the pay force look like. That’s number one on what we see coming from this infrastructure act. The other piece that I think is really at the moment is what happens from a regulatory prospective, because that’s really going to be the place that you can see the game change pretty notably. Here is another anecdote for you. In talking to Secretary of Transportation again at the state level, I’ve been told that it’s not all unusual for getting projects to take 10 years to go through the normal regulatory environmental permitting process. So when we're listening to the news conference yesterday and the aim is to get it down to two years, that’s almost revolution, I mean, that changes the way that that’s going to work in a pretty notable way. And what I liked about what we’re seeing is the proposal doesn’t just say look we want to make it two years, it’s starts calling for very specific changes. So for example, the plan is its proposed for most EPA from wetlands permitting process and lease it solely with the Army Corp of Engineers. Similarly, it’s looking at different proposals under the Clean Air Act, and it’s basically saying look if you're trying to get this type of permitting done and you’re having to look at National Ambient Air Quality Standards that have been placed for a long time, really what you need start doing is just be focused on the newest regulatory standards that have been put in place and not going by the historic once that have been there. In other words, the Trump infrastructure plan relative to what's going on relative to funding and financing has a lot of conversation to go, but there is not as much conversation that’s ahead of us relative to the regulatory piece of it. And I will suggest to you in the near term, regulatory is almost more important than the dollars. The dollars will come, we're confident of that that. But again, as we look and contemplate what this is going to mean to us, the funding is one, the financing is another but the regulatory is really a big deal we think in the near term. So I hope that helped.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your question please.
Adam Thalhimer: With regards to the infrastructure up mid single-digits this year, Ward. Do you think that’s more back half weight or do you think that if that picks up along with the normal construction season in March?
Ward Nye: What I think it probably picks up with the normal construction season in March. I mean, if we just go through and look broadly at those big eight, those lead eight states we spoke of before, I mean TXDOT has a letting plan 7.9 billion this year versus 6.2 billion last year. I think we feel positive in Georgia as we feel like the House Bill $170 will start to again have much more notable effect. And we’ve talked about the fact that North Carolina we believe has a positive outlook and we’re seeing an accelerating letting schedule here. I think if we look at South Carolina and we say, they’ve done something that really is not typical for South Carolina, they raised their gas tax over a six-year period. I think we’ll clearly start to see more work there, and Indiana has done the same thing. And Florida is at a near record budget at $10 billion. And part of what we’re liking in Colorado right now which has been just really strong robust pay force is we continue to see big jobs letting that state. And here’s part of the difference that we’re seeing there. These are big complication jobs that are going. So if we’re looking at two large TIFIA projects and C-470 is one of them that’s underway, and I-70 will start in 2018 and that’s $1.7 billion worth of total investment. And part of the trick on those jobs is we think aggregates will be tight in that marketplace, and we think contractors are appropriately going to be focused on making sure they have aggregate suppliers and partners going into those jobs to actually meet their needs. So again I think we’re going to see a normal rhythm and cadence to it. I do think we need to get past March 15th, because in many states under DOT specifications, you can’t even really go for more on those projects until then, which goes back Adam to the earlier comment that I have that often times as last two weeks in the first quarter oddly enough to make it or break it. So I think we see a fairly normal consistent rhythm and cadence to public work as we go into 2018.
Adam Thalhimer: And then just a quick follow-up, you talked about an elongated recovery in the U.S. I’m just curious if there are any metro areas when you think we’re more late cycle than early cycle?
Ward Nye: I’ll tell you, I don’t see many in our footprint that feel that way. And as we look at a lot of non-residential forecasting that comes out, I think most of them would continue to concur on that. If we look at the South and the Southeast, those areas continue to have expectations pretty heavy growth. About the only places that we see any degree of contraction at least from third-party forecasters are really in markets where we’re not. So we’re seeing at least people forecast something that’s going to feel a little bit more like a pull back in portions of the North Eastern United States. But again, if we’re looking at those spaces that matter disproportionally to us, what I would suggest you is I don’t see anybody who feels like their peaky and they are about to go over that peak and we continue to see a lot of cities and among them places like Atlanta and Raleigh and Charlotte and others that we think are still pretty early in the cycle. And as you know from falling us for years, those are cities that tend to be disproportionately important to us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.
Stanley Elliott: Quick question, we’re talking about the elongated cycle and certainly you guys got some benefit from the tax planned. Does it change how you think about leverage over the near-term? And I asked that post Bluegrass and the dead deal you're at looking at mid to high two sorts of level, which is very reasonable I think where we are. But I would love to hear your thoughts whether additional M&A, buybacks where you’re heading that in terms of all that.
Jim Nickolas: Its Jim, I will take the question. There is no change to our capital priorities. So the right deal we’ll move on that make sense, as has been the case for years. But as it relates your question around debt and its relative attract of this with the new tax law, it’s obviously less attractive than it used to be, but it’s still obviously more attractive than the equity issuances. So we really don’t change too much from that perspective either. The tax law change does obviously give us more cash flow going forward and a greater ability to A, either delivery or B, pursue more acquisitions or share buybacks at the right point. So it just gives us more free cash flow to work with but I would say foundationally there is no difference in our approach to the capital allocation.
Stanley Elliott: And one housekeeping, on the cement pricing the $6. Is that -- are you assuming the midyear price increase in that or it’s a market not requiring that at this point.
Ward Nye: We started talking last year about cement price increases. So we think we're pretty much set with that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your question please. 
Craig Bibb: Going back to aggregates margins for a second, you invested in capacity during 2017. And it sounds like you were building inventory in the third quarter and sold that through in fourth quarter. And I guess is that right..
Ward Nye: It’s some in third, but there’s some in four, yes.
Craig Bibb: And what is the -- how meaningful is that a benefit to gross margin in Q4?
Ward Nye: I guess, let's go back to the five first and we can go back what the margin look like. So I guess what I would tell you, if we look at it from a platform matter, Craig, there are parts in the Mid West in particular where we wanted to make sure we had adequate inventories on the ground, because cracking up in that corner of the world is bit of a challenge. So that’s why you will go ahead and do that. But to your point, incremental is based on some of the inventory build or 100 plus percent -- I think probably would have been more in buy and maybe slightly ahead of our targets had we not done that. So you would have seen a very attractive incremental margin in Q4. The inventory just made it look phenomenally attractive, so just in the spirit of transparency.
Craig Bibb: And then which markets are construction labor constrained.
Ward Nye: Well, I guess what I would say is this. I want to say unemployment in parts of Indianapolis is about 1.8% typically people would say 2% its full employment. So that’s pretty constrained right now. But here is the issue that we’re running into we're not constraint from our perspective. In some instances it’s contractors have been constrained in some markets, but the observation that I would make to you is this Craig. When contractors need to move on jobs either because they’re concerned about liquidated damages or they want to get an incentive bonus for finishing early, my observation is they are able to meet those deadlines when they need to. I think contractors the more we see talk and the more we see action on an enhanced infrastructure project, I think they can hire in these markets. So I think in many respects they have chosen not to higher in these markets. And I think as we come into 2018, they’re going to be able to meet what the demand is and probably start positioning themselves for what we’ve indicated we believe is going to be an extended cycle.
Craig Bibb: Are your issues with CSX solved?
Ward Nye: CSX is working their way through what has been an extraordinary period of time. So, I clearly had a change in CEOs twice, one with Michael Ward’s retirement and then, sadly, with the death of Hunter Harrison. They clearly have had a change in their strategy. They went from really largely unit trains to more precision railroading, which means in their terminology, manifest service. I mean what that meant for portions of last year again in the spirit of transparency, they did have some longer cycle times. They did struggle at times with rail congestion. And I think on occasion they were resource limited. What I would tell you is we have had very constructive conversations with CSX. They have been good partners to us and continue to be good partners to us. And we’re seeing their performance improve over the last several months in terms of cycle times and fulfillment. So I am going to tell you that it’s perfect, exactly the way we would like to see it? No, I don’t think I can say that. Can I tell you that it’s considerably better, I can. And can I affirm to you that we expected to continue to get better through the year? Yes. And have we, in many respects, built those notions into what we put out as our guidance? Yes, we have as well.
Craig Bibb: And you’ve been talking for a little bit about, specifically North Carolina’s ability to actually get work let, the transition they’re undergoing. Are you seeing the work being let yet, or is it still two or three months out?
Ward Nye: I think we’re seeing that improve circumstance in North Carolina and my expectation is based on some of the dialogue that we’ll continue to get better. We’re going to bring a little bit of show me to North Carolina, we’re going to -- or Missouri to North Carolina, we’re going to wait for a little bit more show on that. But right now, the outlook is good. North Carolina has a very good secretary of transportation and he’s a visionary thoughtful leader. And I think he will do great things with DOT in the state.
Craig Bibb: Well, congratulations on world-class safety and $1 billion in EBITDA on the same year.
Ward Nye: Craig, we’ll take both of those. Actually, Craig, here’s the funny thing. If somebody had said to you last year, Hey, Martin Marietta is going to be down million tons year-over-year and they’re going to hit $1 billion, you probably wouldn’t taken that bet. I really have to give a shout out to our team they did a fantastic job and thank you for your comments.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please.
Garik Shmois: I just want to calibrate my modeling on incremental margins as we move through 2018. Ward, if I heard you right, with some of the inventory build in Q4 and assuming normal seasonality, is it fair to assume just Q1 incrementals will be potentially meaningfully although your full year guidance to then incremnetals as you move through, I mean the construction season is going to be above the full year guidance than maybe even looking closer to that traditional 60% range that you hit?
Ward Nye: That’s certainly the right way to think about that. I mean, I would never expect in the normal circumstance with the normal January and February and early March to have the types of incrementals that we’ev talked about through a cycle across the enterprise. So the short answer is yes. I think you should typically expect to see a build on those through the year. In a normal time what I would tell you is you should typically expect to probably see them peak in late Q3 or early Q4. And part of what happened this year Garik is candidly, October showed up in November. I think the short answer is I think a lot of people were looking at a wet October, which is usually the busiest month of the year in the aggregates industry. And it wasn’t because the weather and then November ended up being a very strong November. So yes, the way you’re thinking about incremental is the right way.
Garik Shmois: And then just one question on cement. Are you seeing any trend of imports just bleeding your way from the Huston market to Central Texas or North Texas, would there be any potential impacts to your pricing guidance if that was the case?
Ward Nye: We're not seeing anything notable that happened -- that's happening in that respect certainly, not in North Texas. Obviously, you’ve get some activity at the port in Huston and in South Texas. But again, the competitive issues that are underlying in that state have all been taken into account and the forecast that we put out here.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO for any further remarks.
Ward Nye: Thank you again for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and demonstrated record performance continue to provide a firm foundation to enhancing long-term shareholder value and underscores our confidence in Martin Marietta long term outlook. We very much look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results in April. Until then, thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President-Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.
Suzanne Osberg - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim joined Martin Marietta in August from Caterpillar, where he most recently led the Corporate Development Group. Prior to that, Jim served in separate stints as Group Chief Financial Officer of Caterpillar's Resources Industry segment, as well as its Global Mining Business unit. I want to welcome Jim to his first Martin Marietta earnings call. To facilitate today's discussion, as we have done in the past, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. As detailed on slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. In addition, any margin references in today's teleconference are based on total revenues, which is different from previous reports where margins were based on net sales and excluded freight and delivery revenues. Any non-GAAP measures discussed today are explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our website and in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Suzanne, and let me add my welcome to both you and Jim to your first earnings call. It's a pleasure to have each of you here. As announced in this morning's release, we delivered solid operating and safety results that demonstrate our company's ability to successfully adapt to external challenges. The quarter can best be summarized by momentum in both pricing and private sector construction activity, which was offset by softer than expected infrastructure demand. To some extent, the softness reflects the impact from continuing record precipitation including hurricanes Harvey and Irma. First and foremost though, we are grateful that our employees and their families are safe in the aftermath of these natural disasters. Our thoughts remain with all the people in affected areas as they begin to rebuild their lives and communities. These hurricanes caused short-term dislocations and work stoppages throughout August and September and reduced revenues and earnings in what has historically been our most profitable quarter. Furthermore, as employment reaches record levels and many of the attractive markets in which Martin Marietta operates, contractors continue to be faced with labor shortages, leading them to accept a slower, steadier pace to project work while generally maintaining robust multi-quarter backlogs often up to 18 months. In addition, departments of transportation in several of our key states are also understaffed exacerbating infrastructure project delays. Given the third quarter's volume headwinds, we remain focused on the long-term aspects of our business that we can meaningfully impact: price leadership, prudent cost discipline, safety and operational excellence. Notwithstanding weather, we achieved record quarterly earnings per share, excluding the $12 million impact of non-recurring repair costs for certain of the company's leased railcars. For clarity, that non-recurring railcar expense is $0.12 per fully diluted share. Our results for the quarter were also highlighted by improvements in pricing and gross margins. Notably, pricing increased across all product lines and segments, and aggregates product line gross margin improved 180 basis points. The Mid-America Group, which experienced less operational disruption from this season's hurricane activity than our other groups, expanded its third quarter gross margin 330 basis points. However, this group, and specifically the Mid-Atlantic division, experienced heavy precipitation, as portions of both North Carolina and South Carolina dealt with the 2017 hurricane season, which is among history's top 10 most active. And their aggregates product line shipments declined 2%. Also noteworthy, our employees achieved record safety performance through the first nine months of 2017 with consolidated total injury incident rate that's nearing world class. A majority of our divisions are already at that level. These accomplishments, particularly in the face of volume headwinds, underscore the benefits of our foundational focus on safety and operational excellence and the importance of our leading position in many of the nation's most attractive markets. Our Building Materials business, which as a reminder includes aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations, continues to benefit from strong underlying market fundamentals. Aggregates product line pricing improved 5%, led by the Southeast Group's nearly 10% increase. The Mid-America and West Groups reported pricing growth of 6% and 1% respectively. Geographic and product mix reduced aggregates product line pricing for the Southwest division, which is a part of the West Group, by 120 basis points, as several large energy projects requiring higher price materials were completed in 2016. Cement pricing improved 4% during the quarter. Our ready-mixed concrete and asphalt average selling prices increased 5% and 12% respectively. Shipment levels for the Building Materials business varied considerably across our geographic footprint, but overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, cement shipments declined 10%, ready-mixed concrete shipments declined 13%, and asphalt shipments declined 11%. Near record precipitation across a wide portion of our footprint, coupled with disruptions from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, resulted in estimated shipment volumes reductions of 2.1 million tons of aggregates, 40,000 tons of cement and 300,000 cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete. The West Group's aggregate shipments were most negatively affected by weather, particularly in Texas, which experienced its fourth wettest third quarter in the last 123 years and decreased 7%. Daily aggregates product line shipments for our Houston district averaged 23,000 tons in August for days not impacted by precipitation. Following Hurricane Harvey, these operations were shut down for five days. Shipment levels did not return to the August daily average until the ninth business day of September. That reprieve lasted only two days before more substantial rainfall fell in the area, preventing shipments from reaching the daily 23,000-ton level again until the last business day of September. Martin Marietta's impacts from Hurricane Irma were less harmful, and combined with the strong underlying market demand, allowed our Georgia and Florida facilities to resume operations at or above their respective three-year averages within a week of the hurricane. Overall, the Southeast Group generated a 5% increase in third quarter aggregate shipments. The recent hurricane activity also affecting our quarterly cost and efficiency profile, particularly in the West Group. Fortunately, we experienced limited physical damage, and repair costs were less than $1 million, indicative of the commendable efforts of our operating teams in executing our disaster preparedness plan. Still, fuel supply constraints following the hurricanes caused a spike in diesel prices, resulting in an 11% increase in diesel fuel costs companywide when compared with the average price per gallon paid during the first six months of the year. Other hurricane-related impacts are equally real, though not as easy to quantify with specificity. For example, production levels were lower than planned as we redirected teams to respond to the hurricanes, putting downward pressure on leverage and operating efficiencies. We also experienced logistic bottlenecks, as western railroads did not resume normal operations to our Houston distribution yards until mid-September. Importantly, we view these disruptions and dislocations as temporary. As we have seen with previous weather disasters, such as 2012's 500-year flooding event in Colorado and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, natural disaster-related reconstruction efforts typically call for years of steady and needed building activity. Tightened labor markets, in both the public and private sectors, continue to result in project delays and hinder significant growth in construction activity. Many state departments of transportation are understaffed, thereby limiting the number of new projects stemming from the additional infrastructure funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, and other state and local initiatives. Similarly, our customers are experiencing labor construction shortages, particularly in Texas, Colorado, the Carolinas, Georgia and Iowa, and many have pushed start dates for new projects into 2018. We believe the lack of progress over key elements of federal policies, specifically healthcare, tax reform and infrastructure funding, continues to exert downward pressure on both public and private construction activity. As we have seen historically, uncertainty around the federal government fosters inaction on the parts of states and contractors to advance construction projects or undertake significant capital investment. Our Magnesia Specialties business reported third quarter total revenues of $64 million, a decrease of 2% compared with the prior year, reflecting inventory adjustment by several large chemical customers due to their unplanned downtime. The timing of the business' kiln outages, coupled with higher energy and maintenance costs, led to a lower gross profit and earnings from operations. I want to reiterate our commentary in today's earnings release. We are confident in Martin Marietta's long-term outlook, with fundamental drivers for broad-based construction activity supporting a steady and extended yet somewhat slower-than-anticipated cyclical recovery across our geographic footprint. We expect aggregate shipments to grow modestly until pro-growth initiatives emerge. So, while the growth curve may be a bit less steep, the duration of the cycle will likely be extended. This underpins our confidence in the company's long-term outlook. The infrastructure market comprised 42% of third quarter aggregates product line volumes, somewhat below the company's most recent five-year average of 44%. We've yet to see meaningful growth in related heavy construction activity, even though the building blocks to address the need for significant infrastructure investment exist. As state departments of transportation and contractors address labor constraints and regulatory reform emerges, infrastructure activity should benefit more tangibly from the funding provided by the FAST Act. Additionally, state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases and other valid initiatives passed over the preceding 24 months will continue to play an expanded role in public sector activity. Non-residential volumes represented 32% of aggregates product line shipments in the third quarter, driven primarily by office, retail and warehouse projects, along interstate corridors particularly in the Mid-America and Southeast groups which reported strong industrial construction growth. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2016, we supplied aggregates, cement and ready-mixed concrete to several large energy sector projects in Texas that were not replaced in the back half of 2017 as was originally anticipated. Looking ahead, additional energy-related economic activity including follow-on public and private construction will be mixed. But even here, with the price of oil somewhat rebounding, energy companies are again looking to grow rather than retrench. While the pace of permitting and final investment decisions has been more cautious, we expect new energy-related projects should enter the bid phase in 2018 with construction activity in 2019 and beyond. Overall, non-residential construction is expected to modestly increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. The residential market, which accounted for 19% of third quarter aggregates product line shipments, continues to expand providing the impetus for future non-residential and infrastructure activity. Multi-family building remained solid in several of our top metropolitan areas. Additionally, in several key states, we're beginning to see greater levels of single-family housing activity which is more aggregates intensive. Robust residential construction is expected to continue particularly in core Martin Marietta markets driven by high employment; historically, low levels of construction activity over the previous years; low mortgage rates; higher lot development; and higher multi-family rental rates. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Colorado, six of Martin Marietta's key states rank in the top 10 for growth in single-family housing unit permits. To conclude our discussion of end-use markets, ChemRock/Rail accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes and declined versus the prior-year quarter driven by lower balanced sales. Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation to enhance shareholder value. The company's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and include the right value enhancing acquisitions that align the company's strategic growth plan, organic capital investment and the return of cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and share repurchases. The company's previously announced acquisition of Bluegrass Materials Company is expected to close in the first half of 2018. The company and Bluegrass Materials are continuing to work closely and cooperatively with the United States Department of Justice and its review of the transaction. We deployed $309 million of capital in our business during the first nine months of 2017, including mobile fleet purchases that will reduce ongoing repair and maintenance costs. We increased our annual cash dividend by 5%. And since the February 2015 announcement of our share repurchase program, we've returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Currently, we have 14.7 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in applicable credit agreement for the trailing 12 months ended September 2017 was 1.7 times in compliance with our leverage covenant. In summary, extraordinary weather, construction-related labor shortages, project delays and government uncertainty have impeded expected shipment growth throughout the year and certainly in the third quarter. As a result, this morning's release reflected the revision of our full-year 2017 guidance as follows. We expect the aggregates product line shipments to range from down 1% to up 1% with infrastructure shipments expected to decrease in the mid-single-digits. Non-residential volumes expected to remain relatively flat. Residential shipments expected to increase in the high single-digits. And ChemRock/Rail shipments expected to decrease in the low double-digits. Aggregates product line pricing is expected to increase 4% to 5%. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues ranging from $3.87 billion to $3.97 billion, gross profit ranging from $910 million to $960 million and EBITDA ranging from $940 million to $985 million. Despite compelling underlying fundamentals in 2017, expected shipment volume growth failed to materialize. Looking beyond 2017 and consistent with the macroeconomic picture we described, we expect growth in all three primary end-use markets over the next several years. Our preliminary 2018 view sees higher growth most notably in the West and Southeast groups with comparatively slower growth in portions of the Mid-America Group, which historically has generated the company's highest margins. For 2018, overall aggregate shipments are expected to increase in the mid-single-digits as the construction sector continues to face both labor constraints and governmental uncertainty that serve to inhibit a more enhanced rate of growth. This preliminary outlook excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Bluegrass Materials and any benefit from a potential increase in federal infrastructure spending. To conclude, we're proud of our results and our employees' ability to manage through short-term disruptions while remaining focused on safety and the long-term growth of our business. Our leading positions in many of the nation's most attractive and otherwise vibrant markets reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to capitalize on the durable, multi-year construction recovery. Our customers maintain positive near and medium-term outlooks over the next several years, supported by their reported strong backlogs. We're well positioned to benefit from the expected demand for infrastructure projects and private sector construction activity as regulatory reform emerges and departments of transportation and customers address labor constraints. With a relentless focus on world-class safety standards, diligent cost discipline and operational excellence, we remain committed to achieving industry-leading results and further enhancing long-term shareholder value. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First question is really more on the quarter, and then I'm going to step back a little bit more strategically for following question. But the first two deal with more volume and pricing. On the volume side, could you help us frame the relative underperformance of concrete and asphalt volumes in the quarter? And really trying to get a better understanding of how much of this is due to timing versus storms versus something more fundamental.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Kathryn, good morning. Thanks for your question, too. A couple of things on cement and concrete in particular. When we're talking about those two products, it's principally a Texas conversation. It's not wholly, because, clearly, we have a very attractive ready-mixed business in Colorado, but most of our cubic yards are in Texas. So, a couple of things. Were both of those businesses impacted by Harvey? Absolutely. Did weather interfere? It did. Did energy? And what was going on and not going on with diesel fuel also interfere with those businesses? No question. One thing, though, too, from a volume perspective that clearly affected the quarter – and, by the way, I'm going to be unapologetic about it, we are price leaders in that marketplace. Particularly in cement, we feel like we have a very viable product in, what I believe, is going to be the most dynamic building materials market in the United States, specifically around Dallas, for probably the next 25 years. And we have held the line on some pricing in that marketplace because we felt like that was simply the right thing to do for our business. If you go back and look at the Comptroller's report that obviously comes out every month, what you'll see is we did lose some market share in that marketplace because of it. I think if you typically look at that, you'll see it's a 22%, 23% market share in Texas. I think the latest number has us down to about 18%. So, clearly taking some leadership positions there caused us some volume. Do I anticipate that we'll see some of that going come back? I do. What I also tell you, we're going to be judicious in the way that we get it, absolutely we will. So, what I would say, Kathryn, with respect to both cement for the reasons that I've just articulated and frankly for many of the same reasons relative to ready-mixed, we saw volume headwinds because of weather, we also saw volume headwinds because of our approach to pricing in that marketplace.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: And, could you give a little bit more color around the asphalt shortfall too?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely, I can do that. I mean, asphalt, as you recall, is really a Denver-driven business for us. And we were hit with extremely wet weather in Colorado. We saw considerably less uptime for our crews in that particular marketplace than we did last year. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the market in Colorado at all. I mean, to give you a sense of it, Colorado Springs experienced the wettest July since 1948 when records were first recorded in that marketplace. So, if we look at the ready-mixed concrete business today – the hot-mix asphalt business today and what we think that will be for the rest of this year and frankly into next year, that has been and will continue to be a very attractive business. The balance of the year in that business for us in Colorado will be driven purely and simply by whatever happens with weather for the rest of the year. But I mean, as we get to this point of the year, literally, we lost 56 production shifts versus 25 in the prior-year quarter and all that's driven by weather. And you can effectively see that number nearly double quarter-over-quarter and not feel a modest headwind there, but there is nothing fundamentally at all that has changed from that very attractive business.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: And quick clean up on the pricing question to, more related to the West Group. To what extent did – and knowing that West Group pricing was up about 1%, to what extent were the optics of pricing impacted by storms?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We had two things. Number one, when we're talking about the West Group in many respects, Kathryn, we're talking about two things, what's happening in Colorado and what's happening in Texas. Let me talk about Colorado first. Because we've indicated over time, you should see ASPs going up there at a rate higher than the corporate average. And what we saw in Rocky Mountain was ASPs up 7%. So, what we anticipated happening in that marketplace is entirely what's happening in that marketplace. If we look at the South West division, the ASP was negatively impacted by about 120 basis points due to product mix and geographic mix. So, we clearly saw a shift from clean stone and sand to lower priced base stone in that marketplace. So that clearly provided a headwind. The only marketplace that we really saw any degree of red around pricing was in that South Texas area for all the reasons that you would imagine.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thank you. Final question on Bluegrass. Could you just give a little bit more color on the extension that anticipated close of this transaction? And any other color around that would be helpful. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. Sure, happy to do that. Where we sit right now is exactly where we thought we would from a process perspective and that we're working together with U.S. DOJ and that's a very normal process. We did receive a second request, which we fully anticipated. We did enter into a timing commitment with DOJ. And the primary reason that you do that if you're us is, you want to give DOJ adequate time to review all the submitted information. What I'll tell you is, they have a lot of submitted information. We're very engaged with them as you would expect us to. What it essentially does is it puts in the position that we're not going to certify substantial compliance with the second request until we get to a point in time that we have agreed with DOJ. One of the issues that I'm sure they're concerned about is once we certify substantial compliance that puts some real deadlines on DOJ to come back and finish their work. What we'll tell you is, there's been nothing surprising in the second request whatsoever. We're focused only on a few areas. As you would imagine, the vast majority of our teams internally are focusing on integration plans. We anticipate as we said in today's release closing this in the first half of 2018. So this continues to go along the line that we anticipated that it would when we closed the transaction. I hope that's helpful and responsive to your question, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Got it. Yes, it is. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Ward, you mentioned in the press release and then again in your prepared remarks that as you kind of look out into 2018, seeing different geographies outperform others. And I think you pointed out more of the growth would come from the West and Southeast and probably slower in the Mid-America. First, can you talk about what's driving that shift? Number one. And number two, how does that come into play with your outlook for profitability? I mean, you touched on the fact that Mid-America is a higher profitability market for you guys. So just how do we think about that and how it plays in the incremental margins and so forth as we look into 2018?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. What I'll say, Trey, is, it's not so much a shift. It's a continuing trend that we've seen. So if we think about the last several years, clearly the western U.S. recovered more early or earlier than the eastern U.S. did. What we're seeing and we clearly saw it in the third quarter, for example, is we saw nice growth in the southeastern United States, so principally Georgia, Florida, those types of markets. I think as we look at the Mid-America Group, keep in mind, that covers a very broad swathe of the United States for us. So it's going as far west as places like Nebraska and it's coming clearly into the Mid-Atlantic. So what I would say are several things. One, our business in the Midwest, so let's call it Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, has been a perfectly solid business, but it's been a solid business during a couple of years, for example, when the agricultural market has been really hit hard. And what's very different about this time than it would have been, say, 15 years ago, if the ag economy had been down 15 years ago, we would not have seen the good steady business performance that we've seen over the last couple of years. So if we see that ag economy get some legs in the Midwest, I think that actually does a lot for that business. If we pause and look at what's going on in the Mideast, for example, Indiana, Ohio, parts of West Virginia, we're almost running at capacity in places like Indianapolis. So we're waiting to see what else can be done in that market. What's interesting to me is to see where the Carolinas are right now, because that's a marketplace that simply has not grown this year the way that we thought it would grow this year. And I think in many respects, it goes back to the type of dialog that I think we've all had over the last several months. And that is we've simply not seen the growth on the public side that we anticipated that we would see. I mean, Trey, if you and I were having this conversation a year ago, and I bet you that national highway construction activity would be down 4% nationally at this point of the year, my guess is not a lot of people would have taken that bet, because you would not have seen that. What we see in portions of Mid-America is a need to see public come to the party. And if public comes to the party, it's going to be an impressive show. We certainly did not see that this year. Now bidding activity in parts of the East Coast has ramped up here toward the end of the year. And that could certainly give a much better tailwind on that business going into next year. But frankly, a lot of people thought that's exactly what we would have seen this year. And remember what we've always said on incremental margins. We think on average you would see 60% is volume returned, but we've also said the two areas that really need to be hitting for that to work are Southeast and the Carolinas. And the Southeast is looking pretty good. The West, we believe, is looking pretty good. We believe the building blocks are there for the Carolinas to do exceptionally well. We thought that coming into this year as well. I think there's a lot that could tell us that there could be good momentum there next year. We thought we saw that coming into this year. So as we really frame our 2018 outlook, part of what we're being instructed by is what we've seen in 2017. Is that helpful, Trey?
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, Ward. Thank you. And kind of on that and some of the things that you talked about in the quarter. And labor constraints have been an issue for everybody and downstream in particular. And I believe you noted that your outlook for mid-single-digit aggregates volume growth really assumes that this – and maybe some of the other more macro headwinds, you noted, don't see a tremendous change there going into next year. Is that the right assumption there? And then, as you look into your individual markets, the customers you're talking to there, is there any potential to see any relief on the labor side, maybe as we get caught up in some of these storm markets, progressing into 2018? Or with volume improving, could we see continued or even further tightening on the labor side there in your opinion?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What's interesting to me is, there are a lot of contractors who have not gone back and hired in a substantial way since the last downturn. But here's what's odd. Wage inflation hasn't gone wild and rampant through the construction sector. So you're still seeing really relatively modest wage inflation, which tells me if contractors want to pick that pace up, particularly if work is coming out of DOTs more quickly, they can have in many respects the ability to do that from a financial perspective. I think part of what we're seeing, and I tried to allude to it in our prepared remarks, is contractors are reasonably busy today. And if you think about many contractors across the United States, in fact most of them, they tend to be private closely-held companies. So you and I watch every quarter, but most of our contractor clients don't. They're watching a year. And they're looking at their backlogs. And right now many of them have very attractive backlogs. They have full visibility into next year, some of them even beyond next year. And they're feeling very peaceful with that. I think much of it's going to hang on, what can DOTs do? As you would imagine, we have a pretty healthy dialog with a series of DOTs across the United States, and even in places where we've seen gas taxes and other things go up, where clearly there will be more revenue. One of the needs that I consistently hear from DOTs is, we need more people here to help us put this work out. So it comes back to the notion that we described coming into the year, the need is there. The money is going to be there. And what's odd to me, Trey, is we're still seeing infrastructure in our business below that five-year average. And the day is going to come that we're going to see that pop above the five-year average. And it may be next year. But I do think those are some of the issues that are in the way. I think if we see some things come out of tax reform, and I haven't looked at it, but I do understand that the Republican proposal has hit the street today. If there's some infrastructure funding that likely comes from tax reform, could that put DOTs and contractors in a different place? I think it probably could. And I think if you have contractors in a different place, you can clearly see more public work. That would be my quick take, maybe not so quick.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks a lot for that as always. And then last one for me, just to make sure I heard everything correctly. You kind of touched on some of the impacts that, at least from you guys, measurement on what the storms, the impact that could have on aggregate, cement and ready-mixed.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Aggregates, that was 2.1 million tons. If I heard you right, that was the impact there; and then cement was 400,000; ready-mixed was 300,000 yards. And I missed the last one. I'm sorry.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think we said asphalt and paving was probably 55.5 shifts versus 25 shifts in the prior year. So that was really – we were trying to do a product line on that. So that's the way we measure it, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. It's super helpful. And specifically, though, that's in the third quarter. That's not like an overall kind of impact even as we kind of maybe linger into 4Q a little bit or anything like that. That's specifically in the quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That was definitely in the quarter. And look, there will be some lingering effect. And you did say 40,000 tons of cement, didn't you, Trey?
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Correct. Yes.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. I just want to make sure you had that. Okay.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: That's it. Thank you very much for that, Ward. Thank you for taking my questions as well.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, hey. Good morning, guys. How is everyone?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We are great, Timna. I hope you are.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thanks. I know you offered 2018 volume color, and I didn't see anything on price and there may be a reason but I thought I'd ask anyway. If you could give us any thoughts on early pricing as your peer mentioned that momentum could be slowing a bit in some markets. Just want to get your take.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, look, I think if you look at the pricing performance that we put up today, I think the pricing performance that we reported is probably industry leading, right now. I haven't seen anybody else come out with the type of pricing that we have. Again, these are valuable products. They are diminishing resources. They are hard to replace. And we're focused on value in these markets. Timna, what you've heard me say for years, and I think this metric continues to work, if you've got really subdued aggregates volume growth, say, less than 5%, then I think you can look back to more historic price increases in that 3% to 5%. But I think, equally, if you have aggregate growth above 5%, suddenly the linkage between average selling price growth and aggregate growth gets to be much tighter, usually with a modest lag on the ASP percentage growth as compared to the tonnage growth. Now, clearly, we have outperformed that this year, and we've outperformed that over the last several years. So, I'll leave that to your judgment on how to look at that going forward. But I continue to believe that as we look at these products, the pricing story is not something that I see being broadly shaken. I think there has clearly been efforts in some markets because of depleted volumes this year when people have made some, what I would say, are fairly aggressive moves to pick up some volume. We've tried to be very disciplined in our market view.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. So that's kind of a good segue to the second part of my question, which is, as you mentioned, there's that – on 5% volume growth, give or take, big impact potentially on the pricing side, and yet your guidance is for mid-single-digits, which is exactly 5% if we get picky about it. So, can you just talk us through what are the main factors that we can watch that could help drive a 5%, 6%, 7% or 4%? Like within your guidance, what are the main things you're assuming, what could provide upside or downside in the major driving factors?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I would look at a couple of things. One, if housing continues to stay good, I think that's going to give you some upside in large part, because housing contractors typically aren't buying big volumes. So, oftentimes, they're coming in buying it at near list price inquiries, so housing clearly helps. The other thing that would help is, if you simply saw more infrastructure activity, because if you see more infrastructure activity, you're going to be selling more DOT specification stone, the more DOT specification stone that you're selling, it should simply have a higher ASP associated with it, particularly if there's more concrete and ready-mixed work because you're selling a higher spec stone, more volume and it simply ends up being in many respects a higher priced product. Now, the other fact that you have to take into account, Timna, is, where are you in the construction cycle, because that's not necessarily true if it's brand new construction and you're selling more base product. But I do think if we're looking at where we sit in this cycle, would still public not performing the way that people have expected it to, but still a great expectation for more to come. I think the more we see on public side, the better that is likely to be for average selling pricing, if you try to get a proxy for it going forward.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Let me ask it different way, because I understand that that makes sense but included in your mid-single-digit volume guidance, how much do you have, A, for repairs from storms, hurricanes embedded in that? How much do you have in any debottlenecking of kind of the public construction issues that you talked about?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what, we built in modest pieces of that over the next several years, Timna. And that may end up being conservative, here's one reason that I say that but it's hard to tell. And that is, we've never seen a city the size of Houston go through the type of rebuild that Houston is going to experience. If we go back over time and we look at what came behind Katrina or if we look at what came behind the storms in Denver five years ago, we're seeing the last of FEMA work from that storm in Denver five years ago, just being big and dealt with this year. My guess is, you may see a faster pace, but that's all it is, Timna, and we have not baked it. And you may see a faster pace of that in portions of Texas going forward. If that does happen, it could be helpful because keep in mind, we're dealing with the long haul market in Houston. So, you do have a fully ASP-laden transportation-loaded product that's going into that marketplace from our perspective. That's typically going in by rail. So, could you see more price that could come from that? You could. We have candidly not baked a lot of that in.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Jim, Suzanne, welcome. I'm wondering if you folks can just bridge for us the EBITDA guidance reduction. Midpoint to midpoint, it's about $128 million. It looks like about half to two-thirds is from lower volumes. Can you just help us flush out the remaining third and just rough buckets of costs? I'm assuming they're storm related, but can you just flush it out for us?
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Jerry, it's, Jim. So, a couple of things. I think the sort of storm impact is in isolated to Q3 there'll be some lingering effects in Q4. So, it's hard to put a fine line under those but that's definitely get part of what we think is going to happen in Q4 and in fact, with our full-year guidance. In addition to that, we've got the some of the one-time expenses that you need to recognize. We put into the third quarter, but those affected the full-year guidance, the $12 million for railcar expenses as an example. Those should take up most of it. And also, we've got a – frankly, an implied early start to winter in Q4 occurring. And so, that's what we're baked in at this point for full-year guidance. Does that get you what you need?
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful, Jim. And then maybe just explicitly, I know it's tough to isolate the specific stranded costs and logistics and efficiencies, but how much of that is within the guidance?
James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That's baked in the guidance. The way I think about that though is, if you think about what's the size of it in this year was – well, third quarter, our operations in Texas, Ward alluded to some of the reasons why the volumes were down there and the operating leverage, we lost as a result of that. I think the way to measure that would be look at Q3 of 2016, look at the gross profits in cement and ready-mixed in Q3 of 2016, compare that to the gross profit margins Q3 of 2017 and maybe not to that degree, but a lesser degree that some of that occurring in the Q4 as well. Okay? And then hopefully those effects are worked through by 2018. Those are not going to persist beyond Q4, but there's some of that in Q4 still, the loss operating leverage, again to a lesser degree that we saw in Q3 but some of that in Q4.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: In your 2018 guidance for volume, what are you expecting for public spending? And does that assume any of the logistical issues at the DOT front improve? And have you started seeing any of that fast money start kicking in some of these projects?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What we have started to see, what we believe is some evidence of that picking up here toward the end of this year. What I'll tell you very candidly, Phil, is, we're anticipating for better or for worse, and it's probably candidly somewhat conservative on our view that we're not going to see remarkable relief on that next year. And in large part, we're saying because we thought we were going to see it this year. And so, to the extent that you really see that breaking through in some meaningful ways next year, I think that would obviously be quite helpful to us. Is that responsive?
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: So just to be clear, in your guidance for 2018 for volumes, you're expecting limited growth on public spending or just the bottleneck not getting much better (44:29)?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We're expecting the bottlenecking to begin to break loose, and we're expecting clearly to see it get better next year. I guess what I would like to see is for it to break through in a more meaningful way than we're anticipating right now because we think that should have happened this year. So, we're clearly looking for growth in all three of our primary end uses next year. I'm still frustrated by the fact that infrastructure's 42% of what we're doing right now. It should be considerably higher than that. I would have thought it would have been higher than that coming into this year. There's no reason structurally, as we look at it, that it shouldn't be higher than that next year. But again, we would have thought that coming into this year. As I indicated in one of the earlier questions, we will see that breakthrough. The question will be exactly when, and, I think we're taking a very measured, appropriate view of that right now.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's a helpful color. And then your downstream business margins took a step back this year, some of that is related to these energy projects not being immediately replaced. So, if some of these bids are not going out until next year, should we see any lift in 2018? Or is that more of a 2019 event?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, I think you will see lift going into next year. We clearly expect a better ready-mixed year, next year, in Texas, in particular. Look, we've got the best looking work behind that business in Texas on ready-mixed that we've had at any point since we've owned that business. So, we talked a little bit about the fact that some of the issues that we've run into this year have been relative to weather, and some of the issues that we ran into this year were relative to the way that we were maintaining price leadership in that market as well. I don't see us giving that up per se, but I do see us doing better on the volume side and doing better in that business generally.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks a lot.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned that you're seeing an increase in bidding on the infrastructure in some markets, mainly in the east. I was wondering if you could remind us what the usual lag is between when a project is bid and when you start to see volumes shift to those infrastructure projects.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It can vary pretty considerably, Garik. It can be anywhere from two to six months oftentimes on those types of projects. So, it's going to depend on the nature of the project and exactly what it is, whether it's brand new construction overlays or otherwise. So, it's going to be measured, typically, I would say, within a – let's call it within a six-month timeframe.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And this is a more qualitative just around your visibility and infrastructure. And we appreciate your frustration with the lack of infrastructure demand in 2016. But is there any way to maybe qualify or if you can quantify your visibility on infrastructure into 2018 versus where you sat a year ago from this seat? How has that changed, and maybe your level of confidence as some of these bottlenecking initiatives will end up materialized?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Well, look, I guess several things. One is, we just look at DOTs across United States. I mean, clearly, for example, Texas DOT had a serious need to hire more people. They had a hiring freeze that they had in place for a fairly extended period of time this year. And here's what we see going into next year. Think of it in these terms. So, as we came in to the year, they had an expected letting schedule of $7.3 billion, and it ended up being about $6.2 billion. So, it was less than even they thought. As we look ahead, they're looking at $7.5 billion for next year. It's even increased $500 million since July, and the majority of that increase actually went to Fort Worth, and that includes $105 million of Prop 1 money. Here's what I think is notable, though, Garik. That doesn't include any Prop 7 money. So, if we're looking at Prop 7, what we're anticipating right now is $3.2 billion of that forecasted for 2019. And what's, I think, important is TxDOT itself was saying they're looking at about $2.3 billion worth of September 2018 dollars, in otherwise that'll be let in advance of the Prop 7 funding. So, if we're looking at simply where they are relative to jobs, they currently have nearly 200 job openings, and that's per the TxDOT website. The majority of the jobs posting are for engineers, transportation techs, design techs, et cetera. And here's what's fascinating. They had a job fair in Austin, and in the first 30 minutes, 50 people applied for the jobs. So what we're seeing in a state like Texas, which matters to us, you got a lot of people coming to work for TxDOT. You've got a lot more money coming to work there as well, so we feel good about that. In Colorado, which is an important state for us, several things. We see big, good, large projects that are set to commence there in 2018. The I-70 reconstruction around Denver Metro is going to be a big job. The I-25 widening in northern Colorado will equally be a big job. But notably, and this goes back to your commentary of what do we see going forward, new Senate Bill 17-267 allows Colorado to issue certificates of participation for about $1.8 billion in transportation projects over the next four years. So again if we're looking at those two states that in large part comprise our West Group, and that gives you a good sense of what the public side of it can look like. I mentioned earlier that North Carolina, we're seeing the pace of letting in this state improve. Here's part of what's notable though over the next several years, is South Carolina. And this is a stat that frankly I was unaware of until we were really looking hard. They manage the fourth highest number of highway miles in the United States in South Carolina. Now keep in mind, they've upped their gas tax, all of which is dedicated for transportation to increase $0.02 per annum for the next six years or $0.12. So in large part, you're going to see funding increase to annual DOT in South Carolina over the next several years by $800 million. These are big numbers. And that doesn't take into account what we've already discussed previously on House Bill 170 in Georgia and what that's doing in doubling their DOT investment. And Florida sitting at an over $10 billion letting schedule, which is near a record level. So as we look at what should be coming in those states, it should be pretty compelling.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: That color is very helpful. Lastly, you clearly chose value over volume on cement. Just wondering how to think about cement pricing into 2018 if you've announced increase in rate pool yet (51:25).
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What we have spoken previously about the prospect of a $12 a ton increase in that marketplace, we have seen others come out and announced a $6 in Texas. We've seen another $6 increase announced in Arkansas and Louisiana and an $8 in Oklahoma. So the fact is, we're going to have to meet that and that is what we will do. You've looked over time and you've seen the type of position that we have in that marketplace. And that's a position that we're going to protect in that marketplace. And we think we can do that in many respects and protect our price. And we think we can do that with premium service in a marketplace that is going to be incredibly vibrant over the next several years, particularly in North Texas.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just quickly, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Rob.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: You had mentioned obviously with the Mid-America segment being maybe a little less contributor in 2018. And then the fact obviously, we have some of these lingering issues with the hurricanes in terms of labor absorption as well as logistical challenges. I know you're not giving guidance yet for 2018, but would that imply that margins on the aggregate side could be – I won't say the word challenged, but it could be lower than what we've seen them historically.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I think it goes back to the conversation I was having with Trey a little while ago. I think the areas that are most impactful to the incrementals are what happens in the Southeast Group, and we anticipate that being better, and then really what happens in the Carolinas. And that is where we're waiting to see what happens relative to public work. What we have are good population trends in North and South Carolina. What we have are relatively good DOT programs in both North and South Carolina. And what we're waiting to see is, when we really start getting a kick from the public side in those two states in particular, because if we see that, it's going to be a very attractive show. But we would have expected a more attractive show from those this year. I mean, North Carolina's unemployment rate is 4.5%. So one of the challenges I'm sure DOT has here is finding qualified people to come to work for them. And if we look at DOT staffing in North Carolina over the last decade-ish, it's gone down by over 20%. So I think that has been a challenge for them. At the same time, the need is significant. And I can tell you they want to get that work out. But again back to your question, it's going to be disproportionally driven by Southeast, where we see very good growth, and then how much you anticipate growth being in that Mid-Atlantic portion of Mid-America.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just secondly, one of your competitors noted that one of the issues impacting their margins was the fact that if you look at the type of product that they're shipping right now, it is of a lower margin quality product. Are you seeing some of that in some of the markets you're serving?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? I think it can move around pretty considerably. So if there's early repair type work, yeah, I think that could certainly be it. If you're seeing brand new construction happen, you're selling base product that can have at least a lower ASP, not necessarily a lower margin. Clearly, the more we see good high quality, high spec public work come in, that will help the margin on the material going out. So to the extent that we've seen public across the United States come back more slowly this year than anticipated, I do think that's a very fair observation. Yes.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. And last question and I'll let you go. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion post the storms, and the size of the effort of the rebuilding that would have to take place, especially in areas like Houston, where obviously a number of homes were just demolished. I know we talked about obviously the problems that the storms created with logistics and things of that nature. But is there on the flip side an opportunity as that rebuilding starts occurring?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? I think the answer is yes. And here are some of the things that we're going to have to think about. Number one, what will the timing of federal funds really look like in those markets? What will insurance claims look like? How long will DoT integrity studies take for roads and highways? One thing that's important to remember on public work in particular, public work doesn't go away from a storm. It simply gets pushed out. So as we go through and look at what's likely to happen in a place like south Texas and Houston, as I indicated before, we've never had a storm of that duration go over and park on top of the fourth largest city in the United States before. And everything that we have to compare that to goes back to Katrina or Colorado or otherwise. And what I would say is, really it's unfair to compare what's likely to happen in Houston to what happened in New Orleans. I don't think we're looking for an X as (56:43) the people from Houston. I think from a human resource perspective and from a fiscal perspective, what Texas is going to be able to do and what Houston is going to be able to do is far different than anything we've seen in the past. But I think what we're doing right now is using our previous experience to help guide what we think the outlook is going to be. And again, if anything, we're probably going to be accused of being a bit conservative on that and we'll take that.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great. Thanks, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Ward, the last time that you had mid-single-digit volume growth or better was 2015 and the incremental margin in aggregates was 65%. And I guess, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're just telling us to be cautious and say, I know we're forecasting mid-single-digit volumes but don't go and plug in a mid-60% incremental margin because of mix.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I mean, I think we're just saying let's watch where the growth is going to be. And let's just measure that very carefully together as we go through it. As we've said, Adam, I think the southeast is going to look good. I think the West is going to look good. I think much of Mid-America can look good. We'll just wait and see some public pull through there so that's the general message, I think you're hearing.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then lastly just maybe a comment on your capital allocation priorities for 2018. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what, the capital allocation priorities really haven't changed. And we've been startlingly consistent on how those look. Look, we like the right transactions and that's exactly what we believe Bluegrass is. We're also going to invest in our business and make sure that we have a business that can really sustain itself and we're going to be focused on returning cash to shareholders. And if part of what we said is, we want to have a meaningful and sustainable dividend. And obviously, we took that dividend up earlier this year. We'll come back and revisit that again next year. But part of what we're going to be focused on for the rest of this year and obviously into next year, we'll be getting Bluegrass Materials done and integrating that business into ours.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. I made it under the wire here. Could you talk about cement just for a little bit? I wasn't sure how it plays out, so, you're holding price and someone else's and they're taking share. Do you just wait for them to reach capacity or how does it play out?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what, Craig, it's not always just a clear-cut game. You're watching very carefully what's going on in the market. You're watching individual customers and looking at their movement. You're looking at what you feel like others' inventories may be and otherwise. So it's not just a clear-cut, easy formula. We've got very capable people on the ground there in Texas that watch that business. And our strategy has candidly been very intentional in that marketplace.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: And so, I mean, but you're not going to come back on price? So I'm really just wondering, you're not giving me a scenario of how that turns around.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, it depends on how full others are, how much work is coming, how much we believe premium service matters in that marketplace. I don't see us going backward on price. I can see us being competitive on price. I don't see a backward march if that's what you're concerned about.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then it's early in Houston, but part of the solution and there's going to be a lot of dollars for it. It's likely to be another reservoir which you could use a lot of your product. Did you guys have competitive advantage in your ability to serve that market?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, keep in mind, one thing we did several years ago is we opened Medina Rock & Rail. And Medina Rock & Rail has a capacity put 10 million tons of stone on the ground, west of San Antonio and it's sitting on UP mainline and it's the largest quarry on the UP's vast network in the western United States. And we have the ability to move stone into a series of sales yards that surround Houston unlike anyone else. So, I'll just let those facts speak for themselves, but I think they add up, too. Yes.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then with the Bluegrass acquisition, it seems like it's playing with the DOJ pretty much like you expected. Were you expecting to make divestitures when you bought Bluegrass?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. What we said when we bought it is we weren't going to say the divestitures weren't possible, but we didn't see it like that. They would be material divestitures in the transaction and we feel exactly the same way today.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then in general, there's a lot of M&A activity within the industry right now, including competitive bids. Does that tell you anything about where we are on the cycle or why do you think it's all heating up at this point?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It was interesting. If we go back to February this year, we had the same question. And part of our observation at the time was we thought this would be a year in which you would probably see fairly significant M&A activity, and I think we were entirely right on that. Look, I think a lot of it's going to depend on who the sellers are and what type of business they have, where they are, if they're a private business in their families where they may be relative to succession. Look, I'm not going to kid myself what's happening with the tax code today. And over the next several weeks, it may drive some of that as well. Look, I think there could be fairly considerable M&A activity. I'm not necessarily predicting it's going to be next year. But I think as we look at this sector over the next three, four and five years, I think it could continue to be fairly robust relative to M&A activity. That wouldn't surprise me at all, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. This isn't generational sellers making a bet on the end of the cycle.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What I think, each family, if it's families selling businesses have their own unique drivers. And I think that's probably a question better put to them. So, I think there's some people who are probably looking and saying, you know what, it's just time, and that's more how I see this than anything else.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. All right. Thanks a lot guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. You gave a lot of color earlier on the pricing particularly in the West. Taking into account all of your comments on what looks like to be a lot of DOT funding that could be there in the Southeast part of the country in the coming years. I'm wondering if there's anything one in the quarter that you consider with pricing. And then as far as going forward, specifically, if I look at the Mid-America, it looks like it's the first quarter with a fixed handle on pricing year-on-year in about a decade. Is there anything in there and is there anything that suggests that this trend shouldn't continue? And likewise, in the Southeast you've been at over 10%. Now, you're close to 10%. Is there anything specifically in this quarter and is there any reason to think a trend like that shouldn't continue going forward?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: The Southeast is clearly a very healthy market right now. And part of what you're seeing there is the degree of price it clearly comes from the transfers that go into Florida by rail. What I would say is, remember Mid-America covers a lot of territory. What I would point out to you that it's actually probably helpful to some of your math, we actually did sell some more fill product to North Carolina this past quarter that basically is a remarkably low price product, it didn't displace any other aggregate use. But actually if we had normalized it for that fill, that would have taken overall pricing for us for the quarter in ags up to 6%. So, again, I think it's a remarkably market-by-market driven undertaking. And you heard the conversation I had with Timna earlier in the call about the way that I think we can just look at aggregate pricing generally. But again, I see those markets is good, long-term, steady growth markets and pricing has been attractive in those markets as well.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rohit Seth, but there's no company name given.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, there. Got a quick question for you. There's a big bulge in the Texas DOTs lettings in September and August and we saw cement shipments. You're pretty good in coming out of the USGS shipment numbers. I was curious, we're also seeing like the highway cost report that Texas DOT puts out that pricing has been coming down in many different metrics, not just the aggregates, but earthmoving and things of that nature. And then square that up with you mentioned you're holding a line on cement pricing. I'm just hoping you could help me figure out what's going on, the competitive dynamic there.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What I would say is Texas is going to be an attractive market for a long time and there's a great deal of work there. We haven't necessarily seen evidence of things coming down per se the way that you're discussing, Seth. But as we look at what we think, what we know, the letting schedule be and what the work in that state looks like right now and where pricing is in that state relative to a corporate average, again, my commentary goes back to what we said earlier in the call. I think Texas and I think North Texas in particular can be one of the most attractive heavy-side building material markets in the United States for the next 25 years. I see very few things including population trends, employment and otherwise that make me feel differently about that. I mean, if we're looking just through Texas generally, that North Texas to San Antonio I-35 corridor, all the fundamentals remain in place. Texas is ranked number one in employment growth for the trailing 12 months. Dallas is the second best metro in the nation on housing. Houston even with the move from considerably less multi-family to more single-family stood at 7; San Antonio is at 25; Austin is at 27. The unemployment rate is 4.5%, and it's still number one in single-family unit housing permits and that Prop 7 money hasn't hit yet. So again as we look at what's coming in Texas for an extended period of time, it looks pretty attractive to us.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then in Colorado Sterling Construction has mentioned something about the bidding activity being pretty robust over there. Do you have any comments on that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. I think Colorado is going to be attractive for a long time as well. It's got good employment growth, it's ranked 18th overall, it's clearly faster than the rest of the United States. Unemployment in Colorado is at 2.2%. We see two large TIFIA projects in that state. C-470 is under way; I-70 starts in 2018. Those two together equal about $1.7 billion in total investments. That separate instinct from the Colorado Springs 2C sales tax that was passed in November of 2015. And keep in mind, we talked about the certificates of participation earlier, that's an additional $1.8 billion in transport projects over the next four years. So, if we're looking at a state that has been at a good level that we anticipate staying at a good level for a period of time, Colorado is at the head of that list.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. That's all I have. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right. Thank you again for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings call. We remain confident in our long-term outlook. Our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan continues to provide a firm foundation to enhancing long-term shareholder value. And we look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results with you in February. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Q2 2017 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. In addition, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our website and in our SEC filings. As we announced in this morning's release, we achieved second quarter records for consolidated net sales, gross profit, earnings from operations and earnings per diluted share. These results demonstrate our team's ability to deliver strong financial performance, despite the impact of weather and other uncontrollable headwinds. Importantly, in the first half of 2017, our record performance included our team delivering the best total injury incident rate in our company's history, the product of our foundational focus on safety and operational excellence. During the second quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Bluegrass Materials Company, the largest privately-held, pure-play aggregates business in the United States. Those of you who have heard us talk very publicly about SOAR, an acronym for our strategic operating analysis and review process, were likely not surprised when you read the Bluegrass announcement. This acquisition directly aligns with our strategic growth plan and complements our existing pure-play aggregates positions in the eastern United States by adding 23 additional operations with more than 2 billion tons of high-quality reserves. Bluegrass' Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee operations complement Martin Marietta's existing southeastern footprint and expand our product offerings to new and existing customers. Bluegrass' Maryland facilities supply customers in the Baltimore, Frederick, Hagerstown, Maryland Eastern Shore Metropolitan areas, as well as Delaware and will serve as a valuable strategic platform for additional growth. Further, this transaction provides leading positions in Bowling Green and eastern Kentucky. Currently, aggregate shipments in all of these geographies are 20% to 30% below prior peak levels, but are expected to benefit from accelerating economic growth in the eastern United States. Bluegrass' strong earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA margins, talented workforce and dedication to safety aligned with those of our existing Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic operations, which should lead to a seamless successful integration. We will access the capital market to finance this transaction and are committed to returning to our target debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.5 times within 12 to 18 months following the transaction's closing, which we currently expect in the fourth quarter of 2017 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Bluegrass team to Martin Marietta. Now let's turn to the company's second quarter performance. We delivered the following record results: consolidated net sales of $996 million, consolidated gross profit of $274 million, earnings from operations of $213 million, EBITDA of $292 million, and earnings per diluted share of $2.25. Operating cash flow for the six months ended June 30 was $230 million, increasing 9% over the comparable prior-year period and exceeding the first half 2017 peak operating cash flow by more than $70 million. These second quarter records highlight our ability to drive both top and bottom line growth in a period of modest but steady expansion in construction activity as well as our ability to perform well, despite short-term basically weather-related challenges in our historically most profitable regions. With that, let's discuss the biggest drivers of our second quarter performance. We benefited from continued residential growth and expect further gains in both single and multi-family construction in most of our top metropolitan areas. As expected, we're seeing a higher share of more aggregates-intensive single-family construction. Non-residential volumes in the second quarter were led by light non-residential building, as we continue to anticipate the next phase of heavy energy sector activity to start in late 2017 and early 2018. Infrastructure was steady during the quarter, with weather related delays pushing back project timetables; importantly, new large scale infrastructure construction activity is the most sensitive to weather impacts due to stringent department of transpiration construction standards. Notwithstanding these delays, we remain resolute that state and local initiatives combined with the potential for future increases in federal funding would generate significantly higher demand as the nation begins to address decades of under investment and we anticipate, weather permitting, a busy second half of 2017. As we've discussed many times, inclement weather can have a meaningful impact on construction activity in any given quarter. That's why it makes sense to analyze our industry over durations longer than three months, such as a half, a full year or more. That's indeed how we model and operate our business and our outlook remains positive based on the demand needs of our customers. And while they too struggle with periods of unfavorable weather sporadically compounded by capacity constraints and tight labor markets, our customers are broadly upbeat about both their short- and medium-term outlooks. Further, slow, steady growth reinforces the durable recovery with signs of continued growth evident in the vast majority of Martin Marietta areas. The broad-based underlying strength of our building materials business is revealed by volume and pricing increases across all product lines. Aggregates product line shipments increased 2% despite the negative impact of weather and other uncontrollable headwinds. The West Group led the growth with 3.6% improvement driven by demand in Colorado and Central Texas. The Mid-America Group's volume improvement of 2% was hindered by record rainfall. The Southeast Group and Georgia in particular was most impacted by heavy precipitation leading to a volume decline of 3%. Atlanta's second quarter rainfall more than doubled in comparison with the prior year's quarter and was 64% above the 30-year average. Importantly, on days not impacted by precipitation, our shipments typically exceeded that district's three-year average. Our cement shipments increased 8% led by strength in the Dallas/Fort Worth region. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered an 11.5% increase in shipments inclusive of volumes from an acquired business. The asphalt product line benefited from continued vigorous demand in Colorado and delivered impressive volume growth of 16.5%. Our pricing growth includes an overall aggregates product line average selling price increase of nearly 4% with growth of 10.6% in our Southeast Group driven by strong Florida demand. The West Group and Mid-America Group delivered increases of 3.4% and 2.4% respectively. Notably, Mid-America Group pricing growth was reduced by 200 basis points through opportune sales of lower priced fill material in the quarter. The cement business, benefiting from improved market fundamentals, delivered a 5.2% increase in average selling price. Ready-mixed concrete pricing increased 1.4% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, primarily due to geographic mix and lower energy project activity. Our local prices generally increased in the mid-single digits in Texas. Finally, our asphalt product line reported a pricing gain of 11% for the quarter. Collectively, our Building Materials business generated a record second quarter gross profit of $250 million. Consistent with the net sales impact from significant rainfall, production costs were negatively affected as well with increased expenses required to return our facilities to normal, safe operating conditions. The significant precipitation experienced in the eastern United States throughout much of the quarter is illustrated on the weather maps on slide five. As mentioned, our historically most profitable regions including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, each endured near record levels of rainfall. Given anticipated robust second-half demand, we accelerated grading, performed equipment maintenance and repair, and increased production where possible. For the second quarter, the cement product line incurred $3.5 million of kiln maintenance costs. Overall, the Building Materials business achieved a gross margin of 26.8%, up 30 basis points and led by the Southeast Group which delivered a nearly 250-basis-point expansion over the prior-year quarter, driven by pricing growth and disciplined cost control in the face of terrible weather. The Magnesia Specialties business also delivered a record second quarter. Net sales of $65 million, an increase of nearly 10% compared with the prior quarter, reflects growth in both the chemicals and lime product lines. The business' gross margin of 36.6% benefited from higher steel utilization, partially offset by planned maintenance expenses that did not occur in the prior-year period. Disruptive weather, while uncontrollable, is typically a short-term impact and does not normally alter overall market demand. We remain optimistic in the strong multiyear outlook for the construction sector generally and Martin Marietta specifically. This optimism is fueled by the strength and sustainability of job growth in our key metropolitan areas, an important catalyst for construction activity in all major end uses: residential, non-residential and infrastructure. Texas ranked first, Florida third, Georgia fifth, North Carolina eighth, and Colorado ninth in overall job growth for the trailing 12 months ended May 2017. Importantly, employment growth in most of these key geographies is accelerating faster than the United States average. Overall, the United States added 2.2 million jobs during the trailing 12 months, and positive employment data for our top states further solidifies our outlook for the second half of 2017 and beyond. As noted earlier, private construction activity led our growth for the second quarter. The residential market, which accounted for 20% of our second quarter aggregates product line shipments, is benefiting from continued economic recovery, particularly in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, and Iowa, which are all ranked in the top 10 states for total housing permits, and indicate our future demand. We're also encouraged by increasing levels of single-family housing permits, with Dallas, Tampa, Austin, Atlanta, Orlando, Charlotte, Houston, and Raleigh comprising the top eight performers nationally. Yet national housing starts remain below the 50-year historical average of 1.5 million per annum. By its nature, single-family housing and related subdivision development activity are considerably more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction. While some national multi-family trends are mixed, we see solid multi-family activity in many of our top metropolitan areas and anticipate further growth. We continue to observe encouraging trends in non-residential construction demand. North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Colorado are benefiting from positive private sector activity, including large corporate relocations and healthy residential construction. Additionally, the June 2017 Dodge Momentum Index reading of 141.1, near its highest level since 2009 and steadily increasing since mid-2016, signals further non-residential growth with a strong commercial building outlook. Turning to infrastructure, weather-induced project delays combined with labor shortages translated into flat volumes in the second quarter. We anticipate volume gains in the second half of the year, as our customers have indicated solid backlogs and the desire to make progress on delayed jobs. We remain steadfast in our belief that the benefits of federal, state, and local funding increases, including those in the $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act, will have positive impacts on infrastructure construction activity in the second half of the year and beyond. Critically important examples of these state and local led initiatives include the record Florida Department of Transportation current year budget of nearly $11 billion; the emerging impact of Georgia State House Bill 170, which is expected to double its state-level transportation construction investment; the Colorado Springs local 2C sales tax initiatives, which adds tens of millions of dollars of infrastructure investment in that community; and gas tax increases in Iowa, South Carolina, and Indiana. As we look forward to the remainder of 2017 and beyond, we see our most profitable outlook ever underpinned by employment gains in our top markets. We expect increased levels of construction activity across our three primary end uses, which is consistent with third-party forecasters. Notably, Dodge Data and Analytics and the Portland Cement Association or PCA, both forecast growth in construction starts for 2017 and the next several years. These positive trends support our confidence in the ongoing multi-year construction recovery. As a reminder, the 2017 guidance we provided in February and reaffirmed today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment, nor does it include any benefits gained from actions taken to reduce businesses' regulatory burden. That said, I would be remiss if I did not underscore that we need weather to cooperate in the second half of 2017. We said coming into the year, as we always do, that we plan for weather to be normal – not great, just normal. But the second quarter was wetter than normal in many of our key markets. Thus to meet our guidance, weather must be better than normal for the rest of the year: drier in the near term and warmer as the construction season concludes. Additionally, as public pressure builds on elected officials to move legislation forward, construction activity will benefit, most notably through tax reform and a federal infrastructure improvement package, but also from reduced uncertainty. We remain encouraged by the bipartisan support in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure. In fact, just last month, 206 House members signed a letter from the Graves-Norton Subcommittee on Highways and Transit to both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Committee. These congressional signatories expressed their support for a permanent highway trust fund fix. In the near term however, we believe regulatory relief will benefit the pace of highway construction activity. The ability for states to bring projects forward and expedite large project approvals should generate increased product demand in both the near and long term. Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation to enhance shareholder value. The company's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and include the right value-enhancing acquisitions that enable the successful execution of the company's strategic growth plan, organic capital investment, and the return of cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and share repurchases. In line with these capital allocation priorities and in addition to announcing the Bluegrass acquisition, we invested $216 million of organic capital in our business during the first six months of 2017. Since the February 2015 announcement of our share repurchase program, we've returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Currently, we have 14.6 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2017 was 1.8 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant. In summary, and as a reminder, in 2017, we expect aggregate's product line infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid-single digits. Non-residential volumes are expected to increase in the low- to mid-single digits. Residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid- to high-single digits, and ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be stable. Excluding any impact from the Bluegrass acquisition, on a consolidated basis, we expect a record year, with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion, a further expansion of gross profit and increased EBITDA ranging from $1.50 billion to $1.130 billion. Additionally in today's release, we increased the low end of our capital expenditures guidance to a range of $450 million to $500 million, as we anticipate the acceleration of certain capital projects to further prepare our operations for increased customer demand. In conclusion, we're proud of our record second quarter results and the ability of our team to manage through short-term disruptions while remaining focused on safety, and the long-term growth of our business. Our leading positions in many of the nation's fastest growing, most vibrant markets reinforces our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to capitalize on the durable, multi-year construction recovery, and benefit from the expected increased demand throughout 2017 and beyond. With the relentless focus on world-class safety standards, diligent cost discipline and operational excellence, we remain committed to achieving industry-leading results and further enhancing long-term shareholder value. This call began with the familiar refrain to every Martin Marietta earnings teleconference for over a decade by introducing Anne Lloyd. As you all know, Anne, will retire from our company this month. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Ann for her innumerable contributions to Martin Marietta. Anne has played an integral role in the growth of this company, always maintained a relentless focus on accountability and in so doing, has helped to deliver exceptional returns to our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Martin Marietta team, we wish Anne only the best in all things as she begins her next chapter in life. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Thank you for taking my questions today. Before I launch into questions, I just want to echo, Anne, Ward's comments, It's been a pleasure working with you these many years and we will miss you on the calls and working with you day-to-day and best of luck in retirement. We are all jealous.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Now on to the boring stuff, or not so boring stuff which is the quarter. You had discussed in Q1, some of the increases in personnel cost as you prepared for a big volume year. I guess two-part question. First, let's focus on volumes, help walk through the volume flow-through intra-quarter and how – what came, what happened and where perhaps there were shortfalls in volumes. And then the second part of the question, touching on the personnel, how much of the shortfall in volumes in the quarter coupled with higher personnel cost impacted margins? And if there's any other drivers to impact margins in the quarter, it would be helpful for additional color there. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Kathryn, good morning, and thank you for that. I'll address those both in order. So, if we think about the volume flow for the quarter, Kathryn, the most important thing to remember is we had fairly significant portions of our footprint that really experienced almost two-thirds of the quarter with heavy rain. And what I mean by that is principally the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic. So when we have Georgia and Florida and North Carolina and South Carolina and portions of Virginia feeling disproportionate weather, it does affect our business. It affects our businesses from a customer perspective. It affects our businesses from an operating efficiency perspective. So the way that I would encourage you to think about it is really it's that portion of the business that felt it disproportionally. There was some sense of that in the Midwest as well. Not as much in the Rocky Mountains, not as much in Texas, but really I would look at the Mid-America Group and I would look at the Southeast Group principally and I would say that they were ones who felt the volume flow most precipitously, no pun intended. I mean, if I'm looking at volume for the quarter and we look, just as an example, at our North Georgia district, and when we say that, what I really mean is Atlanta. It was off 20% on volume. Anybody who's been to Atlanta over the last several years knows, looking at that marketplace, that's not a place from raw construction activity that feels like it's 20% off and it's not going to be. It was cloudy. Same issue in a place like Charlotte. The Charlotte district saw volumes down 14%. So when we're talking about cities like Charlotte and Atlanta that are seeing those types of double-digit volumes down, it does affect the way the volume comes and the way the profits flow. So, if we think about shipments, at least what we could plan for the second quarter, we have planned for over 46 million tons in the second quarter. Actual shipments obviously are just modestly over 43 million tons, so you're 6% below plan. Where you were below plan matters. If we look at our planned production costs, what's remarkable is they were broadly on plan. We were 0.5% above plan on production costs, but here's part of – back to your point, Kathryn. We did add some personnel in these places where, listening to our customers, we feel like we're going to have a very busy second half of 2017, most likely a very busy 2018. And people candidly are having a hard time understanding why they're not going to have a good 2019. So we had gone into these areas that we saw growth and we had added an hourly workforce. If we go back and take a look at what that would've meant, here's what it means, practically speaking: on days that the sun is shining, we're staffed just right. On days when it's raining, we're a little bit heavy on head count in some of these areas. The fact is, if we look at where that was compared to last year, it's probably about $0.10 a share delta, simply driven by the lower volume and the lack of absorption. If we were looking at what we thought the quarter was going to be from a planned shipment perspective that we believe didn't happen because of rain, we would've been looking at about a 70% incremental margin on our stone business in the United States. So, I think that gives you the bridge that you were looking for, Kathryn, on talking about volume flow in the quarter and relative to personnel.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: That's helpful. Are there any other factors such as inflation, which has been a big theme this quarter, that impacted margins meaningfully?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, inflation really has not been a big driver for us. One thing that did have a modest margin impact, and we'll have to see how that plays going forward, is what's happening with some degrees of transportation in the southeastern U.S. CSX Railroad has – they're finding their way right now. They're clearly going through a model change, moving from unit trains to manifest trains. Their new CEO in fact sent out a communication to customers yesterday and while there's outlining that they have had some issue meeting customer demand up and down their lines, and we did experience some of that going into Florida and some other places as well. So we would've had some of that, Kathryn. But aside from the volume issue which was the primary noise in the quarter, the rest of it's, candidly, a pretty clean quarter.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay, great. On the Bluegrass, just a couple of cleanup questions. I know that you had had in your prepared commentary that the low end of CapEx guidance was primarily driven by the acceleration of capital projects to meet customer demand. To what extent do you anticipate having to spend additional CapEx or just basic capital for Bluegrass, or do you feel pretty good as they're integrated into the system late this year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. Number one, we don't anticipate any CapEx going into Bluegrass this year. We anticipate really bringing it into the company in Q4. So, we'll go through a planning cycle on that really for next year. In our due diligence on the organization, we looked very carefully at what we believed their CapEx requirements would be. We believe those assets have been very well run. We believe they were well invested and frankly, we looked at their assets from a CapEx perspective and viewed them very similar to ours in the eastern United States. So we don't believe that you will see a disproportionate spike in CapEx as we bring Bluegrass into the fold.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Kathryn, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Ward and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Trey.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Anne, and yeah, I want to echo what Kathryn said too on the retirement, Anne. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. Wish you the best and you're going to definitely be missed.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And then I guess, I want to kind of touch on a few things and Ward, you mentioned earlier, I think you even touched on briefly your customers and their backlog and kind of at least directionally what they're seeing out there. But reiterating that guidance after a pretty choppy first half, mostly as you mentioned due to weather, it's obviously implies a pretty aggressive ramp in the back half. If you could give us maybe a little bit more color on what you're seeing out there that gives you the confidence for the back half.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know, Trey, I think you hit it, and that is, we've spent a lot of time – I have this year and the first half of the year, talking to customers where they are and I've been in an enormous amount of our geography this year. It's more than a dialogue just with our Division Presidents and VP of Operations and Sales. These are operations very directly with customers talking about, and I said it in my prepared remarks, their near-term and medium-term outlooks. And by that what I would say is the typical dialogue I'm hearing from customers is, we have a backlog unlike a backlog we've ever had before. We will go into next year with a backlog that we haven't really seen before going into next year. That ties back into some of the commentary that I've had earlier and I think I mentioned on the previous answer as well. I think mentioned on the previous answer as well, 2017, to customers looks to be very busy as does 2018 and they're having a hard time understanding why 2019 shouldn't be. Now, you raise a fair point Trey, and that is if first half was wetter than usual, part of what I said in the prepared remarks was, half two needs to be A, drier than usual and the season needs to last a little bit longer than normal. And you've followed our business long enough to see, Trey, there've been some fourth quarters in particular where we have really been able to put up some impressive volume and profitability numbers if an October and a November go particularly well. So, looking at the back half of the year does the weather have to be good? Yes. Does winter have to be pushed off just modestly? Yes, it does. If we have normal weather for the rest of the year, could that put some degree of volumes pressure on the rest of the year? I think it probably could. I think candidly the EBITDA picture that we're seeing right now actually looks pretty strong. I think we're really resolute about that. At the end of the day, this is about keeping people safe, taking care of shareholders, and making money. And I think that's exactly what we're going to be able to do for the rest of the year. The primary thing that we need is we just need some good weather and we need to be able to let this business run.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. That makes sense. Also, you mentioned – you have mentioned before kind of hiring up in preparation for demand, which makes sense. But you also said that labor shortages in, I think kind of through the channel has played a role or was a factor, at least on the infrastructure side of things year-to-date as well. And when we talk to folks in the channel, it seems like that's one kind of recurring complaint is labor. Obviously nothing new, but with the funding picture improving and the demand picture improving, obviously there's a lot of pent up demand, there's funding that's coming through, lot of things are clicking. But do you think that the tight labor picture downstream really across the board from ready-mixed drivers to paving crews, do you think that that issue – or I guess I should ask it this way. How does that labor issue in heavy construction play into your longer term thinking for the recovery?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's more of a customer issue than it's going to be a Martin Marietta issue. I think that's the way to begin the conversation. I mean, here's the issue. Number one, it's longer term. Number two, if we look at what's going on on unemployment changes from Q1 of this year, I mean Texas itself is at 4.6% unemployment from 5%. Georgia's at 4.8%, down from 5.1%. Indiana's at 3%, down from 3.9%. Tennessee's at 3.6%, down from 5.1% and Alabama's at 4.6% from 5.8%. What that tells us is number one, there's great job creation, which is going to help underlying construction. Will it create some tightness in some places on getting qualified people who want to work in downstream positions? I think that's probably true. Are we seeing that on occasion in some places relative to ready-mixed drivers? Yeah, we have. At the same time, what I'd say Trey, in many respects, that's going to end up being a high-class worry because I think those high-class worries will likely drive continued construction in these marketplaces. I think some of this goes back to the dialog too that we're having with our contractor customers right now, because I think they're more willing to hire now than they have been. The other thing that I see from contractors is they're more willing to invest in capacity today. And part of what we see in our business, and I'm sure what they're seeing too, is technology is being their friend. So part of what we've been able to do new plants that we've put up for example is we're watching our tons produced per working man hour go up pretty considerably, even when we may not be adding heads to those specific operations. So, is it going to be something to watch? Yes. I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, I did. Do we see it as a significant stumbling block as we go through 2017, 2018, and 2019? Not significant. Will we talk about it on occasion? Probably so because our contractor clients will as well.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right, well that all make sense, and I appreciate the color on that, Ward, and thank you and that's it for me. I'll pass it on.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right, Trey. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Anne, let me add my congratulations. We'll miss working with you. Thank you for all of your help over the years and the tremendous performance over your tenure. So thank you.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You're welcome, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if we can talk about the M&A pipeline from here. How are you folks evaluating opportunities, and at which point in the cycle, Ward, would you draw the line and say, okay, we're at the late stages of the cycle and going forward, it'll be more bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to larger scale M&A?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well. I guess a couple of things, Jerry. Always think about what we've said relative to capital allocation, because the way that we look at that hasn't changed. So the right acquisitions and then looking at organic investment and then looking at return of cash to shareholders. We've been very consistent with that for a while. As you may recall, I think on the last earnings call, one of the things that I said was I thought this might be a year of large transactions. And as we sit here at a little past half year, and you look at the transactions that have at least been announced in our space, you've got nicely over $2 billion worth of transactions that have occurred. Now, that said, one of the things that we're sensitive to as well is we look at our debt to EBITDA ratio, we've said where we want to be over a period of time. Obviously, if transactions come forward, we're going to look at transactions. We're also committed to maintaining a healthy and appropriate balance sheet as we go through this period in the cycle. As to the other part of your question on where are we in this cycle right now, keep in mind, it's an odd cycle because at the last peak, we at Martin Marietta produced and sold 205 million tons, and at the bottom we were at 125 million. Last year, even with the volume that we had brought in from TXI, we were about 156 million. So, looking at where we are in the cycle from a tonnage perspective, it's still relatively early. We see continued growth in housing, and housing's still not back to a 50-year average. Based on what we're seeing in non-residential, light non-residential's going to be very good for the rest of this year. We think it's going to be healthy into next. But we also think the heavy portion of non-res is likely to get healthier for us next year. And then the other thing that's destined to happen, Jerry, is with the state-level initiatives that have been underway, in our largest states, and if we look at them by revenue, and we'd say number one is Texas, number two is Colorado, number three is North Carolina, number four is the combination of Georgia/Florida, number five is Iowa, number six is Indiana. If we look at those states and say that's over 70% of our revenue, it's hard to look at where we are in the cycle from a tonnage perspective, to see where we are from a FAST Act perspective, to see where we are from a state initiatives perspective, to see where we are from a residential perspective, and then to measure where we are in non-res and feel like we're anywhere late in this cycle. So do I think there will be more M&A? I think there will be. Do I think there'll be more large deals this year? If I'm speculating right now, I would say probably not. I think the year has seen that. Do I think people will be broadly more focused on bolt-on activity for a period of time? I think probably so. Will we be focused on integration over the next X months? You bet. Will we thoughtfully consider transactions that we feel like fit Martin Marietta well and meet the needs of our long-term shareholders? Of course we will. But right now we're awfully focused on, A, finishing this transaction with Bluegrass and making sure we're in a position to integrate it in the most thoughtful way, the same way that we did with TXI.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, Ward. And on permitting, you've been very vocal on the need to drive permitting times down. I'm wondering based on the task force that was set up, are you seeing the executive branch moving fast enough in that direction, and what needs to happen at the executive branch level to really drive permitting times down? And I guess are you hearing that we're moving in that direction from your folks in D.C.?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's certainly getting a lot better. I mean, the reform issues that we're most focused on is reduced project delays, reduced project costs, and less opportunities for frivolous litigation. And I think if we can get those, we'll see some serious progress that'll be made. It was interesting, I was reading The Wall Street Journal last week, and it was giving an update really on what they were seeing from their view on regulatory actions, at least by this White House and the OMB, what their budget contained. This was interesting, Jerry; a little over 1,700 preliminary proposed refiner rules. And you say that number at first glance and you go, well, 1,700 feels like a lot until you realize that was down 40% from its peak under the prior administration and a 17-year low. So in many respects, what we're seeing right now are reversals of earlier rules, and we saw 66 of those completed at the U.S. EPA, and a third of them were withdrawals. So from that perspective, Jerry, it's interesting to look at where we aren't on healthcare today. It's interesting to see where we're not yet on tax reform, although that seems to be next. And then you would assume infrastructure is next, but I do believe what the administration has done from a regulatory perspective has actually been helpful and has been somewhat unheralded.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Very interesting. And, Ward, on a short-term standpoint, you've always characterized the businesses as an outdoor sport, and obviously we had weather in the second quarter. Can you talk about how much visibility you have on the high-single digit volume growth that we need to see in the back half to hit the full-year guidance, I guess? Did we start the third quarter on the right foot in that direction?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, obviously, what I've tried to talk to, Jerry, is what we hear from our customers right now. And I think the other thing that's worthy of note, I did read the comments from some of our European friends who I know outlined that they anticipate a very busy back half of the year. I think that's what we anticipate as well. As I said, two things need to happen. We need dry weather, and we need a late winter. And based on everything that our customers are saying, we can be and they will be very busy if those two things happen.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Hey, good morning guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Timna.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: We also want to echo the comments wishing Anne all the best and thanking her for all the help over the years.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Timna.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sure. So wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance if I could. We were interested to see that you kept full-year guidance despite the weather which you've addressed. But if you look at some of the items like SG&A and other components, it would appear that some of the costs are also going to fall off in the second half. We just wanted to make sure that we understood what might be driving that.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well. I think, one thing, if you're looking at SG&A, part of what we're doing this year on SG&A is accruing at a level that you saw us accrue up to toward the end of last year. So in large part, that just evens itself out over the year. The other thing that I would come back and specifically address is we have added hourly head count as we discussed earlier in the call. If we get the volume pull-through that we anticipate, again, if we had had the volume in Q2 that we had anticipated, we would've had 70% incrementals in our aggregates business. So, from a cost perspective, again, if I'm looking at planned production costs for the quarter, they were exactly where we thought that they would be. Volume was down. I think I know exactly why volume was down. I think we understand very much what's going on relative to SG&A as I just outlined for you. So, from a cost perspective, and when you come back and measure in the fact that we have tried to do a good bit of stripping or grading in the early part of the year and some maintenance and repair, costs in the back half of the year should tend to be our friend.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that detail. We were also wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how to think about CapEx going forward given that as you pointed out, you think we've still got extended runway ahead of us. What we're running at utilization wise, and what is the kind of CapEx that we should think about, maybe into the future years relative to what you've said through 2017?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? Clearly, we've taken CapEx up here in the near-term. But we've taken CapEx up here in the near-term really relative to two very specific items. One, we feel like and believe that we have the ability to do some generational land purchases, at some very specific locations that we think are important to the long-term of our business, and we're focused on that. The other thing that we've done is we have accelerated some work in the Rocky Mountains on a sales yard that we're trying to finalize that's going in in northern Colorado up near Fort Collins. So, here the near-term, those are the issues that we're looking at. I think over the long-term, we've really not changed the view that we would've offered to you earlier in the year. We're probably looking at a standard run rate of $350 million to up. Let's call it $350 million to $450 million through this cycle. And we don't think that that's a bad place to be given what we believe the volume trajectory is likely to be if we continue to see infrastructure non-res and res move in positive directions. Keep in mind, part of what the industry did, and we were no exception, although I don't think we cut as much as others. The industry did pull back on CapEx during the downturn. And typically what you would see in a normalized time is companies spending on CapEx numbers roughly equivalent to DD&A, and we got below DD&A in the down cycle. Others got even farther below that than we did. I think you will see most responsible companies spending CapEx above DD&A right now to make sure that they can run with effectiveness and meet customer needs. So I think that's responsive, Timna. Did I hit your question?
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Except for the part about, that a snuck in on the utilization, if you wouldn't mind updating us on where you are there please.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? What we're really looking for now is great efficiencies on the organic CapEx that we're putting in. From a utilization perspective, back to the comment that I made before, at peak, before we had acquired TXI, we produced and sold 205 million tons of stone. Now what I tell you back in 2006 when we were doing that, we were pushed pretty hard and were we in a position that we were bringing in temporary crushing equipment? Yeah we were. What I would tell you is based on the assets that we have really prior to TXI, 190 million tons is probably a good solid run area for us. We added 15 million tons with TXI. That's going to take you very, very nicely up to that 205 million tons number before, then obviously we're coming in with this tonnage from Bluegrass. So, from a capacity perspective, we've got room to run, and as I outlined in my prepared commentary, the marketplaces that Bluegrass operates in are still 20% to 30% below where they were at peak. So, had a meeting earlier this week with a very specific Department of Transportation and one of the issues that this specific DOT referenced is, what we've done some things over the last few years to amp up our ability to invest more in transportation. We want to make sure that you can be there for us. And I said whatever you're worrying list is, don't have our ability to run at higher volume levels as one of the high items of worry on your list. We can do that.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That makes sense. Okay. Thanks again.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is now open.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and same things, Anne. Congrats on your retirement. I want to start off and ask about the back half of the year, possibly in a different way. You talked about the confidence you're getting in the volume growth. And if we look at the guidance, it seems like you'll need some pretty impressive incremental margins to get there, which would obviously include a lot of pricing. And we're seeing that strong pricing in the Southeast. Possibly some of your other regions, pricing is a little lower. So I just wanted to see how we can get some conviction that we're going to seek pricing in Mid-America and West accelerate a bit in the back half of the year so we can get those strong incremental margins.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. Here's something, Scott, that I think's actually a really important point to bring out in more detail, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks as well. We did have some sales of fill material in basically North Carolina on one job that made our AST look actually considerably lower than it was. Keep in mind the fill material that we sold was really a waste product that we were selling to contractors on a bypass job in eastern North Carolina where they had run into unsuitable soils. So, what was happening here is it was a waste product, we needed to get it out of our way and they needed it for unsuitable soils. That all by itself took the ASP down almost artificially. So, ex that fill product, we were at about 4.7% up in the Mid-Atlantic division, that really is North Carolina. And if we look at June ASPs for that division all by itself, it was at 5.1% ASP up. So again, if we're looking at what I think will be tight supply later in the year in the Rockies in the West, what I think will be a very busy year in Texas, particularly in the north, when you look at good pricing in the Southeast at double digits and when you look at what's normalized in Mid-Atlantic now at about 5.1, I think that gives you a much better feel for accuracy on pricing, Scott. Is that responsive?
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, I wanted to follow up on the comment you made on the customers talking about their massive backlogs that they were having. Did you get any sense from those backlogs? Are those growing more on the private side or the public side?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know, what I think the short answer is, yes. I think they're seeing good growth across the spectrum right now. Part of what I was encouraged by is, for example, on that bypass job in eastern North Carolina, somebody had asked a question earlier and they said, if you're selling fill material like that, isn't that more required on new construction? And the answer is, yes it is. And the fact is that's good new public works. I think contractors are seeing more opportunities to bid on that. I equally believe in the markets that we serve, private work continues to be good. I mean we're clearly seeing a shift toward more single-family as opposed to multi-family. But multi-family in our markets still is a very healthy underlying market. The other bidding that we're seeing a lot of activity on will be that next phase of large energy projects in South Texas and in the Gulf. So again, I think as the FAST Act continues to mature, as state initiatives continue to move forward, and in our markets where private work continues to expand, yes, they're seeing both public and private activity get better, Scott.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And one more, just wanted to ask quickly on the ready-mixed pricing. Just if you could talk about some of your conditions in Texas and Colorado, it looks like it was a little softer also this quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I guess a couple of things. One, what we saw in Texas was entirety what we expected in Texas. So if you think back to the guidance that we gave on that business, we said that a lot of that high-margin, high-price work that we had had last year driven by some of those large LNG projects in the Gulf would be going through a trough period this year. So not to expect as much relative to geographic mix and raw profitability in the downstream. What I did say in my prepared remarks is the type of pricing that we're broadly seeing in Texas right now is around that 5%, and again if we look at ready-mixed pricing in Colorado, I won't go into specific numbers there, but let's just say it's one of our better priced ready-mixed markets today.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate you taking my questions.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right. Take care, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. One quick question. So you're couple months into process of Bluegrass. Are you guys hearing anything different from the regulators as it might relate to any divestitures, anything like that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? As you recall, Stanley, we went through obviously what we thought was a very thoughtful process on that. And I think our team does analytics around that very, very well. We don't see any material divestitures coming out of that that we think will be value destructive to that transaction. We have the same conviction around that transaction today that we had on the day that we discussed it. We have filed Hart-Scott and we're working our way, what I would suggest to you, in a very orderly, very workman like, very Martin Marietta way through the process. So today, Stanley, no surprises, and we have a high degree of confidence that what we've outlined to you previously is still where we are.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. And then, how do we think about kind of capital structure post the deal? What are you thinking about in terms of duration or rate? Anything to help us, especially with the appetite for your type of credit in the marketplace being so good right now.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, yeah. Stanley, as we talked about when we announced the deal, we'll be financing this in the public marketplace. Our view is that we've got a long asset and there is a pull or a need for investment in 30-year notes out in the marketplace, and we think that that would be an attractive feature. We want to balance that with the ability to have some pre-payable debt with the full intent of de-levering the business within 12 months to 18 months post acquisition. That would basically have us doing probably some 2, 7, 10 and – maybe 2, 7 and 30-year notes. We think that an average rate there will be just shy of 4%.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. And then, Ward, last one for me. You had mentioned some discussions around finding a permanent solution for the highway trust fund. I mean, do you think that there's enough of an appetite for that? Is that something we could reasonably expect in the near future?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? It's fascinating to me because I've been at several meetings with administration members, members of Congress and others. And what they're all saying right now is, there are no options that are off the table. And I've heard among other people the Treasury Secretary say that as well. So I think people are going to look at this in a eyes wide open fashion because I do think there's a general understanding that the investment is needed. And two, it does create very nice long-term middle class jobs. So I think you're going to see a fairly significant and I think healthy debate on this. I think part of what helps, frankly, they have to do something. I mean, they literally – healthcare has not worked. Everybody needs a victory right now. It's fascinating. Go back if you can and take a look at a letter that Tom Donohue wrote in an open letter to the members of Congress here last week. And he outlined to them very clearly what they were looking for. They at the U.S. Chamber are looking for people who will underscore and help promote growth in the United States and people who are interested in governing. And he made it very clear that when the U.S. Chamber for example is coming back and taking score of who they're going to support or who they're not going to support in this next election, they're going to look at those two things. And he closed the letter with the words, members of Congress be warned, failure is not an option. So, part of what I outlined in the prepared remarks is as we watch people move toward a higher degree of necessary governance, I believe our sense is this is part of the necessary governance.
Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no. That sounds good. Well, thank you guys very much. Best of luck through the rest of the year. And Anne, best wishes to you. You certainly will be missed. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: See you, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Good morning or now afternoon. But again, I'd like to congratulate Anne on a great run and good luck in your future endeavors.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Rob.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Just real quickly, most of my questions have been answered. But, Ward, I guess previously you've discussed some stone shortages in certain markets. Could you kind of discuss what geographies that we're seeing in that in? And then secondly, obviously this is the second quarter where we saw a continued acceleration in obviously spending related to preparing for increased demand in the back half of the year. Has that program basically run its course, or should we expect to see more of that in the second half of the year? Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I guess a couple of things, Rob. As we were talking about places that we thought you might have the potential for spot shortages, when we discussed on the last call, I think specifically we called out portions of the Rocky Mountains, portions of the Midwest, and some portions of the Carolinas. So I guess what I would say at this point, I still think you could see that in portions of the Rockies. The Midwest got hit with some rain. So part of the question is going to be how far ahead of inventories can they stay right now? My guess is after Q2, I'm not as concerned about tightness in that market as I would've been when we were having the call back in February. And I equally would say to you one of the markets that I think we expected to be the busiest this year in North Carolina would've been Charlotte. And I think part of what I was outlining when I was going through my prepared remarks is when you're looking at a market like Charlotte, it was down on volume 14% in the second quarter. I think that probably gives them some comfort there, Rob. So I do think there can be some tightness in some markets this year. I don't think as many as we thought earlier, simply because of what we weathered with the weather, no pun intended. I do believe, to the next part of your question, that we have gotten ahead of what we think will be a very busy year for the rest of 2017 and 2018. So I don't anticipate significant more costs. Part of what we're sensitive to, and you've heard us speak to it in tight labor markets, one of the real challenges is making sure you're getting the quality labor that you want, who come to your company with the values that matter, and we're in a position to train them to operate safely. And we believe that's exactly what we've done with what we have in place today.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Perfect. Thanks so much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hi, Ward and Anne. Congratulations to you, Anne.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Ward, I just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to say about the back half of the year and weather. If we have normal weather, are you saying you would miss the EBITDA range entirely or just maybe trend towards the lower end?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. What I'm saying is if we have normal weather, we might have trouble meeting some of the volume expectations that we have for the full year right now, because obviously, to achieve the volume guidance that we have, we're going to have to be in a position to run hard. And actually what I was saying is, as I'm looking at the way things are trending, if we had something that was more normal as opposed to better, I would think the volumes would be under more pressure than the EBITDA would be under. Now, of course there's a linkage between the two. I'm not ignoring that, but I'm just looking at it on a relative basis, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, you referenced in, I think, your letter some mid-year price increases. Can you just provide some additional color on that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, the mid-year price increases had gone in in some markets. They're not hugely widespread. They're more project by project, size by size, sometimes location by location based. Part of what we've heard very clearly from our customer base is from a planning perspective, it helps them considerably more if they can plan for that one time and do that coming into the year. And in many respects, we planned for that this year and they did as well. So they have not been as widespread as we would've seen in years past. At the same time coming into the year, you were seeing relatively robust pricing.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: I will chime in. Anne, you rock. You will be missed.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: The volume you lost to weather happened in markets where you're not really capacity constrained and the construction industry overall I would think is not constrained in those markets. So can you get caught up more quickly in the Carolinas and Georgia?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Again, yeah, the short answer is you're right. We can crush plenty of stone in the Carolinas and Georgia today. I think we can certainly put it on the ground to meet the customers' needs. I think it's going to be how much can they take and how much can the weather permit. I think those are the issues that we're going to run into, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And all the facility cleanups were done by the end of the quarter?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I mean from just rain events and otherwise, yeah, largely so.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, is it fair to assume that you guys are in the middle of it with the pickup in highway volumes, or is it a little more muted than expected?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I'll concede it has been slower than I would've thought. And I think it's been slower than a lot of people would've thought. I don't have any concern about what the end result will be because you've got the FAST Act, you've got the funding, and you've got the state initiatives. So I know that's coming. But I will concede I think the work itself has moved slower. Now, in fairness, one of the things that we outlined is that work tends to be more weather sensitive than many. And think of it in these terms, Craig. If you're pouring a concrete foundation for a non-residential use, you can go out there and pour that between storms if you've got a good sub-base that's in. By contrast, if you're building or constructing new highway or new lanes and you have significant earthwork that has to be undertaken, you can't do that when it's wet. You literally can't move those heavy, wet, clayey soils. So, I do think the public work is probably disproportionally impacted by wet weather, and I do think there is disproportionate new public work that's coming in portions of those Southeastern markets as well. So if we're looking at some of the work around Atlanta or the work on I-4 in Florida or part of what's going on on I-77 in Charlotte, those are big public jobs and they were clearly weather affected.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And since no one else has asked it, it's a small product line but you blew it out with asphalt and paving in the quarter. Is there anything changing or can you give us more color around that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? It was a great quarter. I think they're going to have a great year. Frankly, the expectations for 2018 in that business continue to be very strong. The outlook is good, the backlog is strong, strong demand from municipalities there. You know, keep in mind, that's really only a Colorado business for us. So everything from Greeley down to Colorado Springs, which was really a new market for us as we went into it early last year, are really very attractive. I talked about the funding that we're seeing in places like Colorado Springs. We've got an exceptional team running that business up and down the Rocky Mountains, and I just can't say enough good things about them. That's a business that has performed exceptionally well, and we continue to look for great things from them.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. For all the things you just described, it would suggest that maybe the ag volumes in Colorado are similar to what you're seeing in asphalt and paving because there (01:06:36).
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, it goes back to part of the commentary that I had and that is, if there's a place that I think before the end of the year that might be tight on ag volumes in our footprint, it's most likely going to be Colorado, because what you've got in Colorado is an awfully powerful combination of public work that's good and private work that's good. So what we're seeing in that marketplace, remember, that's the only place that we're vertically integrated all the way through from stone to ready-mix, to hot-mix and hot-mix paving right now. There's not a lot that's not working for us in Colorado today.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Craig.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hey, this is actually Jeff (1:07:28) in for Garik. I really appreciate you taking my questions. My first is following up on a question Scott had earlier about Mid-America pricing coming in a little lower than was expected and Ward, you mentioned the role mix played. Are you expecting any other mix headwinds as we move into the back half of the year that could play a similar role in pricing coming in maybe a little lower than how people were expecting?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: The fact is there may be a little bit more fill work that we'll do in that marketplace. But again, what I would encourage you to remember, we're not cannibalizing aggregate sales with the fill work. I mean, this is the right absolute right financial operational and otherwise decision on that. It is purely an optical circumstance. I mean, pricing in that division and in that part of the country is moving the way that you would expect. So if you see some more fill in that marketplace, the way I would think about that if I were you is we're getting a waste product, we're being paid for it, we're moving it out of our quarries and most likely opening up more reserves in the process. So could you see some of that in the second half particularly as you see more brand new construction? I think so. Is it anything in my view for you to be concerned about? I would certainly dissuade you from being concerned about that.
Unknown Speaker: Got it, got it. Thanks. And you had a solid quarter in cement with 8% volume growth. Can you get a little more color into how the quarter played out and any update on the potential mid-year price increase as well?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. You're right. We think that was a good quarter. Volume was our friend, pricing was our friend, costs were our friend and gross profit all improved versus the prior year. Pricing was up 5% versus the prior year. Most of the gains were concentrated in the North, so they were largely ahead of expectations. The South lagged out a little bit. By that I mean, really what's going in San Antonio. Part of what's going to be our friend on that as we go through the years is our kiln expenses are expected to be down. So, if I gave you a good sense of what they should look like for the rest of the year, that's probably helpful. Obviously in Q1, we had kiln expenses of $4.2 million; in Q2, $3.5 million. In Q3, we're expecting $400,000. In Q4, we're expecting about $10.2 million. So we're looking for full-year kiln expenses there of about $18.3 million which is compared to $20.9 million in the prior year, so about a $2.6 million friendly number there. Part of what I like about the cement business in Texas, if we're looking at what forecasts say going out as far as 2021, that's a marketplace that's anticipating about 19.6 million tons of need by the time it gets to 2021. That's versus about 16.2 million tons this year, so that market continues to grow. We're in a position that we can grow with it. Our share has remained very steady at 20% to 21%. We are looking at we believe about a $12 a ton price increase as we come into the year next year. We have had some conversations about an October price increase, that's TBD. We'll just have to see how that goes. But again we feel very good about the $12 that we put in for next year. Some of that ties back into the commentary that I offered before and that is people are much more moved by one price increase at the beginning of the year that they can plan for and the less mid-years, frankly, the better customers will feel about it.
Unknown Speaker: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Ward, and Anne, congrats on your retirement.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff (1:11:17).
Operator: Thank you and this does conclude today's Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Q1 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's first quarter earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. In addition, and as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our website and in our SEC filings. As you read in this morning's first quarter 2017 earnings release, Martin Marietta performed very well with diluted earnings per share reaching $0.67. Our bottom line was driven by our ability to set records or near records on a number of key financial metrics, among them, net sales, consolidated gross profit, earnings from operations, net earnings and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA. To remind you, the first quarter of 2017 is being compared against last year's unusually favorable first quarter operating conditions, and notably, significantly eclipsed all other historical first quarter results for the company prior to 2016. This year's first quarter can be summarized as follows: We translated strong top line growth into solid profitability and cash flow generation. Our results are even more impressive when you take into account that during the period, we accelerated production and maintenance costs to better position Martin Marietta for anticipated robust market condition in many of our geographies. As significant as we believe our headline numbers are, we think you'll be more interested into delving into where these results are coming from, and the quality more so than the quantity of the numbers. Further, we typically regard the last several weeks of the first quarter as a springboard for following quarters and, as we will address later, future years. These strong results are no coincidence, but rather, the product of our team's thoughtful strategic planning process, placing us directionally and geographically in the right places with the right people and resources and at the right time. This vital coalescence of planning, disciplined operational execution and commercial performance provided our business with a remarkable financial outcome in what has always been ours and the industry's least profitable quarter of the year. Thus, Martin Marietta now safely, operationally and otherwise, enters the beginning of the 2017 construction season fully prepared to meet increasing customer demand as the durable economic recovery continues across our businesses. Against that backdrop, it's not surprising that our disciplined execution resulted in the following for the first quarter: record net sales of $792 million, record consolidated gross profit of $147 million and near-record earnings per diluted share of $0.67. Additionally, our growth translated to near record first quarter EBITDA of $148 million and operating cash flow of $74 million. These first quarter results reinforced our outlook and expectations for a vibrant 2017 construction season. Our full year 2017 guidance, which we reaffirmed in today's release and is summarized on slides seven and eight, reflects our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to continue to capitalize on the country's macroeconomic momentum and deliver volume growth, strong pricing and expanding margins across the enterprise. Broad pricing gains throughout our aggregates-led Building Materials business contributed to our record first quarter performance. Aggregates product line average selling price increased more than 5% over the comparable prior-year period, led by the Southeast Group's 10.3% increase, the Mid-America and West Groups reported increases of 4.4% and nearly 3%, respectively. The ready mixed concrete business with operations primarily Texas and Colorado delivered a more than 3% increase in average selling price per cubic yard and our cement (05:34) increased 2.5%. We're particularly encouraged by the price gains in cement as these are ahead of our announced April price increases. The pricing increases combined with the quarter's solid shipments enabled us to turn in such outstanding first quarter performance. Shipment growth was seen in our Southeast Group and Rocky Mountain division as each delivered double-digit aggregates product line volume growth with increases of 16% and 15%, respectively. We view this performance as particularly notable. Remember, our Rocky Mountain division was one of the earliest regions of the United States to enter an economic expansion while conversely the Southeast is accelerating beyond recovery into expansion. We believe this underscores both the durable nature of the construction expansion in Colorado as well as its natural and expected broadening to Martin Marietta's important Southeastern markets. In the Mid-America Group, the Mid-Atlantic division, which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, reported a volume increase of 1.5% against a challenging year-over-year comparison. South Carolina drove performance in the quarter as that state continues to benefit from its own early phase of economic expansion. Further, South Carolina's strength alone nearly offset this year's more normal winter weather patterns experienced in the Mideast and Midwest divisions. Additionally, we saw volume increases in the continued vibrant Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace as well as a pickup in shipments in Houston. Volumes predictably declined in South Texas as we experienced an interim period following 2016's completion of several significant energy-related projects. As a reminder, new large energy-related projects are planned for later this year and next. We see further encouraging signs in Texas. The overall energy sector is in recovery, and importantly, the North Texas market remains consistently good. Accordingly, our March 2017 cement shipments were at the highest level since our acquisition of these strategic assets in mid-2014. Moreover, shipments represented the highest level for March in the Texas cement operations since 2003. The strength of cement volumes led our operational team generating the best March financial performance for that business during those same periods. When coupled with the Portland Cement Association's, or PCA, forecast, calling for multi-year growth in Texas cement shipments, we believe March's results serve to reinforce our confidence in PCA's positive 5-year outlook. To complete the discussion of the Building Materials business, our ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines reported volume gains for the quarter with particular strength in Colorado. Collectively, our Building Materials business generated $125 million of gross profit. The Southeast Group led gross margin performance with a 120 basis point expansion over the prior-year quarter, driven by the previously mentioned average selling price and volume growth together with solid cost control. The Building Materials business' first quarter results reflect $4 million of kiln maintenance costs and the cement product line. We also accelerated certain operational preparations in our aggregates product line including grain, equipment maintenance and repair as well as increased production where possible to increase our readiness for the remainder of 2017. In addition to our impressive Building Materials business' early results, the Magnesia Specialties business also delivered a record first quarter with net sales of $63 million, reflecting an increase of more than 6% compared with the first quarter of 2016 with growth in both the chemicals and lime products volumes. Gross margin was over 35% despite higher natural gas prices and increased contract service expenses. To summarize our first quarter discussion, it's fair to say that we believe our financial and operating results are a harbinger of things to come as our multi-year outlook remains optimistic. The fundamental drivers of the broad-based construction recovery including sustained employment growth in key Martin Marietta metropolitan areas remains firmly in place and our operations are well prepared to meet increased product demand. As we've often noted, job growth in our key markets is a critical metric since it serves as an important catalyst for overall construction activity. The United States added nearly 2.4 million jobs during the trailing 12 months and positive employment data from Martin Marietta's top states further solidifies our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and beyond, with Florida ranked second; Texas, third; Georgia, fifth; and North Carolina, seventh in overall job growth for the trailing 12 months ended February 2017. Importantly, job growth in these key markets is accelerating faster than the United States average. Job growth is also important because it serves as a stimulant for construction activity for all end users: residential, nonresidential and infrastructure. The residential marketplace, which accounted for 22% of our first quarter aggregates product line shipments, is benefiting from continued economic recovery, particularly in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Florida. We see no evidence of these positive trends reversing and consequently, it's our belief that we will witness steady, multi-year residential demand growth. Overall, housing starts remain well below the historical average of 1.5 million per year. Further, important Martin Marietta metros continue to outperform the national average with cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver and Raleigh leading the country in new permitting activity. We're also encouraged by increasing levels of single-family housing permits in many of our key metro markets, with Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, Tampa, Orlando and Charlotte, comprising the top six performers nationally. By its nature, single family housing and related subdivision development activity are considerably more aggregate intensive than our multifamily construction. We also see broad positive trends in non-residential growth. North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, continue to benefit from improving economies, consistent job gains and large corporate relocations, all of which fuel construction activity. Consistent with this data, as of March 2017, the Dodge Momentum Index was at an eight-year high, signaling continued non-residential growth. Turning to infrastructure, we remain confident that the benefits of federal, state and local funding increases, including those in the $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, will have positive impacts on infrastructure construction activity in 2017 and beyond. Critically important examples of these state and local-led initiatives include the record Florida Department of Transportation budget of nearly $11 billion, the emerging impact of Georgia's State House Bill 170, which is expected to double their state-level transportation construction investment and Colorado Spring's local 2C sales-tax initiative, adding tens of millions of dollars of incremental infrastructure investment in that community. As a reminder, the 2017 guidance we provided in February and reaffirm today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment, nor does it include any benefits gained from actions taken to reduce businesses' regulatory burden. In fact, while we're encouraged by the emerging bipartisan views articulated in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure, in the near term, we believe the pace of highway construction activity may actually benefit more from regulatory relief. The ability for states to bring projects forward and expedite large project approvals should generate increased product demand in both the near and long-term. In line with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $102 million of capital in our businesses and returned $127 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 458,000 shares of our common stock, together with our quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. As a reminder, since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we've returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we have 14.6 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2017 was 1.9 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant. As we look forward to the remainder of 2017 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest we've ever seen. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity across our three primary end use markets is underpinned by employment gains in our top markets and consistent with third-party forecasters. Our longer-term view is consistent with those of Dodge data and analytics and the PCA, which both forecast growth in construction starts for 2017 and the next several years. These trends support our confidence in the durability of what we view as the ongoing multi-year construction recovery. Again, consistent with the full year guidance we provided in February, we expect aggregates product line infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid-single-digits. Nonresidential volumes are expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digits. Residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid to high-single-digits and ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be stable. On a consolidated basis, we expect to deliver another record year with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion, a further expansion of gross profit and increased EBITDA ranging from $1.050 billion to $1.130 billion. Additionally, in this morning's release, we increased our capital expenditure guidance range from $350 million to a range of $400 million to $500 million as we anticipate the acceleration of certain capital projects to further prepare our operations for increased demand for our products. In conclusion, we not only delivered strong first quarter results, but we also made timely investments in our business and set the stage for us to continue to capitalize on the additional construction demand we see across the vast majority of our markets throughout 2017 and beyond. As the construction recovery broadens, we're well-positioned to deliver increasing shareholder value from our network of quarries, distribution yards and plants. Martin Marietta remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan and wholly committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, ethical conduct, operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Thank you for taking my questions today. The first quick question on volumes. Could you help us walk through the volume flow through inter-quarter and how this compares to what would be a typical calendar Q1?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Kathryn, what we're delighted to say is this finally does look like a more typical Q1. So if we think about what happened last year, we came out of the gate very strong in January and February and things started pulling back modestly in March. That's exactly the opposite that we saw this year. We saw that both in aggregates and in cement as well. So what we've said for a long time, Kathryn, and really I've captured some of it in the commentary that we published today as well, the last two weeks of March usually make or break the quarter. And what we saw this year was frankly, we were considerably behind in January. You would expect that. We closed the gap, but we're still considerably behind when we finished February and then, really, we finished that March in March. So if we think about the way just on the cement side – and you can take some of this and extrapolate it to the aggregates side. In Texas, cement volumes were down in January 14% for the overall marketplace, for us down 7%, for the overall marketplace down 12%, for us down 17%. Then in March, for the overall marketplace, up 17%; for us, it was up 20%. So if we think about the two places in particular that we saw a pop in aggregates in the first quarter, it was really twofold: one, Southeast because in large part we're getting ready for what we believe will be a very busy year in Florida this year; and two, in the Rocky Mountains. They had a very good quarter in the first quarter. And part of what I was really excited to see in that is we put up good pricing numbers in the first quarter despite the fact that actually Colorado, which you'll recall as one of our lower-priced states, actually came out of the box disproportionally good on volumes. So that's the way the quarter built, Kathryn, both from an aggregate side and the cement side.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you. I want to shift to margins. Could you walk through some of the greatest drivers for some of the margin compression we saw in Q1? And in particular, it'd be helpful to better understand how much was more related to just lower volumes, just from fixed cost leverage, if volumes being flattish in total versus higher cost in that preparation for the spring construction season that you mentioned in your prepared commentary.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. Kathryn, let me start with the notion that we're firmly committed to what we said. We're going to hit 60% incremental margins on average as we recover the first half of volume from that 80 million ton decline that we saw. So let's start with that. If you look at what we're anticipating through our guidance, what we're expecting is almost a 200 basis point improvement in our full-year consolidated gross margin as we look across the business for the full year. As far as the first quarter was concerned, really two different things drove the margin performance. Number one, we saw a $6 million increase in personnel. And what does that mean? It means number one, we've got some businesses operating this year in the first quarter that we didn't have operating last year in the first quarter. Number two, we have been working more hours as well because frankly, we're trying to put material on the ground because here's the high-class problem, Kathryn. I think there are going to be certain markets this year that we're going to see stone shortages in. So the importance to put material on the ground, we think was important. That was $6 million. We had an additional $4 million in grading. And what does that mean? It means we're opening up reserves, so we can be in a position to access those reserves and process it as efficiently as possible. So that's $6 million and $4 million; that gets you to $10 million. We also had $2 million in higher freight costs. That was principally moving material from South Georgia by rail into Florida as we anticipate that economy being really quite good this year. So if we back out those $12 million on increased personnel, contract grading and higher freight costs, we would have been right there at the 60% incremental gross margin. So I think that addresses your question specifically. One other item of note that I'd like to say is we grew the top line by $58 million or $36 million or 62% of that growth was from ready mixed concrete and two-thirds of the ready mixed concrete was growth from new acquisitions, meaning the Ratliff transaction that we did in Texas last year. So what I think you've seen us do with ready mixed business is as we've taken them through our process, as you have seen those margins get better over time. So I think the effect was two-fold. One, what was the investment? And that's the way that we see it in the aggregates business to be ready for the rest of the year, and then you did have a little bit of an early shift on ready mixed. So again, our confidence in what's going to happen with those incremental margins is still very high. But I hope that responsive, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yes, that is. And then final question, and you touched on it just briefly in your response, is just more on product availability. Something that we are hearing more consistently, we've heard in spot markets last year, but more consistently is a potential of a tightening of clean stone supply as we head into the spring construction season. Could you just maybe share some comments? Are you seeing that? And what have you done to prepare for this possibility? And when was the last time you even have seen this happen?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. We'll start with the concept; it's a nice problem, right, Kathryn? It's been a long time since we've had that issue. It's probably been in decade-ish since we've that issue. Do I think we're going to see that in some markets this year? The answer is yes. Do I think it's likely that portions of Colorado will see it? Yeah. Do I think it's possible portions of the Midwest, meaning parts of Iowa, will see that? I think so. Is it possible that you may see that in parts of the Mid-America Group as well? So the East Coast of the United States. I think so. So if we're looking at potential shortages later in the year, I would suggest it's probably in those three different divisions. And again, if you're asking what we're doing in advance of it, I think it goes right back to these numbers that I went through with you in the answer to your second question, and that is we're putting stone on the ground, we're investing in people to make sure that we're in the ability to meet that market need as much as we can as we go forward.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Thanks so much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thank you. Just have a question first off, on your guidance. Just given the strength in volume, particularly later in March, which Ward, you indicated is usually instructive for full-year momentum. Just wondering as to the thoughts behind maintaining your volume guidance at this point as opposed to potential upside just given how demand accelerated as the quarter progressed?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, I guess, our sense on that, Garik, was we just want to remember that we're three months in. So our primary view is let's come back and see where we are at half-year. And then if it's appropriate to adjust our guidance at that time, we certainly can. But again, if you're gleaning from my comments and from the release that at least sitting where we sit right now, we have a very favorable outlook for the year, I think that's entirely right. But I think we saw a lot of folks get excited last year after Q1 and probably get a little bit ahead of themselves, and we didn't want to do that this year.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thanks. I wanted to shift to pricing. If you could just talk about two regions that were both above and below your, I guess, consolidated results, the Southeast Group and the double-digit pricing gains in the West Group, which had low-single digit pricing gains. Was there any mix impact in either of those two regions that stand out? I'd just like to get some thoughts on those two markets.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I guess, a couple of things. One, I think both those markets from a pricing perspective are in a pretty healthy place. Number two, we did indicate we were sending more material into Florida this year. And of course, that's going to be freight impacted material because in large part it's moving by rail, going into that marketplace, so there would be some push there, but very, very small, Garik. So I don't want you to get ahead of yourself on that. The other thing that I would say relative to the West is twofold. One, I mentioned in my early comments that there's a lot of activity in Colorado, so if we pause and say, okay, if you've got good activity in Colorado, great market for Martin Marietta, but still one of its lower-priced aggregates market. So you are going to see a little bit of an optical headwind on West pricing there. Number two, and this is fascinating; we actually saw volume actually go up modestly in Houston, which I think is a good sign because part of what we had believed is that Houston has found bottom in that marketplace. At the same time, I did indicate in my commentary that we saw less going into South Texas. And again, that was driven by the roll-off of some of those very large LNG plays last year. Again, we think there's more in the queue, and we think that's coming later this year, probably more of an impact next year. But again, when you're talking about South Texas, those two are freight adjusted movements that are going there. So there is some modest mix in those. I think the last piece I would call out to you is we did have more April 1 price increases this year, particularly in portions of Texas. So again, as we're sitting here looking at pricing, Garik, of the things that I have some degree of latent concerns about, pricing is not on that list.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, thanks. And my last question is just on the increase in the CapEx guidance. Could you help us understand where specifically the increase is coming from? And how should we think about CapEx long-term given the step up in 2016?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, I guess I would say this. I'll tell you what it is. I won't tell you necessarily where it is with great precision. The big thing that's driving it, Garik, is real estate. We have the opportunity in some places that are important to us to make some generational purchases of land. And obviously in the business that we're in, making sure you control your future through having land in the right places is strictly important to us. So there are a handful of real estate transactions out there that really drove the big change in that. What I would say going back to your broader question on where we will be overall through a cycle, remember the way that we typically talk about CapEx. Stay-in-business CapEx and DD&A are numbers that are relatively even with each other. So for us, let's call it $275 million, $280 million worth of DD&A and stay-in-business CapEx. Obviously, as we went through the down cycle, we pulled back on CapEx. You saw us spending CapEx below DD&A for a number of years. You should expect us to be above DD&A for a number of years, particularly in this type of environment because if we're entering a phase that we may have issues keeping enough stone on the ground, again, that's a nice issue for us. From a capital expenditure perspective, if we ignore what we just discussed on the land, much of what we're doing is addressing rolling stock right now because fixed plant, as you recall, we had the capacity in old Martin Marietta before TXI to put 205 million tons of stone on the ground. So we can put that through our plants very, very quickly and very easily, but making sure we can hit stone starved areas, and a good example of it is what we're doing in Northern Colorado with the rail yard that we're putting in the marketplace right now, is important for us. So some of it's land, some of it's tied to distribution and some of it's tied to rolling stock. But hopefully, that gives you a sense through a cycle. I think if we ignore the real estate issues, Garik, I think that range that we'd given you before of around $350 million is right in the sweet spot.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Helpful. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Hirschman with Stephens, Inc.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Ward and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hey, Blake.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: My first question, you and some of your primary competition have spoken optimistically about the M&A pipeline and the likelihood that activity might begin to ramp here. Just wondering if there's any update today that you could provide us with.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what I continue to think that this is a year that there will be a lot of conversation. And it makes sense. Again, we've spoken about the fact that while the cycle's nowhere near what we would've seen previously as peaking, it's clearly a lot better than it was seven or eight years ago. So I think there are closely held family businesses that are thinking about generationally where they want to be in their business. And I think there are others who are thinking about whether this is or is not a good exit point. So, obviously, we're interested in growing our business. But, as you know, we're very consistent with our planning process. Where we are matters a lot to us and assuring that we're putting ourselves in the right markets, and as I said in the prepared commentary, with the right people and the right resources, is vitally important to us. So it's not just any transaction that we're going to be looking at. We're looking at what we feel like are the deals that are the right deals for this company that make us better, not necessarily bigger. But I continue to believe this is a year that you could see some fairly significant transaction activity potentially.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then on the ready mixed side of the business, how do you think about the margins on that piece through the cycle? How do you look at the material spreads there? And should we expect that the material spreads will continue to expand with increasing input costs like the cement and aggregate costs? Thanks and good luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, thank you very much. Number one, we anticipate the ready mixed business, as it continues to mature in our portfolio will get up into that nice mid-teens type margin area. That's what we anticipated. That's the type of March that we're seeing. So I think as we look at that business, we're very comfortable with where we are. And again, keep in mind, our ready mixed business is really driven by two markets, in particular. It's what's happening in Texas and it's what's happening in portions of Colorado. And remember, our ready mixed business is really only in two places, realistically, in Texas. It's a North Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth market and some in Central Texas and then up and down that front range in Colorado. So again, we're very careful about where we want to be in that vertically integrated business. As far as pricing commentary, because that's clearly been a nice driver for that business, what we're looking at in the marketplace, particularly in Texas right now, is a $6 to $8 a cubic yard price increase and we're seeing that in large part across all different end uses. So again, we feel very good about where that market sits today. One of the things that I think it's fair to say, we are considering a price increase for both ready mixed and cement, again, in October, again, anticipating very, very busy markets in that end use for the balance of the year. So, Blake, I hope that helps.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hey. How are we doing, Jerry?
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Doing well, thanks. How are you?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Not bad.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ward, you spoke about improved volumes in March and I'm just wondering if you could talk about how broad-based that is. Obviously, you cited Texas with very good numbers. What proportion of your markets would you say were up year-over-year in March? And then if you can comment, the numbers that you cited in Texas for cement. Is that representative of your volumes in March in aggregates in Texas as well?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. It would move around a bit. Here's what I would say. If we look across our spectrum for the quarter, I see a lot more green than I do red. So let's just start with that. But clearly March was an important month for us. If we think about the way the different markets are performing in Texas, what I'll tell you is North Texas is clearly the most healthy market in that marketplace. Back to the commentary that I was offering a few minutes ago in acquisitions, why where you are matters. Remember, 45% of our aggregate volume in Texas is in North Texas. So if we're going to have a market in Texas that's performing well, we'd like it to be DFW. So what I would tell you is the DFW market is strong. We think if it has a normal weather year this year, it will be very strong. Remember, I was talking about October price increases, again, in ready mixed in that marketplace. As we look at the Central Texas market, that's really driven by what's happening in San Antonio and Austin, again, a very healthy marketplace. That's about 30% of our volume. If we look at the marketplace in Houston today, that's about 10% of our volume. And Houston, as I mentioned, we actually saw a volume pickup in the first quarter and we're pleased by that because again, we think Houston has found bottom. We did see South Texas lower. And again, I'm not concerned about South Texas. I think what we're in is exactly what we described. It's an interim period. And I think given some of the large projects that we see coming in that marketplace in non-res in the latter part of 2017 and, frankly, more impactfully, into 2018, yeah, I think we're in a nice place from a volume perspective there. What I'm particularly excited about is what we're seeing in Georgia and Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, because remember, Jerry, part of what we've said for years is when the bottom right-hand corner of that map for us gets healthier, it's disproportionally important. And going back to one of the conversations I had with Kathryn early on in the call, some of those markets in the East we think we may see some stone shortages this year. And again, that's a very, very different point in the cycle for those markets that we've seen for a decade. So if we're seeing that type of activity here as we wrap up Q1, it's a nice place to be, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And, Ward, in terms of other pricing actions that you're considering, so you mentioned the Texas market should be supportive of price increases for aggregates and potentially in the East. Can you talk about other markets as well and the cadence of potential pricing actions this year? I think last year, you folks didn't push pricing over the course of a year, so you probably have some relatively easy pricing comps in the back half. Is that right?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I think we'll clearly come back and talk to you more about that at half year. There are a number of markets this year that the price increases really didn't hit until April 1. So I think to the extent that they're mid-years, they're likely to be even later in the year than they typically would have been because some of the ones really didn't start this year until April 1. So I think that's probably a conversation when we're having the next one of these calls, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, guys, for taking my call – question. Going back to the Southeastern market, I mean, obviously, great growth there. Where would you guess we are in recovery to quote a normalized sort of a market within that piece?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I would tell you that we're still early in that. I mean, it's always interesting. Despite the fact that we live in basketball territory, we usually think of things relative to innings. And if we're looking at where we are on the Southeast, I think we're probably in the fourth inning. And by the way, that's a game that can play extra innings down there as well, so I'm not sure fourth is really that late. And think of it in these terms, Stanley. Georgia and Florida today are truly one of the best economies in the nation, but I think each one has plenty of room to grow. I mentioned in the opening comments that the House Bill 170 benefits in Georgia should visibly emerge this year. As in other markets, what we're seeing right now is increased non-res activity and investment in distribution and warehouse facilities so along interstate corridors and airport hub locations. So if you're thinking about what you're seeing in that whole corridor from Atlanta, down into the Orlando, Tampa area, it's doing exceptionally well with that. But there's some other things that strike me right now. For example, Alabama is actually considering raising its gas tax to begin addressing years of under investment in that work. But critically, what we're seeing in both res and non-res work in Georgia is very strong. And what we're seeing on I-4 work in Florida. Remember, that felt some degrees of delays last year. So from our perspective, with an $11 billion DOT budget in Florida, a doubling of the DOT budget in Georgia, res in both those states that's performing very well, and in Georgia we care about that because we'll sell stone to it. In Florida, while we may not sell stone to the res market, what it's doing is keeping others very much tied up in res and we can come back and really feed that large infrastructure market that's largely what we do. So, again, if you think back to a Georgia market that saw, say, 70% of its volume go away from peak to trough, if you think back to cycle, that's one reason that when we talk about innings, we're still talking very early in the innings, Stanley. I hope that helped.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, yeah and I agree. Switching gears to on the pricing piece, you had the March cement numbers were very, very good. Can you talk about the confidence that $8 per ton out there? Do you think that there was some pull-ahead trying to beat that increase, or just give your thoughts on the realization of that $8 as we're looking at the rest of the year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? I think you're going to see realization work in different ways in that marketplace. And do I think the $8 works very well in Dallas-Fort Worth? Yeah. Do I think it's going to be a little bit less than that but not remarkably less than that in places like Waco and Austin and San Antonio and Corpus? Yeah, probably so, probably closer to that $5 to $6 area. I think parts of East Texas will likely see that $8 number. And I think one of the markets that will be tougher this year on cement will continue to be Houston. But again, if you think about where our cement plants are, one in Midlothian and one at Hunter outside San Antonio, San Antonio and Dallas are the markets that will principally drive what we see in cement. And again, we see something there that's really very healthy. And we're back to the concept of I think those types increases that I just went through with you stick. And again, we're looking to come back and have a series of conversations about doing something, again, in October.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. And the last question, you mentioned something about the regulatory relief. If we think normally kind of an 18- to 24-month period following monies coming to the system, the excitement around the regulatory relief, is that that more projects will come to fold or is it that the duration of the vetting process gets curtailed down? Kind of thoughts around that, if you could, please.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think the answer, Stanley, is yes. And I think what you end up are with less project delays, I think you end up with less project costs. And I think you end up with less opportunities for frivolous litigation. I actually had an opportunity to speak before a House committee here about a month or a month and a half ago and spoke very directly to some projects that I felt like had suffered from those very types of maladies. And I think to the extent that we see some degrees of regulatory reform around those, I think we can actually see more projects coming forward and more projects being put to work on the ground, which will need our products. So that's the way we look at that. I do genuinely believe that a highway build is important. But if we get regulatory reform right, it can be equally as impactful.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yep. Great. Well, thanks guys and best of luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Stanley.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Timna.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello. Just taking a step back, there was two things I wanted to think though regarding catalysts for the company going forward. One is really if you could remind us about your exposure in the energy paths in U.S. land stories, of course, progressing nicely forward. And I just wonder if you could remind us where you're seeing business there, or options for growth.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, as we look at what's going on in the energy patch right now, what I will tell you is our Q1 shale volumes were 315,000 tons. That was down 134,000 tons from prior year. And here's what I would tell you: we have put up just about record results in many respects in Q1, and I can tell you what was going on relative to energy in Q1 was almost immaterial to our business. So to the extent that we see things happening like they are in the Permian, and they start to get better across some of these other basins, they can be pretty impactful to us. I mean, if I look across the spectrum at what was going on in Haynesville, the Barnett, the Heyworth, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, the only one that actually saw in our group any positive change was actually what was going on in Haynesville and I view that as actually a very good sign. That's more of a gas than it is a wet play. So if we're seeing that type of recovery, we think it's actually pretty important. What I would tell you is I think normal shale demand should be 2 to 2.5 times the current levels. In other words for (44:04) 4 million tons a year. So if we think back to where it was last year, we finished full year 2016 at 1.4 million tons. We had finished 2014 at 7.4 million tons. So what I would tell you is if we go back to where it was in 2011 at 4 million tons or even in 2015 at 3.5 million tons, that, to me, feels more like it. The other thing that strikes me that's different today is in the Eagle Ford, you've got profitable new wells with a WTI at 48 and existing wells are profitable at $29 and shale generally across the U.S. is profitable at $55 for a new well and $38 for existing. So if we think about the footprint that we have and our ability to move by rail, as that marketplace recovers, we should clearly benefit from that. But frankly, we haven't felt that yet.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Is it possible that you're (45:08) market share opportunities given that the rig count is already doubled off the bottom? Is there a reason why you wouldn't have seen some improvement so far on that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think the big issue is, the big place that you're seeing that right now is in the Permian, and that's in West Texas, and that's really a play that's of the moment for us, Timna.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you, okay. And my other question was just I felt like it was topical to revisit the highway, the gas tax on a federal level. Do you believe that any of the high-level conversations there are going to be able to progress given some of the Republicans' stalwart opposition to any new taxes? Or do you think that we're going to need to continue to follow the state-led initiatives to raise gas taxes in lieu of the inaction of the federal side?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I guess I would say two-fold. Number one, I do think we will continue to see state action. So I think if we look at what's happened in Indiana this week, if we look at different conversations around gas taxes in states like South Carolina and Alabama. I mean, let's face it, Timna, if we're talking about raising gas taxes, South Carolina and Alabama would not have been at the head of the class on that conversation 25 years ago. So to the extent that we're seeing that, I think we continue to see it. It's nice to see that the President articulated yesterday that he's open the prospect of a gas tax. I do think there are going to be some portions in the Republican caucus that will struggle with that. At the same time, what I would tell you, Timna, is I think there has been more constructive conversation about different ways to fund this long-term over the last six months to eight months, than we've seen for a long time. I do believe there's more broad consensus around the need for investment in infrastructure across the aisle than we've seen in healthcare and in some respects, in tax reform as well. So I think when this comes up to bat, I think the likelihood of getting something that is serious relief and investment for the industry is there. I think the vehicles may be several-fold. I think the easiest way to address is gas tax. Do I think that's going to be the only way it's address? I don't. That's my quick take on it, Timna.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: No, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for all the disclosure and the CEO letter was a welcome addition. Thanks again.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you very much, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Craig, how are you?
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: I am doing well. And your ready mixed operation had a terrific quarter, driving a lot of the overall quarter. What was the organic volume growth there?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, what the organic volume growth really wasn't that great. If we look at really what happened there, on a prior year variance, what was really driving was what we had in Mid-Central and the Mid-Central is really where that Ratliff business is. So if I look at what Mid-Central did prior year, we're up about, I want to say, it's 706,000 cubic yards in the marketplace all by itself. So really what we had was, from a revenue perspective, a much better volume heading out of what used to be the Ratliff business that we bought last year.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. So the organic volume (48:23) single-digit, is that...?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Again, we're talking first quarter of the year so you're never going to see huge volumes in ready mixed in Colorado. And so yes, it was exactly where we thought it would have been, but for what it came in relative to Ratliff.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then cement, I think I heard a mixed message of you had a terrific March, and that may be representative strength going into the remainder of the year. But was any of that increased volume related to the price increase that's coming in April?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, I don't much think so, Craig. I think what we saw was just a more normal, regular roll through the year. Here's the way that I really describe what we've seen so far this year. If I think back to 2015 or back to 2016, I think a wet second half in 2015 and perfect weather early in 2016 really created work early in 2016 that was wrapping up the 2015 construction season. By contrast, I think what we've seen this year through the slow, steady, more normal built in the first quarter is we're building toward a very healthy 2017 season. So I don't look at what happened in March and right now, feel like I see something that feels anomalous. Right now what I'm seeing is something candidly, Craig, that just feels normal. And we've been waiting for something that looked more normal for a while, even if you think back to our commentary over the last couple of years on weather. We've said we don't need great weather. We just need weather that's more normal. I think that's what we're seeing right now as we talk about these Q1 results.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then I think there's weather in Dallas right now. Are you guys seeing anything to upset that weather wise?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I guess, what I'll say is I don't think I'm telling state secrets when I say that April I think has been wet for a lot of the country. At the same time, you haven't seen us move anything on guidance either. So, I think, look you can watch NOAA, just like I can, and you get a sense of what's going on out there. But again, if we look at what the underlying demand is for the balance of the year, we feel very good.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you talked a little bit about infrastructure legislation and the potential for a federal gas tax. Any progress with the BOLT Act?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That process is going about the way that we would have anticipated. We have a lot of people who have signed on to support it. The money from across industries to make sure that members of Congress understand that I think has been extraordinary. I think it has good, broad, uniform support. And going back to the commentary that I was offering to Timna, that's part of what I'm speaking to when I say I think you've seen a host of innovative and different thought processes coming forward, and those are some of the reasons that I feel confident we will see some degree of regulatory relief relative to infrastructure and investment moving forward. So yes, BOLT has I think reasonable progress behind it right now, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: All right. All right. Thanks a lot, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm taking a look at your capital allocation. And I'm curious to see if this – the increase in your CapEx guidance affects the way you're thinking about, whether it's buybacks or your M&A activity, whether you're putting more money into the ground versus buying back your shares?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I guess what I would say, Scott, is we've always said that our priority is doing the right deal first. So if we find the right transactions, and we can get the types of returns on the right transactions, those will be our number one priorities. Number two, making sure we can really grow this organic business in the right way. Again, I'm not wanting to talk specifically about what the real estate deals are because I think in a competitive world, that's just unwise. But I can tell you if we had investors looking over our shoulder saying, these are what we're looking at, I don't think they'd have any problem with that whatsoever. And the other nice problem that we have, you see what cash flow looked like, you can see what we did during the quarter in share buybacks, and you can see where we are relative to our ratio. So I think our capital priority allocation and strategies remain entirely the same. I think if there's in fact one thing that I think we have been remarkably consistent on it's that portion of our story.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then I want to follow up a little bit more on the comments on the stone shortage. So it sounds like, if I'm understanding it correctly, that you might be able to push pricing maybe toward the higher end of your guidance. But right now, you're keeping your EBITDA guidance and gross profit guidance the same. And I recognize it's only one quarter. But, one, is there opportunity you think to maybe exceed some of the pricing side of things? And conversely, is that going to be offset by any constraints, whether we see tightening, whether it's on rail and the labor supply? How do those coalesce in this equation?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I guess I would say the following. If we think about the areas that I mentioned earlier, that I think you could see some stone shortages. We did talk about Colorado and one thing that's important to remember that, again, that's one of our lowest priced aggregate markets. So if we see pricing opportunities there, and I'm not sure what they can look like, again, you're just talking about moving a marketplace up closer to a corporate average. We also spoke about what could be potential shortages in the Midwestern United States and the Midwestern is typically right at the corporate average, just to give you a sense of that. And as we come back and talk about portions of the Mid-Atlantic, they tend to be above the corporate average. So what's interesting, as you go through it and think about it, Scott, is you have markets that I think could be tight this year, one of which is below, one of which is spot on and one of which is modestly above. So depending on what degrees of short we may or may not see, that's going to drive as much of that as anything. So that's the way that I would encourage you to think about that.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And are you seeing any issues from labor possibly having an impact on volumes?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: For us, not so much. We're not seeing significant issues outside of portions of Texas where labor is tight, particularly North Texas. Labor is getting tighter in portions of Georgia right now as well. And part of what we tried to this year, if you look at the costs that were up in the first quarter, some of that was driven by the fact that we wanted to put more material on the ground. We were also able to keep some of our people busy throughout the winter, which I think right now is an awfully helpful thing for our people and places us, I think, in a better strategic position relative to head count and personnel.
Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Great quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Adam, very much.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Hey, Ward. On the Q4 call, you said a normal Q1 would be kind of 5% to 7% of full-year gross profit. Based upon the Q1 just reported and the guidance, it's 13% to 15% this year. I'm just wondering if that tends to suggest that the full-year guidance is conservative.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I guess, Adam, what I'd say is we'll come back and take a look at that at half year and see where we are. Look, if we look out for the balance of the year, if we have normal weather, and we don't have some big shock to the overall U.S. economy from something, we're in a very attractive place. Part of my commentary said, I think we're in the most attractive spot that we've been maybe in this company's history. So I do think it's too early based on one quarter to do much relative to the guidance. And we do want to be careful and thoughtful around that. But as I indicated as well, when we finished January, we were considerably behind. When we finished February, we were considerably behind. Mind you, behind prior year, not necessarily behind plan. And then we were behind when we got to the halfway point of March and then the afterburners kicked in. So again, it depends on how that rhythm and cadence goes for the rest of the year, but it should be an attractive year, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then I wanted to ask on the infrastructure side. If I look at the Census Bureau construction put in place numbers for highway and street, it's down 2% on average over the past 12 months. I'm just wondering if that's indicative of what you've seen in your states. And if I'm hearing you correctly, that headwind turns into a tailwind later this year.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I guess what I would say, Adam, if you think about our different states, and let's just march through the top ones, I mean, I don't see anything slower with TxDOT. And if anything, what I see is TxDOT really having gotten through, maybe not all the issues they had last year in putting work out, but a significant piece of it. So do I think there's going to be good infrastructure work in Texas, our largest state by revenue? Yes. Do I think there's going to be good infrastructure work in Colorado, up and down the I-25 corridor? Absolutely. Do I think those transactions that we did last year in Southern Colorado or in Colorado Springs for that 2C sales tax initiative, will do exceptionally well in infrastructure? I do. If we come to our third state by revenue and look at North Carolina, do I think we're going to have a better infrastructure year in this state with activity building, for example, on I-77 throughout the year and I-85? I do. If we go to our fifth largest state by revenue and really take Florida and then flow in – I'm sorry, Georgia, then flow into Florida, again, I think we're going to see the real impact of House Bill 170 this year in Georgia and I think, look, we've got an $11 billion record DOT spend in Florida. And then if we go up to Indiana, and keep in mind, by the time we rack up those states, we're over 70% of our revenues. And Indiana is just looking at ways and they've just passed a way to put even more money into infrastructure. And remember, our marketplace in Indiana is really driven almost uniquely by Indianapolis. So if I'm looking at what's going on relative to infrastructure, highways, bridges, roads and streets, and I'm looking at our geography and again, back to this notion of where you are matters, I like where we are relative to public work, but I got to tell you, I like where we are relative to private work as well. I don't think I'd want to trade our portfolio with anybody today.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Great. Okay. Thanks, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Good afternoon, Ward and Anne. Congratulations on a great quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Rob, thank you.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Just quickly, Ward, back on the cement question. So you guys have been consistently at about a 21% market share. And I know you've said that that's a good place to be, but do you see some opportunities to increase market share, especially in the North Texas market?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We're very comfortable with where we are in that marketplace. And look, we're looking for efficiencies in that marketplace. Clearly, we've got a large vertically-integrated presence there as well. Okay? I like the way that business is working. I like the leadership that we have there throughout the State of Texas, in every component. But let's face it, that cement business, that very strategic cement business that we bought at mid-2014 has probably done what anybody would have thought and several percentages better. So again, Rob, we're very peaceful with that.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay, great, and just my last question deals with on the infrastructure side. We're hearing a lot from civil contractors as well as design engineers of the emergence of P3 partnerships and it had become a larger funding source for infrastructure-related work. How do you see this funding mechanism playing out as a viable option for projects?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what, Rob? I think it plays out just fine in large metropolitan areas. And I think it plays out not as well in the flyover states. And here's what I would say on that. Can you build more toll roads in Florida? Yeah. Can you do it in Georgia? Yeah. Can you do it in parts of North Carolina or New York or Chicago or other big cities? I think when you're looking at P3 in those places where you have to get some degree of return back, and it's typically driven by tolls, I think it works remarkably well. I think if you're looking at Des Moines and Omaha and parts of Middle-America, I think it gets considerably trickier. So I think we're going to have to have a very different conversation around what is investment and what is funding. And I think P3 is going to be driven by investment and I think you're going to see that disproportionately on each coast and along the Gulf, and I think you're going to have greater funding needs on everyplace in between.
Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the guidance, you mentioned a lot about that already, but is it fair to say the first quarter was ahead of your internal plan at the end of March?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It's fair to say that at the end of March, it was ahead of plan. I think that's an entirely fair observation.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And could you provide any colors on April?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? I'll tell you more about April when we come out at half year. I did indicate, I guess, in my earlier commentary that I don't think we were giving away the store when we said some parts of the United States, it's been wet. But at the same time, you haven't seen us do anything to take down our guidance either. So, more on April when we're together with you at half year.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And my next is on the resi construction. I know it's earlier in the year and you had a good start. I just wanted to get a sense of how you think about the rest of the year connecting that 20%-plus growth and then your high-single digit growth on the guide.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: From where we're sitting right now, I look at two different things. One, I look at permitting activity and I look at starts. And what I would encourage too to remember is, if we're looking at permitting activity outside of New York and New Jersey, permitting activity is really very attractive right now. So if we're looking at the type of activity that we're seeing in housing in places like Dallas, Raleigh, Denver, Minneapolis and Atlanta, and keep in mind we've got seven of the top 10 metros in our footprint, including those top five players. If we look at single-family permits, Martin Marietta metros account for seven of the top 10, including all of the top six. And if we're looking at multi-family, our metros account for six of the top 10, including Denver at number one, Dallas at number two and Raleigh at number three. What I think could be at the moment here, is you are going to slowly see, and we've seen this trend move from west to east, you're going to see a trend of less multifamily and more single family. And from where we sit, that's important because single family's clearly considerably more aggregate intensive than is multifamily. So if we're, again, looking at where we are, and you think back to those leading states, and you think about population dynamics in Texas and Colorado and Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and then you say okay what will housing look like in those states given those population dynamics, we think that's going to be attractive, and we think that's going to be attractive for a while. And it's one of the reasons that we talk about housing relative to what does a 50-year average look like, because we're still looking this year at something that's going to be well below a 50-year average. But economists vary on this. And I've heard economists say that we're heading toward 1.4 million, 1.5 million, or maybe 1.6 million [starts] in this cycle, but clearly, we don't anticipate being that over 2 million in the cycle, and frankly that would not be a healthy place for the United States to be, but where we're building right now, we're very comfortable.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And was there an increase in the lot development you're seeing relative to just homebuilding?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: There is. So the way that we've seen that roll over time, Rohit, is we would see multifamily come back first, we would see single-family infill come after that and then we would see relatively large purchases of land for subdivision activity, and that's what we're seeing particularly in the Carolinas and Georgia right now. That's what we were seeing in Texas three and four years ago; that's what we're seeing in Colorado today. So again, we're now seeing that type of housing activity spread to that bottom right-hand corner of the map that we keep coming back to. Because what's happening is the southeast is returning with a rhythm and a cadence consistent with what we had anticipated we thought we would see. And whether it's infrastructure, non-res or res, all of that's important to us in that marketplace.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. And then on Georgia, more specifically Atlanta, we had the I-85 bridge collapse down here. And I think the GDOT froze some construction activity. Do you think it's going to impact your second quarter or is it too little?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? I think it's probably too early to tell. But I don't think that's going to be at the moment.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, the last question on the FAST Act, it looks like Congress is going to fully fund the transportation budget. And I'm trying to think about how FAST Act rolled out last year, how the incremental dollar from the 2017 budget is going to play out this year. How do you guys think about all that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, I think the primary way we think about that is you're going to have a much more mature Act ahead of you this year, and you're going to see construction activity on things that were being bid last year. So, again, I think you just go back to the normal, as we've said before, the normal rhythm and cadence of the percentage rollouts after new highway build, I think that's what we're going to see at the national level. I think the swing factor for us will be what we're seeing at the state level because there's so much amped up activity in key Martin Marietta states.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. That's all I had.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ward for closing comments.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you again for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. As you can tell, we're optimistic about the future for Martin Marietta, and we believe we're well poised to deliver great results in 2017 and the next several years. Our outlook is firmly supported by continued strong employment growth in our key states, solid construction activity with increased materials demand, and attractive pricing opportunities. We remain confident that successful execution of our strategic approach of delivering leading market positions along high-growth corridors possessing attractive near- and long-term economic characteristics will continue to generate top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder value in 2017 and for years to come. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in August. Until then, thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, or future operating, or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. As detailed in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered a record-setting year in 2016. It was a period in which we derived only modest volume benefit from an improving economic environment. We nonetheless further demonstrated our ability to capitalize in the slow but steady recovery across our businesses and produce outsized results. It was also a year that validated our major organic investments, our strategic focus on high-growth economic corridors, 2014's transformative acquisition and the targeted bolt-ons in 2015 and 2016, all of which have positioned us to take advantage of the current up-cycle. Against that backdrop, by almost any measure among them: net sales, gross profit, net earnings, and earnings per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016, Martin Marietta performed exceptionally well, achieving strong results that were characterized by setting records in each consecutive quarter of 2016 and, of course, for the full year. And as we noted in today's release, the full year 2017 guidance, which is summarized on slides 11 and 12, reflects our confidence in continuing economic momentum and Martin Marietta's ability to capitalize on broadening demand growth and strong pricing across our geographic footprint and for all three of our primary construction end users. As we have frequently noted, the critical macroeconomic metric for our business is job growth, since that serves as a catalyst for overall construction activity. National employment growth remained fairly sluggish in the early years of recovery, as our nation began to emerge from the Great Recession. The jobs continued to become more plentiful in 2015 and throughout 2016. And national employment figures rose as unemployment numbers began to tick down. These job gains combined with the pent-up demand of contractor backlogs resulting from historic rainfall over the past 24 months, certainly impacted some of our 2016 results and should meaningfully strengthen our continued growth in 2017 and beyond. As a result, we entered the current year with the strongest profitability and cash generation outlook we have ever seen. Importantly, the future guidance we're providing today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment. We're encouraged by the emerging bipartisan views articulated in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure. Both the new administration and Congress are focused on infrastructure and broad industrial investment, including innovative financing options. To that end, Senate Democrats recently unveiled the blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure, a $1 trillion 10-year infrastructure plan aimed at initiating the anticipated Congressional debate. And while this single initiative will surely not entirely reflect what the final legislation will look like, it's a definite starting point. Still, we fully expect that the Republican Congress and the President will offer up their own plans. However, from our perspective, whatever finally emerges will almost certainly focus on substantial long-term investment in infrastructure. For our part, we believe the combination of innovative financing options, together with sustainable infrastructure investment is critical to both improve and ensure to the fullest potential, the nation's continued economic growth, global competitiveness and way of life. To that end, we're confident that in 2017, we will see a broad concerted industry end-user driven effort to develop and implement a new and creative federal transportation tax and revenue reform and investment package. The simple fact is the United States needs to at least double the federal government's current annual infrastructure investment of approximately $40 billion. The aim of this undertaking will be to create a permanent, sustainable revenue stream to assure that our nation's infrastructure never again falls into the disarray with which Americans are now confronted in their daily lives and business. Turning now to our full year 2016 operating performance. Strong pricing, diligent cost control and disciplined execution enabled gross margin expansion across all business segments and geographies, which resulted in record consolidated gross profit of $909 million, an increase of $187 million or 26%. Record earnings from operations of $667 million, an increase of $188 million or 39%, and an increase of nearly 55% in earnings per diluted share to a record $6.63. These record results include increased performance-based incentive compensation, which reduced fourth quarter and full year earnings by $0.12 and $0.14 per diluted share, respectively. Additionally, our broad-based profitability growth translated to operating cash flow of $679 million, an increase of $106 million and $972 million of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA. For the year, pricing growth across our aggregates and ready mixed concrete product lines contributed significantly to our record performance. Aggregates product line pricing increased more than 7% over the prior year. The West Group continued to benefit from notable improvement across nearly all markets in Texas, in addition to double-digit growth in Colorado, helping drive the West Group's nearly 11% increase in aggregates product line average selling price. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 4%, respectively. The ready mixed concrete business, with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered an 8% increase in average selling price per cubic yard. Consistent with our commentary throughout 2016, despite the record performance we achieved, there were notable volume hindrances we encountered, including in the fourth quarter, delays in Department of Transportation projects particularly in Texas, reduced energy sector shipments, declines in railroad ballast shipments, pockets of skilled labor shortages for customers, and challenging operating and market conditions resulting from abnormally wet weather. By way of example in the fourth quarter, some of our operating regions were challenged with unscheduled plant shutdowns and work delays due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew, yet we still delivered full-year aggregates product line volume growth of nearly 1.5%. Volume growth was led by a 6.5% increase in the Mid-America Group, which benefited from solid nonresidential and residential demand improvement. Importantly, the expected shift from multi-family to more single-family housing development is evident in North Carolina and South Carolina, which are ranked second and ninth, respectively, for gains in single-family housing starts. Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset shipment challenges and contributed to full year gross margin expansion, up 230 basis points. The growth was led by the 680 basis point margin improvement in the Southeast Group. While pricing and solid cost control drove this margin expansion, we expect further growth as result of favorable demand fundamentals, including the emerging impact of Georgia's state House Bill 170, which is expected to double state level transportation construction investment. Further, Florida and Georgia ranked second and fifth, respectively, in employment gains, which as mentioned earlier, typically serve as a catalyst for residential and nonresidential construction. Beyond the Southeast, we also see strong underlying demand indicators for our products across our geographic footprint. Again, this optimism is anchored by positive macroeconomic facts, including national employment growth, which added 12 million jobs over the past five years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, which did not materially add to our 2016 results, begins to meaningfully impact public construction projects in 2017 and beyond. Additionally, many states and municipalities continue to approve additional funding sources for much needed infrastructure projects to support growing population, as evidenced by the significant number of state and local ballot initiatives that have passed over the previous 24 months. We also see broad positive trends in nonresidential growth, despite some markets experiencing slowdown in energy-related demand. North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Colorado continue to benefit from large corporations relocating to and further investing in these states, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Raleigh, Atlanta, Dallas and Denver are all ranked in the top 15 metros in overall nonresidential construction growth, with Austin not far behind at number 17. Consistent with this data, the Dodge Momentum Index was at an eight-year high as of December and further increased 3.9% in January, which signals continued nonresidential growth. The residential marketplace, which accounted for 21% of our full year aggregates product line shipments benefited from continued economic recovery in many of our top states, including Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas. Although 2016 housing starts of less than 1.2 million remained well below the historical average, positive trends for steady multi-year residential demand growth remained evident. Atlanta leads the country in housing growth, while Denver is ranked fourth. We continue to see an emerging trend in many of our markets from multi-family development towards an increase in more entry-level single-family housing activity. By their nature, single-family housing and related subdivision development are considerably more aggregate-intensive against multi-family construction. We see this trend in significant Martin Marietta cities, such as Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte, Denver and Raleigh. For the full year, our Cement business generated $364 million of net sales and $120 million of gross profit, despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. Excluding the results of the divested California Cement business from the prior year, which provides a same-on-same comparison, operational improvements and increased pricing led to a 500 basis point expansion in the business' gross margin to 33%. The 2015 impact of the divested California Cement operations is detailed on slide 10. The business' full year results reflect $21 million of kiln maintenance costs, including $8 million during the fourth quarter. The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record year, with net sales of $238 million, an increase of nearly 5% compared with 2015. Lower natural gas prices and continued cost control led to a gross margin of approximately 38%, an improvement of 300 basis points. As evidenced in our results, we benefited from strategic diversification of geographic regions and product categories, which provided stability and translated top line growth into increased profitability and cash flow. In line with our stated capital allocation priorities, for the year, we invested $179 million in acquisitions, enhancing our market positions in accordance with our strategic objectives. We also invested $404 million of capital in our businesses and returned $364 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock, together with our recently increased dividend. As a reminder, since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we've returned nearly $1 billion in value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we have 15.1 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2016 was 1.7 times in compliance with our leverage covenant. As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, our overall outlook is the strongest we have ever seen. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity across three primary end-use markets is underpinned by employment gains in our top markets and consistent with third-party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in job growth, while Texas ranks third, Georgia ranks fifth, and North Carolina ranks seventh. Our longer term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge Data & Analytics and the Portland Cement Association, which both forecast growth in construction starts for 2017 and the next several years. These trends support our confidence in the durability of what we view as an ongoing multi-year construction recovery. As previously mentioned, we see positive indicators in our three primary aggregates end users, and expect growth in each in 2017. Aggregates product line infrastructure shipments are expected to increase in the mid-single digits. Non-residential volumes are expected to increase in the low to mid-single digits. Residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid to high-single digits. And ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be flat. Overall, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 5.5%. Aggregates product line pricing is expected to increase 5% to 7%. We also see a strong 2017 for our Cement business. In fact, the Portland Cement Association forecasts positive demand growth for Texas in 2017, followed by an even more robust view of 2018. With respect to 2017 specifically, we anticipate Cement sales to increase 4% to 10% and profitability to increase 8% to 16%. At the midpoint, this translates to an estimated $15 million profitability increase over 2016's impressive results. Additionally, we're forecasting net sales growth for our aggregates-related downstream operations of 7% to 13%. That said, we currently expect gross profit from these businesses to be relatively flat year-over-year due to the completion of several large high-margin projects in 2016. Finally, we expect that in 2017 our Magnesia Specialties business will largely remain flat, replicating its record 2016 performance. On a consolidated basis, we expect 2017 to deliver another record year with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion, a further expansion of gross profit, and an increased EBITDA ranging from $1.050 billion to $1.130 billion. In summary, we're pleased and proud to deliver another year of record performance and significant accomplishments in 2016. We remain confident in the continued, steady economic recovery over the next several years and Martin Marietta's ability to capitalize on additional construction demand. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety; ethical conduct; operational excellence; cost discipline; customer satisfaction; and sustainability. By doing so, we'll remain true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First, focusing on your most important markets contributing to overall volumes, Texas, Colorado, and North Carolina, for instance. What color can you give in terms of large projects that have started over the past, say, three months that perhaps hadn't started six to nine months ago?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, Kathryn. Several of them, if we want to go through them. We're looking in Rocky Mountain, for example. We're now seeing C-470 underway. I-70 is coming behind that in 2018. Between those two, it's going to be about $1.7 billion worth of work. Keep in mind, too, that, that does take into account what's going on with the 2C tax referendum down in Colorado Springs. So, as we're looking at the Rocky Mountain division this year, again, another very healthy year. The only possible headwind we might see in that marketplace would be ballast, which is a carryover from where we've been this year. But even when we look, Kathryn, this is a good data point for you, at our Asphalt and Paving business, the backlogs that we see in that business are 2x right now of what they were last year this time. And keep in mind, they've just come off a record year, so you have to feel pretty encouraged when you see that type of data. When we're looking at the Southwest, again, another important division that you mentioned. And we're looking at a lot work on I-35 East. We're looking at a lot of work on I-75, U.S. 287 is going new work on the 410 loop in San Antonio. And there's a good work still coming on the Grand Parkway in Houston. A contract has not yet been selected for portions of that, but again, impressive work there. If we pause for a second and think about the Southeast. And what I would encourage you to think about, Kathryn, the Southeast, is likely to have a year in 2017 that we thought, it was going to have in 2016. So, we're seeing I-85 widening in Atlanta. In Florida, we're looking at 9B expansion and 295 widening. When we get down to Central Florida, I-4, which has been a big project for years, and we're looking at about 1 million tons of stone on that project over a five-year period. That continues to roll. And at the same time, if we're looking even in Southwest Florida, more work that's relatively new on I-75 and portions of State Road 64 in that state. If we come here to the Mid-Atlantic, which is in North Carolina and South Carolina in our backyard, the Durham Freeway, which is running from Raleigh to the Durham Highway 147 is new and it's underway. We've had I-295 that's starting shipments, we believe, in second quarter of 2017. We're seeing I-85 widening design build projects in this area as well. And if we go a little bit north to Virginia, we're seeing I-64 winding projects and an I-81 Potomac River bridge as well. And then further south, towards Charlotte, I-77 hot lanes, we'll see materials going to that, that we didn't see last year. And we have an I-20 design build project. So, if we're looking at the divisions, as you said, Kathryn, that really makes a difference for us. And we're looking at what's going on relative to public works. I would submit to you, it looks more attractive. Last year was the year, if you think about our volumes. It's the first time I can ever remember. I think going back in the data, we've never seen our infrastructure volumes at less than 40% for a year. They're usually 45%-plus. And we're thinking these types of projects bring it back into a more natural balance. So, I hope that helps, Kathryn?
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yes, it does. Thank you. Maybe shifting gears to downstream. Excluding Ratliff and other acquisitions, and perhaps looking in more on the apples-to-apples comparison, how did downstream volumes do in the quarter? And also were there any meaningful differentiation in pricing with acquired versus legacy pricing?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That wasn't material, because in large part, when we bought Ratliff is we're buying ready mixed operations that were in the golden triangle. So, if you think about that, you're really looking at two different groups, one between i-35 DFW down to the Austin corridor and another from the I-45 DFW to College Station corridor. So, that's really the void that you're filling with that. If we're looking at volumes for the quarter, it's a surprise to come out that we we're looking at about 2.2 million cubic yards. So, they were up over prior year, I'm going to say, about 0.5 million yards of that for the second half of the year were attributable to Ratliff. If we're looking at ready mixed shipments for the full year, it was about almost 8.5 million cubic yards.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: That's helpful. And just for Cement or kiln maintenance for 2017, could you...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: ...give a little bit more color on how that will progress, and any differentiation from how it hits from a quarter standpoint versus 2016?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. We'll certainly try. And again, these numbers tend to move around a little bit, Kathryn. If you look at full year for 2016, it was $20.5 million. And the rhythm and cadence of it in 2016 were as follows: $6.2 million in Q1; $4.6 million in Q2; $1.9 million in Q3; and $7.8 million in Q4. So, again, that was 2016. If we look at the way they rack up right now for 2017, we're thinking it's going to end at about $17.2 million. And we think the spend is going to roll at about $4.2 million in Q1, $3.3 million in Q2, $2 million in Q3, and $7.6 million in Q4.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. I'll hop back in the queue.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. My first question's on the BOLD Act. I read the outline. It looks like a successor to the FAST Act in 2021, but also seems it like suggest a big bump in federal highway spending over the next couple of years. So, I calculated about 45% growth in 2018 going forward and almost 100% from 2021. Are these numbers still as is? I mean, is there any development since the summer? And how is the plan being received by lawmakers? Are you guys trying to link this to tax reform or like a infrastructure bill?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: The short answer is, I think, it's probably going to be more linked to tax reform than it is anything else. I think it's a practical matter. The rollout and the conversation around the BOLD Act is going quite well. And as you would imagine, we're going to talk to a lot of people about this. You're going to have to talk to the administration. Dialogue's underway, you're going to have to talk to people in the House and in the Senate. Perhaps, the most important part of the conversation to those is going to be with users, because while we want to go in and advocate from it, from people who supply infrastructure materials, what's even more important is, when you hear from UPS or FedEx or others, who are actually using the highways, bridges, roads and streets and be effective with this, what I'll tell you, that's been heartening about it is we haven't found anyone who looks at this act and feels like there's some major problem with it. I mean, everybody sees something here or there. And they might want to tweak it in some respect. But if you think back to it, Rohit, the issue traditionally has been, people have said, look, we would like to spend more on infrastructure, just show us how. And I think what's happened with the BOLD Act is most people, who have had the conversations around it have come away with the view that this is innovative, this is different. It attacks it in some ways that are important, and keeps it tied principally to user-type fees. So, if you think back to really the way the BOLD Act is at least built from the ground up. You're looking at several different pieces of it. Number one, the initial notion is you can actually cut the gas tax. And that's something that usually gets some attention on the right to begin with. Then we come back and look at least at putting in a 6.25% highway transportation services tax. It's really going toward those big trucks that are moving goods on the highways. And again, that ties very directly to what we've seen as a tax in air freight in the United States. Then there was a component of it raising the oil spill liability tax to about $6.75 per barrel. And then there was also an aim to make sure that we're getting some degree of funding coming from electric vehicles. Because if you think about the electric vehicles, they're wearing off the roads, the same way that the gasoline or a diesel car does, but they're not paying for that wear and tear. When we look at the different buckets of moneys that roll up from that, and PWC is looking at that for us, as we speak, it is a pretty meaningful contribution. So, again, we think this rolls out with tax reform. The dialog is going well, the information sessions, we believe, are going well. And again, we haven't had anyone, who's looked at this, who feels like they have a fundamental issue with it.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, if you're to be linked to tax reform, you get those revenues. You still need a highway build actually spend them though, right?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, I think, what you're looking to do is to have a mechanism. And it's part of what I referred to in my prepared remarks. We need to double what we're spending from the federal side on infrastructure rate now. My last date that I kind of remember, if you look at what AASHTO has put out, if we can have truly $80 billion going in from the federal level, and then joined by, say, keep it where it is from the state level today with an additional $40 billion, that gets you to about $120 billion worth of annual expenditure. And that $120 billion number is what's generally needed to maintain the system where it is today. So, again, our people want to be overjoyed, but simply maintaining a system that people view as tired, I mean, that's not the perfect answer to it, but it's a lot better than where we are today. And again, part of what you heard me speak of in my prepared remarks was the fact that in some places, contractors are running into not having enough people working for them. And what I will submit to you is right now there is not a lot of reason for contractors to go out and hire more people, because they're busy, they're making money. I think this type of further infrastructure investment is what's needed to have contractors go and hire those extra shifts or bring people into the construction trades as well. So, I think you've got several things that likely hit it. One, the pure investment side helps; two, I think it also puts more people to work in important corridors in the United States. Is that responsive, sir?
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. That's great. Yeah. That's great. I guess, some questions on the changes in reporting. So, the pricing that you guys are reporting now, the average pricing, that's all freight adjusted, straight from the quarry?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. It's not. It's just...
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Straight up.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: ...straight up. There's nothing new in that.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, in the gross profit line, is that all third-party profits, or does that include production costs from your internally-used volumes on the...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: It's all third-party, yeah.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, your incremental gross margin in Aggregates...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah?
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: ...with the changes in the reporting, the historical incrementals came down a bit and then the guidance implies about a 73% incremental in 2017. I think, you guys mentioned production costs, or you have favorable production costs going forward. I know you hedge your energy costs. So, given volumes are going up in 2017. So, I would imagine if incrementals would fade a bit. So, what's going on in the uptick there?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, actually, I think the only thing that you saw for the quarter is you did see a different rhythm and cadence as we went through the quarter on the way the volumes worked on the months. So, if you think about incrementals for the fourth quarter, number one, October, which is usually the industry's busiest month was not our busiest month or the industry's, because of weather and because of Hurricane Matthew. So, then what happens is suddenly November turns into the big month for the quarter. November is obviously going to be effective, because you've got Thanksgiving, and you've got colder weather coming in, in November. And then we had a real winter in portions of December. Those will affect what the incrementals look like for the quarter all by itself. If we pause and look at what the incrementals looked like for the entire organization last year, they were right at the 60%, which is entirely where we thought it would be. And then if you think about the parts of the country that should see stronger this year, Southeast will be stronger, the Mid-Atlantic will continue to be strong. Those will be our friends as we go through and look at incremental margins for the year. Now, in fairness, we did have a hedge in place last year relative to diesel fuel. And the hedge actually was not our friend. So, as we pause and reflect on what did the hedge mean to us for the full year, the hedge actually cost us money last year. We will not have that in place this year. So, as we go into the year, we feel like we're going to have a much better year relative to that piece of the energy. Now, it's possible you're going to see diesel or other things float up a bit. And if it does, we will certainly feel some of that, but my guess is we will not feel it the same way others did, because again, we did have that hedge in place that went the wrong direction on us last year.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. I mean mid-point of the guide is 73%, but longer term, is there a target we should be thinking about?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think you just keep thinking about that 60%. So, if you think back to the way that we've talked about incremental margins, we said, from the peak of the last cycle at 205 million tons to the bottom at 125 million tons. You had an 80 million ton delta from peak to trough, and that's from the Heritage business of Martin Marietta, and our view had always been on the first 40 million tons of recovery in the Heritage business, we should have incrementals on average of 60%. And that's exactly what we're seeing.
Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got you. All right. Great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ward, I'm wondering if you could talk about the M&A pipeline as it stands today. And you folks were big on acquisitions early in the recovery. Can you just remind us by which point should we be thinking about you folks getting sizable acquisitions done, or you'll wait until the next cycle date? Can you just calibrate us around those factors today?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure. I'll certainly try to, Jerry. I mean, the fact is we certainly do want to grow our business. And if you look at the capital priorities that we've been very consistent around, the right acquisitions are at the top of the priority list. We are seeing a good fit of activity right now. I think you're going to see some transactions coming to the marketplace, some of which will be relatively large this year, and some of which will inevitably also be small that we will be interested in growing. We will be interested in making sure that we're putting our business in the right places. I think that's been a big differential item for us here in the fourth quarter in particular. So, you should expect us to look at that. The other thing that I would always encourage you to think about is if you're looking at businesses coming to the marketplace, you need to consider two things, number one, who has the financial capacity to do the transaction? And number two, who has the regulatory capacity to do the transaction? Obviously, I can't talk about individual specific transactions that we believe may be coming to the market this year. But at least, from our view, Jerry, we don't think, there's another business in our sector, in the United States, who's better prepared both from a financial and a regulatory perspective than Martin Marietta is. I think, the other thing that I would remind you is the transactions that we've done, whether it's been TXI, whether it's been River for the Rockies, whether it's been what we've done in Atlanta. The transactions we have done, the synergies that we have pulled from those have all met or exceeded our targets. And we feel confident, if we go through a disciplined process, and I assure you we will, we'll be turning that same type of performance.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And word at the Analyst Day, you spoke about 10% to 15% of your footprint is areas where you're not top three. Any of these acquisitions that you're evaluating today could drive you into that top three position, or is it more about the new markets?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Most of them would tend to be in existing markets. And some of them would be aiming toward markets, where we don't have that one or two position. And you've heard me say before, if we have one or two in 85% of our markets, I would certainly like to see us as an organization, push that up toward 90%. And so I think, we'll have an opportunity to swing at that.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And lastly, I'm wondering, if you could talk about the outlook for net pricing in asphalt and concrete, as net material margins get compressed in any of your businesses?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I think you're going to see it look differently in different parts of the country. The fact is if we look at ready mixed pricing in Colorado right now, Colorado ready mixed pricing is actually very good. We think it will continue to get better, because, for example, we think there may well be aggregate shortages in parts of Colorado this year, which I think can help on ASP, both on the stone. And that's going to feed through and also help on the downstream. We're also seeing what I think are pretty good cement prices in both the Colorado market going up and in the Texas market, which I think will help lift ready mixed pricing as well. There's more room for ready mixed pricing in the Southwest than there is in the Rocky Mountain. And obviously we intend to make sure we're getting good value for those products. So, I think a couple of things are going to happen. I think we will continue to get price. I think the other thing that you will see us do is run those businesses in a very, very efficient fashion. I did mention in my prepared comments that we were seeing some high margin projects fall off, in large part, projects down closer to the Gulf. Now, we're not putting anything into our plan right now relative to some other large projects that are also in the Gulf that may come on during the course of the year. So, Jerry, we'll have to see how that goes. But I do think from a cost perspective, we'll do well. I think from a pricing perspective, we'll do well. And you will see some variation between the Rocky Mountain and the Southwest.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: How are you doing?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: So far, so good, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: I can tell. I was hoping maybe you could summarize the cadence across the quarters in 2017. I know we're going to start the year with a really hard weather compares. And then it sounded like from your summary of highway projects that the FAST Act really is going to kick in, in Q2.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, look, the primary thing that I would really encourage you to do is to take a look at what a five-year average looks like in our business and think about that from a quarterly perspective. Because here's what happened in 2016. 15% of our volume (sic) [gross profit] really occurred in Q1. We're looking at 27% in Q2, 32% in Q3, and 25% in Q4. So, that's a very different play than we would typically see. Ordinarily, you'd see about 7% in the first quarter and closer to 30% in Q2, call it 35% to 40% in Q3, and then 27% in Q4. So, I think part of what I would think about is, is a more second-half-loaded year this year. I think that one is normal; two, it doesn't trouble us at all if that's the way that it goes. And it's usually the more effective way for the business to run. We've said historically for years that the last two weeks in March, either make or break the first quarter. And obviously, last year, it was simply very, very different. Does that help, Craig?
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Yeah. That helps a lot. And is it correct to assume that highway kicks in strong in Q2 based on what you guys can see now?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Craig, you broke on me just a little bit, could you repeat that, please?
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Is it fair to assume that highway kicks in strong in Q2 based on what you can see now?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's entirely right, because keep in mind, there are plenty of DOTs that aren't even going to get people relief to go in under their spec books until at least March 15. And so, in a lot of markets, you won't even see serious mobilization until May. So, that's certainly the right way to think about it, correct.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And both you and Vulcan are indicating that the electivity could tick up in 2017. Is this anything larger than bolt-on deals?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Again, I'm going to have to be careful, because there could be some dialogue. And I never want to go some place that I shouldn't. I think there's the prospect of some deals out there that could be more significant and bolt-on this year. I'll leave it to that, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And last one, for Mag Specialty, you're looking for flat in 2017 because of that capacity?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: In large part, it is. And we'll have to see where steel is. Keep in mind steel was really running at just modestly over 70% capacity last year. Steel gets a little bit better than that. You might see some uptick there. The primary piece of that business that performed exceptionally well last year that pushed into records was the chemical piece of it. So, the dolomitic lime didn't have the same year that chemicals did. If we see steel took up a little bit, you might see something better than that.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Craig. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Hirschman with Stephens. Your line is open.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, Howard and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Blake.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Real quick. You kind of touched on geographic mix and the incremental margins, but is there any geographic or product mix we should be thinking about that's baked into your pricing guide for the year?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, not particularly. I think it's pretty much straight up. As I said, I think you will see better volumes in portions of the Southeast this year. And that does tend to be a higher priced markets than some others. But again, I don't think you're going to see it on an average basis, moving it considerably. So, I wouldn't be concerned about that.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. And just one more. Have you guys seen any notable pick-up in the oil and gas markets yet, or is that still a headwind to your business at this point? Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That's a great question. I'm not going to say, it's a headwind right now, because there are some places, like the Permian is actually quite good right now. And if we look at what's going on, we are seeing greater activity in portions of the shale fields right now. But keep in mind, what I would say to you is normal shale demand for us should be 2 times to 2.5 times the current levels. So, if we go back to 2015, that was the last time oil was staying consistently over $50 a barrel. And if we look at what we sold into the shale fields that year, it was about 3.8 million tons. And if we look at where it was this year, it's about 1.4 million tons. So, I guess, what I would say is, I have a hard time seeing it go really below where it was. I think it's bound bottom. I think something else to keep in mind, I think this is important is to remember that these wells do have a limited lifespan. So, it's not like wells that you might see in the other parts of the world, with maximum production rates really occurring during the first 24 months. So, this is likely to be a phase of our business that if oil stays about $50, we will see it very slowly and very steadily come back over the next couple of years. But again, candidly, I don't think it gets back to that 7.5 million ton number that we were in 2014. But equally, it shouldn't be at 1.4 million tons, which is where we finished in 2016 either.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Ward, can you run us through the major markets in Texas, and what you're seeing there?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, look, we can talk through those. Dallas/Fort Worth just continues to look like a very good market. If we think about Dallas almost in any sector, whether it's infrastructure, non-res or res, it's a market that's in very, very good shape in all them. I think Dallas is one of the country's and world's best markets today. If we go a little bit farther south and go down to San Antonio, that's a market that I think is going to have probably a better 2017 than we had in 2016. I mentioned in one of the earlier answers, we're seeing Highway 1604, some other good work in that marketplace. Keep in mind, you've got San Antonio and Austin that are very much growing together, in many respects. So, from an employment viewpoint and from an infrastructure perspective, that market looks pretty healthy. If we go to Houston, it's fascinating to me, Houston is actually still adding jobs. Clearly, that is the marketplace that has felt the duress from energy more than the others. Keep in mind though, the way our business is built for that Golden Triangle is what's most important to us, the northern portion and central portion of that from a volume perspective is actually more critical than is Houston. So, if you think about our business, are we the aggregate leader in Dallas and Fort Worth? Yes. Are we the ready mixed leader there? Yes. Are we the cement leader there? Yes. In many respects, that's same answer in San Antonio. We go to Houston, we don't have the downstream businesses, we simply have the stone business in that marketplace. So, again, we're looking at what I think is going to be good, steady, solid public work in Houston this year. I think, private's going to feel very similar to what we saw last year. I think that's going to be a slower return. But again, I'm still heartened by the fact that we're seeing job growth in Houston continue to tick up despite the overhang that energy can have in segments of that economy.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: That's great. And then the Gulf Coast energy projects that you referenced that are not baked into guidance, what...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: ...when could those potentially come in?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Those are some big projects. And to give you at least a sense of how I think the rhythm and cadence of some of those could work, so what I would encourage you to think about is there are probably a handful of projects down there, Golden Pass LNG, Trunkline LNG, Port Arthur LNG, Rio Grande LNG, Driftwood LNG. And when you look at those and really a couple of more, the potential project cost on those is about $47 billion. I mean, these again are enormous jobs. If you look at what the aggregates require on those jobs can look like, again, this is what our teams have pulled together, they think it's about 17 million potential tons of aggregates. If you look at what the ready mix may tally up to, it could be about 1.6 million cubic yards. As we look at the timeframe, it looks like they could start anywhere from, let's call it, Q2 of 2017, all the way through 2018. So, if we think back to those large jobs that we saw in South Texas before and how they just rolled off and rolled on over a period of years, I think, that's very much what we're likely to see here as well. And again, to your point Adam, none of this is baked into any guidance that we've given right now. So, if any these come, then we're going to have to come back and revisit the guidance. I mean, part of what we try to do with our guidance this year is, in golfing terms, we're leaving it right in the middle of the fairway. I mean, we're trying to put something out there that we just feel like is very doable.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Okay. And then just I wanted to close the loop on Hurricane Matthew. I think you had guessed maybe that will be 1 million tons. Where did that shakeout?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Let's shake that closer to a deuce. So, probably closer to 2 million tons, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, Ward and Anne. It's PT (49:14) standing in for Timna. How are you?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I'm doing fine, PT (49:17). Hope you are.
Unknown Speaker: I'm good, thanks. Just wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the TxDOT delays, if you could expand on some of the comments you said about the delays occurring there. You talked about what's behind them? Are they administrative delays, or are they labor shortages across Texas? And then for over what timeframe you see them getting solved? And we might see some sort of pickup in terms of TxDOT activity. And then another, like mechanism question I have, the Prop1 and Prop 7 money, is that like a use it or lose it money, or is that there for whenever they can actually get those projects rolling regardless of timing?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. Let's try to go through what we see at TxDOT. Number one, if you think back to what we spoke of during much of last year, there were more administrative delays. So, you had some delays coming from the office and you had some delays coming from what was going on or what wasn't going on relative to right of way utility and the like? Do I think TxDOT has hired a lot of people to address it? Yes. Is it getting considerably and notably better? Yeah. Is it completely cured? No. Is it probably, let's call it, 75% cured? Probably so. If we look at 25 different jobs, taxes DOT project jobs that we have, and if I look at these 25 jobs, you're looking at original bid tons on these of almost 8.3 million tons. You're still looking at tons left to go on these of almost 5 million tons. In other words you've still got about 60-ish percent of the percentage aggs on those jobs going. And of those 25, only 10 jobs were really shipping in earnest. So, what it tells you is exactly, where you're going PT. This ought to be a better story in 2017 than it was in 2016. And, again, TxDOT's looking at about a $7 billion annual letting budget this year. So, again, you're seeing big numbers come behind big numbers with big backlogs. To give you a sense of what we're thinking on Prop 7 for a second, Prop 7, we believe, is going to contribute about $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the time we get to FY 2018. And remember, August is when Texas' fiscal year starts. We think Prop 1 is going to be probably about $380 million in 2018. And that's going to be down from about $800 million in FY 2017. So, the issue isn't going to be, whether they can spend those dollars. They will certainly be able to do that. So, I wouldn't be troubled by or spending anytime doing analysis on the use it or lose it piece of that, because, I don't think that even comes into question.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks, Ward. And then, could you help me out, too, on the FAST Act, right, we've been operating under continuing resolution, I think, through the end of March. Assuming that does get lifted, do you see that providing some momentum on FAST Act projects? And you said that you saw some momentum in projects, but I'm wondering, how that translates into dirt being moved, right. What the lag time is when we can actually see volume impact?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think you'll see good FAST Act activity as soon as we start getting towards the May timeframe. I mean, I don't think you're going to see a lot of dirt being moved in January, February, March. But I think by the time we get to April and surely by the time we get to May, it'll be happening, which is why in large part, I think you hear people across the industry speaking to the notion of more of a back-half-loaded year. And I think that's one of your big reasons, PT (52:56).
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. And then final one from me. I wanted to turn to the private non-res side. I'm wondering if you can help us parse out those big energy projects that you had in 2016 that are rolling off, providing some headwinds in terms of comps for 2017, absent new project wins you just highlighted. And then can you just talk about underlying trends in heavy versus light nonres as well?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. We're seeing a lot of good light nonres, that's probably the bigger headlines. But what I'll tell you is, we're still seeing probably more of the heavy side than you would otherwise think. And it's funny to see how it rolls. For example, we're seeing a lot of big energy-type work going on in the Southeast right now. So, if we're looking at what's going on in Florida and parts of Georgia, it's actually pretty attractive. There's the Big Bend power plant in Tampa. There's the FPL natural gas pipeline that they refer to as Florida Southeast Connection. Savannah River has some things going on as well. And you've also got Georgia power plant, the McManus plant that's going through a demolition, some rebuild after that. So, again, we see fantastic work on the light side. And the way that I'd encourage you to think about that is really do it in a corridor-focused spot in your mind. So, think about the I-25 corridor in the Rockies, think about I-35 in Texas. When you get to the east, really start thinking about 85, 95, Interstate 20, Georgia 400. All of those, we're seeing very good activity. And we're seeing good activity, too, in the Midwestern United States right now. Part of what we've seen there, and this has really been a surprise to me and is part of what gives us even a more robust outlook, I believe, on what could happen on infrastructure. Historically, in places like Indiana and Ohio, the vast majority of our work there has always been public work. And what we saw this past year was a reversal of that. We really saw a considerably more private work in those markets than public. And I think we're going to see a big pick-up in public there as well. But my point to you on that is I don't think the private is going away. And I think it's going to be healthy. I think that the light side will be healthier than the heavy side. But I equally think the heavy side is going to be better than most people believe.
Unknown Speaker: That's helpful. Thanks again, Ward. Appreciate it.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You're welcome. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thanks. Just first off, on the 2 million ton shortfall because of Hurricane Matthew. Is that incorporated in your 2017 volume guidance where you truly assume that, that volume just kind of floats away?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. Look, it won't float away. It's going to come in different ways throughout the year. The other piece that's hard to really gauge, Garik, is how some of the repair behind Matthew is going to work. Because there were some parts of South Carolina and North Carolina that stayed so inundated for so long. It still strikes me as amazing to see what we're doing in Colorado behind the flooding there four years ago. Because Colorado still has flood repair work this year to the tune of $290 million of related projects in that state, that many years out. So what I would say to you, is, one I don't think any work that didn't happen due to Matthew goes away. I think there's work caused by Matthew that's going to come. And I think there is likely to be work that comes from Matthew that's going to come candidly probably for the next 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years in the eastern part of North Carolina and parts of South Carolina.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Just wanted to pick on the West Group pricing. It showed a deceleration in momentum. But you've indicated on the call that you're expecting actually supply shortages in some parts of the West region. So, I'm just wondering how we should think about the trend of pricing out West, as we move into 2017?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think the market in the Western U.S. that clearly has the most room for that is in Colorado, as we've discussed for a while. And we have been focused on that. And as you know, barriers to entry there are very high. And for us to come back and make sure that we can keep those long-term operations in place, it's a tough thing for anybody to do. So, we want to make sure we're recognizing good pricing there. I do think that spot shortages up and down I-25 may/will lead to the opportunity to look at more mid-years in that marketplace than we've seen over the last several years. If you reflect on what has happened to pricing in Dallas over the last several years, keep in mind, that was about 65% of our corporate average here 2.5 years ago. It's still not to our corporate average. So, Garik, I think there's still room for pricing to be had there. And look, I think the pricing story is still very much intact. I don't see anything materially different on it today than I would have said to you a year ago or two years ago. Keep in mind, the metric that we've always said, and frankly, we've been ahead of that metric is you could look at volume growth on a percentage basis and look at ASP growth on a percentage basis and expect them to be relatively close. And what I would remind you is we had a whopping 1.5% volume increase last year. But you saw what happened to pricing, so clearly, pricing got ahead of that. But again, if we think about what our story has been on incremental margins, it hasn't changed and we're doing exactly what we said we would do in incremental margins. And if you think about the story that we've had for years on pricing, I think we're right there. And I don't see any material change there.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Last question is just on Cement. You gave a sales growth outlook of 4% to 10% for 2017. I didn't hear a breakout between volume and price. Could you provide some visibility or some handholding on how you expect those two components to move?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right then. I'll talk a little bit more about price than I'll volume. I'm always sensitive to talk too much about our Cement business with granularity, because we've only got two. And when we talk too much about it, we tell the whole world, including our competitors what's going on with some of that. If we look at pricing where it ended up at the end of the year, on an average, it was right at $102. We're looking adding $8 a ton price increase. We've got some confidence around that, particularly in North Texas. So, we're going to be very focused on that. Again, if you look at the way Cement worked overall in Texas last year, cement shipments were modestly down across the state. Ours were actually modestly up, so we feel pretty good about where that's going this year as well. The other thing that I would remind you on Cement, because I think volume is going to clearly be an issue that will be even more helpful on price going forward. I mean, clearly, people believe Texas is going to be better in 2017 than it was in 2016, and we agree. PCA actually believes Texas is going to better in 2018 than it's going to be in 2017. So, we think we've got a forecast on Cement in Texas. PCA is saying up 3% in 2017. PCA is saying up 5% in 2018. So, if you've got those types of numbers up, and you still have a marketplace there that, I believe, has room on price, hopefully, directionally that gives you a sense of how we were thinking about it, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah, it does. Thank you very much, and best of luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, there. Thank you guys for taking my question.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Stanley.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A question for you guys. How should we think about inventories on the ground, whether it's by product class, location? And what I'm thinking about more is just the ability from a manufacturing perspective or a production perspective to kind of deliver a lot of these larger projects that you guys have underway?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Here is what I would say to you, we are not going to have a problem delivering base to people. I mean that's probably the safest way to think of it. Because if you think back to the downturn, Stanley, so much of what was happening was you were having maintenance and repair works, so you're seeing more clean stone go out than you were seeing base project going up, because you weren't dealing with new projects. We do believe the FAST Act and the state initiatives will drive not just in 2017, but probably 2017, 2018, 2019, probably into 2020 more new projects than we've seen. And they'll utilize a disproportionate amount of base. So, I don't think there are issues there. I don't think in the majority of markets, but I think in some markets, you might be in a position to see some clean stone shortages this year. And I mentioned the fact that we might see some of that in Colorado. And I can tell you there are locations today that we are working to crush and put stone on the ground at times of the year that we typically wouldn't. And that gives you a good sense of how much we feel like might be coming our way. So, I think at the end of it, Stanley, there may be some pocket shortages. I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing in all respects. I do believe also that if there are significant issues not in given markets, but across the United States on whether demand can be met, it's going to be more of a contractor issue, as opposed to a producer issue. And that goes back to the comment that I made in one of the earlier questions. I do think one of the things that can really benefit the United States if we see a new transportation and tax initiative that puts more money to the sector is you'll see more people come into it, and the ability for the contracting community to execute on jobs will be amped up pretty considerably. Does that help?
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: It absolutely does. And one other thing. So, CapEx another good year in terms of spending.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you highlight some of the growth initiatives you guys have underway just to kind of help us frame out that, as we're looking in longer term for the business?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, a couple of things. One, we have had an acceleration of timing to complete the Highway 34 Rock & Rail project. As you recall, that's in Weld County. It's in north of Denver, because we want to make sure that we're meeting demand there. So, we'd like to be able to move that from what would have been – 2020 back into 2018, so we're accelerating that. If we're looking at the way that we really spent money this last year, I want to say, $41 million went into growth projects, $145 million went into mobile, about $60 million on land, and then plant replacement at about $114 million. Then you've got just a host of others. But that gives your sense of really how we're looking at this right now. So, if you look at those two things, you're seeing a disproportion spend on mobile, which makes good sense. That's incredibly safe capital. Because, if you got one market that's picking up and one market, that's slowing. The beautiful thing about mobile equipment is it's mobile. And you move it from the slower market to the more robust market. The other thing that we saw towards the end of the year is we had some OEMs, who were looking to move some inventory. And the simple fact is, we were able to be in a place to get an awfully good deal at the right time of year. So, what I believe, we did relative to CapEx is almost in keeping with conservation I was having earlier with respect to M&A. And that is we had the balance sheet, and we had the moment, and we seized the moment. So, if you go back and think about the capital priorities that we have, keep in mind organic growth in running the business from that perspective is really a high one. And making sure we're taking down our cost of goods sold is an important one for us. So, the short answer is, I think, we'll continue to invest capitally on a percentage basis, the same way that I've just discussed with you. And I do think this is a year that we might see even some enhanced opportunities.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And the last for me, in terms of the pricing outlook. To hit those numbers, is that requiring any unusual amount of mid-year price increases? Is it requiring mid-year price increases, or how do we think about the framework with that as the year's going to unfold?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Stanley, I don't know if you ever saw the movie Back to School, but Rodney Danger did the Triple Lindy in that, do you remember? Yeah, there's no Triple Lindy in this one. This one's just pretty much straight up. No, we've got a lot of conviction around the price of where we've got it right now. I don't think, there's any downside in what we put out to you in pricing.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Well, thank you guys, and best of luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Chen with Alembic Global Partners. Your line is open.
Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hey, guys. You've got to most of my questions. So, thank you for that. Just a quick housekeeping item. Again, you talked a little bit about sort of what your M&A outlook might be. Could you just go over your capital allocation priorities?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I'll tell you what, Anne is here, and she is doing her best Kathleen Turner imitation today. So, let me let her walk through that for you.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Ward.
Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Good Kathleen Turner.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Oh, my gosh.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Okay. Go to Whitney (01:07:02) when this is over.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Oh, my gosh. Our capital allocation priorities are really the first, being acquisitions that can bring value in the right quarters of growth. Organic capital investment, maintaining a sustainable meaningful dividend, which as a reminder, we increased our dividend in the third quarter of last year. And then it's return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. And that capital allocation priority hasn't changed.
Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: That's great. Thank you so much, guys. I'll jump back into the – oh, sorry, didn't mean to take off.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: So, if you're wondering if we're ready to fight sick, we are.
Nicholas K. Chen - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: That's great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you again for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. In sum, we're pleased that our record setting performance was achieved due to the important characteristics that differentiate Martin Marietta: our safety commitment; our strategically positioned assets in many of the nation's fastest growing regions; our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products; and our relentless focus on cost containment. Importantly, our strong performance throughout the slow and steady economic recovery demonstrates the powerful earnings potential of our business. We're confident that the successful execution of our strategic approach of developing leading market positions, along high-growth corridors, possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics will continue to generate top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. Rest assured, we'll continue to focus on the operations of the company, as well as the best practices needed not only to sustain Martin Marietta as a premier aggregates company, but continue our transformation into one of the world's best companies. We look forward to discussing our first quarter results with you in May. Until then, thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Q3 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. You may begin.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws, in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also as a remainder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, on our website, and in our SEC filings. As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional, record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value. In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta: our commitment to safety; our strategically positioned assets placed amidst, geographically, in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions; our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products; and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of this led to record net sales of $1.038 billion, and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior-year third quarter. Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow of nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization – or EBITDA – for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016, EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015. Of moment, we believe we're in a more durable construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both grow top-line revenues, further increased profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior-year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead to the West Group's 14% increase in aggregate average selling price. Consistent with our expectations, aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior-year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5% respectively. The ready mixed concrete business, with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on a per-cubic-yard basis. Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volume headwinds. Consistent with our commentary at the 2016 half-year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas; declines in railroad ballast shipments; abnormally wet weather in many markets; and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials. For comparative purposes, it's important to remember the third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important markets such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter of 2015, as best illustrated on the maps on slide five. These weather events, together with the second quarter's significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas, making heavyside construction activities oftentimes impossible. This circumstance was exacerbated on the eastern seaboard of the United States in October, as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly 1 billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the Bahamas, with the storm's eyewall literally passing pass through our Freeport operation. While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages, and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our effected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams. As is typical of natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses, and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post-disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina. The personal impact of these storms on our employees and communities is not lost on us. In our home state of North Carolina alone, there are many who continued to experience the devastating effects of flooding. In fact, 34 counties have received disaster declarations for public assistance, and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina Counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remained in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Matthew, from the Caribbean through to the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials, and support those who need it so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew. Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we move quickly to remedy situations as best as we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is: temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth of our business. This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including that employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past three years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. Additionally many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much-needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations. In addition to improvements in infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in non-residential growth, despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand, and the omnipresent varying interpretations of construction start data. For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in non-residential construction growth, with Atlanta not far behind, ranked number four. Similarly, we're particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investment, notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle. The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing, but nonetheless predictable, evolution in many cities throughout the United States. Specifically, there is an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase in more entry-level, single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression, as multi-family vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes, and thus encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work. By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than is multi-family construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Austin, just to name a few. Furthermore, while all of the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculative building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well-positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity. The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in Heritage net sales. Including the results from a July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large ongoing energy-related projects in Texas. Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Our aggregates-related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points. For the third quarter, the cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. Excluding the results of the divested California cement business from the prior-year quarter, which provides a same-on-same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion in the business's gross margin to nearly 50%. The 2015 impact of the now-divested California cement operations is detailed on slide seven. The business's third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance costs. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million. The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage costs led to a gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior-year quarter. Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerately above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line, as well, as a diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million, compared with $179 million in the prior-year quarter. Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the nine months ended September 30 compared with the prior-year period. Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity, as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near-term, and long-term strategy. That said, we're also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program, as of September 30, we've returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5 times to 1.9 times at September 30. At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million. In today's earnings release, we updated our full-year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project- and weather-related delays, most notably in the southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to cement guidance specifically reflect a higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready mix concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas. Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year, and record consolidated pre-tax profitability. We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized, and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas. As we look forward to the final two months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third-party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth, while Texas ranks third, Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge NPCA, which forecasts growth in construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of non-residential construction projects and tends to lead non-residential construction spending by one full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery. The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by a decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston, and New York. Growth in the entry-level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. Dodge currently forecasts single-family starts to increase 7% in 2016, followed by 9% growth in 2017, as compared to a multi-family decline of 5% and 2% respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world class safety, ethical conduct, operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction, and sustainability. By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, Ward and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: How are you doing, Trey?
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hi, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Doing well. You know, the weather's been definitely a challenge for your guys this year, and Ward, you mentioned Hurricane Matthew obviously coming through some of your key markets. Can – and that you have tried to address that in your guidance. Could you, could you talk about kind of how we should be framing that up for the 4Q? What the impact that could have had on the fourth quarter, understanding that October is a very important month for the quarter? Just how that hurricane's impacting you in the guidance?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure, Trey. We'll try to wrap that up for you. As I said, we had about 1 billion gallons of water that founds its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches, and perhaps even more remarkably, we've removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry was hit with that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, worked its way up at East Coast. Looking at precise volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out, but here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by this storm, what we typically see per traditional work down here (21:06) volumes that could be going in those markets of about 200,000 tons. So if we're starting the clock on October 6, when Matthew hit the Bahamas – and consider there are a lot of communities in Eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with storm and its aftereffects – the range of volumes could be in that 2 million ton-ish type of framework. And again, this represents about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we tried to look at that, sort out what we believe the effect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it. You raised a very good point, and that is, October's an important month. It's an important month for the aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta, because typically you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today. It's temperate, it's dry. And clearly Mathew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe, but that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely that was helpful. And then we've definitely been seeing volatility in non-res starts recently. Could you talk about how you look at this, how you look at the starts data, the choppiness we've been seeing there this year? And what that means for you, as we move into the next year in your geographic markets?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure, I'll try to. I mean, we look at the starts too, and what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts are – actually the score is kept on those. Because the stats, as you know, typically include a 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores that construction spending covers a period of months or years after the start. So here's what happens with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there were around 13 different projects across the United States valued at a $1 billion or more. So there was a $9 billion L&G project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana, and I think there were two different office starts in New York, at in excess of $3.5 billion. By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look at 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period, as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there are only 4 valued at a $1 billion or more. But here's what happens. As 2016 progressed, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking in 2016, total construction starts in 2016 are estimated to be up 1% to, let's call it $676 billion. But they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017. So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we are not concerned about what we see this year; and number two, as we're looking at what the third-party forecasters are saying, relative to non-res next year; again, that's part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Last one from me. I know you guys aren't getting into a lot of detail here on 2017, but it does sound like you're looking for all of your end-markets to be up next year. Can you talk about maybe high level, how we should be thinking about things as far as relative strength geographically, and also markets that might be more challenging next year for you? And then kind of with that, the timing of the FAST Act and then the tough comps in 1Q, how the – how we should be thinking about kind of the cadence as we look into next year? Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Right, thank you, Trey. I'd tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do in this call, and try to give you an overview what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said, and here's what I'd say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year. Equally, people need to remember the construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather on a compared basis last year – or this year in Q1, which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too; in a lot of years, the last two weeks of March either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year. If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east, and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good. Private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DoT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different projects. The only real headwind in this division are ballast (26:38) volumes. And we've talked about that, and clearly they have been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. Their profitability outlook, I think, is excellent; their ready mix business is performing at a very high level, as is their paving business. One thing that I think is important to say about that business is, I think they are in a relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think they're even in the seventh innings stretch yet in Colorado. Midwest, and really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, this has absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low, and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely on all cylinders. As we go into 2017, we think there'll be more DOT money flowing through. We think there is a continuing positive non-res outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues. And the other thing that we're seeing, and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago but you're going to hear about it more, I think, for the next several years, it's a reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very, very aggregates-intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is, they have a very healthy residential market. So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. I mean, to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000, I mean that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 years or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would have absolutely, positively followed ag, and that's not what it's doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado, I think it's probably in a sixth- inning-type phase. The Southwest in cement, you've really got a divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong; we talked about the fact that res is leading the nation, as is non-res. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio – and San Antonio, and what you're seeing in pricing there, to us, is a predictable, but a very good story. I think one of the issues that they are going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work. And I'm not talking about us, I'm talking more about contractors, subcontractors, materials suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes, which were very high coming into this year, are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year. I think if you get a little bit farther south in Texas, clearly Houston is feeling the effect of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember, as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas and San Antonio and Austin, about 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's really not the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a very healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade, and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT. Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi. Because the Mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina, is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace. It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado, today, a handful of years after 500-year-event flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of the type of investment I think we're likely to see, not for a year or two, but maybe for the better part of a decade in parts of Eastern North Carolina. There were considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways. From our perspective, we think there's going to have to be a lot of maintenance and repair there. As we look at the Southeast in Georgia and Florida, those are two of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market, and part of what we're seeing is we believe we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was suffering from about six months' worth of delays this year. So again, if we're looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that one's probably in the third or fourth inning. And finally, in the Mid-East, which is really what we have in Indianapolis and Ohio and West Virginia, you know what? In Ohio and West Virginia it's having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready mix concrete work in that market than we've seen for a while. And we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space in that marketplace as well. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings, I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective. But that gives you your march, literally from East to West – or West to East, I suppose – and a sense on where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's an important march.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Absolutely, and thank you for all the detail and insight. There, Ward. It's very helpful as always.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: All right, Trey, you take care.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: You too.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. A two-part Texas question. First, if you could give a little bit more color on your Central Texas acquisition. And then second, could you just maybe give more color on project delays that you discussed in the quarter, how much do you believe were driven more by weather, or sheer project size, so megaproject size, or is there something else we should take into consideration for those project delays in Texas? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk a little about the acquisition that we made. We purchased the remaining portion of Ratliff Ready-Mix. Ratliff was a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with, so this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they've got 23 plants, and really it's in that golden triangle, Kathryn. It's on the I-35 and the I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at it, it's really in a couple of tranches. You're looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and College Station. So this actually fits an important niche for us in Texas. As we come back to your question on delays, and again our primary delays are going to be in North Texas, as you may recall, in Q2, at half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5-million-ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons had shipped against that backlog. What I would tell you is, again, in Q3 there was very limited activity on those projects, but we did start to see some movement later in the quarter. I mean, here's one way to think of it, back to your question with more color. North Texas project delays, we've got 20 major projects there in the backlog, one dating back – get this, Kathryn – to the fall of 2012. Four finally started in September of 2016 and three began in October of 2016. Eight of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons. The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's a moment, and we think that's a moment because I think there's a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with are administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement on that in 2017. As I've said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state DOTs, but it has been relative to Texas. So, I've tried to help you on Ratliff, and give you the additional color in North Texas in particular. Is that responsive, Kathryn?
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yes, it does help. Just the one follow-up, and you, I believe you answered it in a previous Q&A, but we were thinking about Hurricane Matthew, how to frame it. Really wanted to get a better sense of similarities or differences of your experience in the Colorado; obviously there's a lot flooding in Matthew, but is there something that was unique about Colorado that – so Matthew impact wouldn't necessarily be as good as of a proxy?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what? Not particularly. In fact, what I will tell you is, the flooding hit the Rockies then it had someplace to flow.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: The difference is this: flooding was coming back in rivers, and it was – so you had rivers backing up in Eastern North Carolina. And you had rain in Western North Carolina fighting its way to the east. And it simply stayed there. And it stayed there for a very long time. As I said in my commentary, we're going to go into the holiday season and still have people living in shelters in Eastern North Carolina. So my sense is, Kathryn, that from an impact and dollar and cents perspective going forward, it's likely to be more impactful in Eastern North Carolina than it was in Colorado.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Helpful. Just for your cement business, and understanding it's primarily Texas business, but could you – there've been some, a few changes in the competitive marketplace in Texas. How has this impacted pricing in the near-term? How will it impact it in the mid-term? And any other color on your thoughts on overall capacity utilization as we look forward to 2017 and 2018?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think that's what I would say is severalfold, Kathryn. As we look at that Texas market, you still have a market that's broadly sold out. So I mean, let's start with the notion that you still don't have enough domestic production to meet domestic needs. Clearly there has been some sort of transaction. South Texas at Argos we understand is not importing material into Houston any more. At the same time, what I will tell you, Kathryn, is we see two very different things, and back to your point, our Texas cement business isn't primarily in Texas, it's wholly in Texas. So that's all they have.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What we're seeing in Midlothian is a very healthy market. And what we're seeing there relative to volumes and what we're seeing relative to price, is it's a pretty good place. Volumes and price at Hunter have been more challenged, and at the same time what we have certainly spoken to our customers about is an $8 a ton price increase next year. And we have some confidence around that. So that's where we are looking in that marketplace for next year. And we feel good about where we are, Kathryn.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. And I'm going to get out of Texas, and maybe hit another region. Just would love to get a little bit more color on the primary drivers for your Mid-American group margin expansion?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: What's happening there is we're just getting some more volume, Kathryn. I mean, their cost structure is good, but they are simply getting more volume. Remember North Carolina lost about 40% of its volume from peak to trough. So what's happening is you've got a Charlotte market that's relatively healthy; you've got a Charleston, South Carolina market that's relatively healthy; you've got a Raleigh market that's getting healthier; and we're seeing more infrastructure work in the Triad than we've seen for years. So, when you are continuing to get good pricing in that marketplace – and in large part that's what we're seeing – and you're adding even incremental volume to it, it's very powerful. That goes back to that notion, Kathryn, as the East begins to recover, it's disproportionately impactful to our business. The Southeast is important in that; candidly, portions of the Mid-Atlantic are even more important in that.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: And Kathryn, just you give some context, you saw that aggregates volume was down for the whole quarter for the company as a whole, we actually saw volume activity up in double digits in those areas of the Mid-Atlantic.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Hello, Jim (sic) [Jerry] (40:02).
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ward, can you talk about the price increases, actions that you announced to the market or thinking about for aggregates for 2017? You in the past have spoken about the need to structurally reprice the markets in Colorado, Texas and Florida, and I'm wondering if you've announced significant price increases to kick off in 2017 on that path?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know what, we'll give you much better guidance on that when we come out in February with full-year results and give you a real forecast for 2017 at that time. I think what you've heard us say in the past, though, is a completely fair way for you to think about it. And by that I mean, will you see consistent good pricing across the enterprise? Yes. Will you see the Western United States on a percentage basis outperform at East? Yeah, I think you will. And will we continue to see Colorado get better? I think, the answer to that is yes. And part of what, candidly, I loved about this last quarter, that's exactly what you saw. I mean those are commentary – very constant views that we've been offering for a couple of years. And as you'll recall, we said probably two years ago, guys, it's coming in Colorado, just give it time. And here you finally saw it in this quarter. So what I would say is we'll give you more color on that in February, but if you just stick with that general theme, you're going to be fine.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And in terms of guidance for the year for the aggregates product line, just to make sure I understand your comment around cadence forward, so you mentioned the tough compare in the first quarter of 2017. I think the implied guidance for fourth quarter volumes is year-over-year growth, so it sounds like we've lapped a bunch of the weather headwinds, and I just want to confirm that that triangulation of the path is correct. So fourth quarter volumes up year-over-year, and then we'll see how the first quarter plays out, but the comps are tough?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Jerry, I think you got it.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And in terms of the downstream business, you had a really nice positive revision for to gross profit outlook for the year. A chunk of that I would imagine was acquisition, but can you talk about the organic improvement in unit margins, and what are the drivers?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: You know, what I would say is clearly some of that's going to be acquisition, but most of it's what we're doing with our internal business. And here is the way that's working, Jerry. I mean, our asphalt and paving business in Colorado is a very good business, and they continue to see nice year-over-year improvement in that marketplace. Our ready mix concrete business in Colorado is a good, solid, mature ready mix concrete business. Here's what's happening. We said that you should expect our ready mix concrete business in Texas to continue to get better. And over time, you should see it performing the way that we're seeing our business in Colorado perform, and if you look at that business, that's what's happening. The cost structure's better, we're seeing much better pricing activity in that business, and here's the other piece that's helping there. You're seeing some headwinds in aggregate volume because you've got more brand new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils. But when you've got concrete, and some other gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually go. So here's the odd thing, we were seeing internal aggregates to our ready mixed business actually better in third quarter. We're seeing stone going down on road projects coming down in the third quarter, which tells me the underlying business is good, but what you're seeing in Q3 on the downstream businesses is just the better performance that we were expecting to see.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a record quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Craig.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Just back TxDOT a little bit, because it does move a lot of your volume around. At this point, it sounds like they're gearing back up, but do you have enough visibility to say that Q2 volume really accelerates, or how should we look at that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I guess what I would say is this. I mean, we're looking right now at a record backlog in Texas, and TxDOT has committed to at least $66 billion over the next 10 years. So keep in mind, Craig, even when Prop 1 was at its absolute peak, spending from 2010 to 2015, those fiscal years for Texas, was trending at about $5.2 billion. If we're looking at it right now, Prop 1 and Prop 7 should provide about $2.5 billion by 2018, rising to $3.1 billion by 2021. So if we're sitting here right now, we're looking at what we feel like is going to be probably a plus-$7 billion program in 2017, very healthy on the out years, going into the year with some of the largest backlogs that we've ever had. So, again, as we're looking at TxDOT and looking at a marketplace that 50% of our volume finds its way into infrastructure, we feel very confident, both in the near term and the long term there. I've got to believe Texas DOT is going to find its way through these administrative delays, so that's one reason I wanted to give the metric that I did early in the dialogue about the fact that they've hired several hundred more employees.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yes, and Craig, if you take a look at those big projects, I mean, as Ward indicated, several of them started late in September, some more started in October, and based on our conversations with the Texas DOT, if you look into 2017, looks like a pretty uniform distribution of those projects happening throughout the various quarters of next year.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then on a broader note, the FAST Act spending across your markets, that's supposed to kick in Q2?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I'm sorry. Say that first part again, Craig, I didn't hear you.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: How do – when will the FAST Act spending kick in across all of your markets?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think by the time we get to half-year next year, FAST Act ought to be pretty well flowing through all these markets. And again, I think you need to remember too, there are going to a number of these markets, for example you're going to see better spend in Georgia next year, you're going to see better spend in Iowa next year, you're going to see probably modestly better spend in Indiana next year, probably modestly better in North Carolina next year, still a record spend in Florida next year. So I think by the time we get to half-year next year, you're going to have a pretty good effect from both the federal and the state side in almost all relevant geographic markets.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And just a last quick question. Ballast, is it still down like 20% type decline?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Ballast is still down. I mean, if we look at where ballast is, I mean clearly the Class 1 railroads, with what they are not moving relative to energy, is pretty considerably off. And what I would say is, the railroads have done what you would expect any major industrial company to do. And that is, they pulled back on maintenance and repair, and at the end of the day, you can only do that for so long. And what I would say as well is we're not going to see a host of other people come in and put quarries on rail to meet that demand. We're going to be there, we're going to be ready for it, they are very good customers of ours, we want to supply their needs, and they are going to have some needs. But from a ballast perspective right now, it is one the more challenged areas of our business. I guess, the good news is, it's one of the smaller areas of our business.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot guys.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Absolutely.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: The first one is, back on to Texas, could you break out your estimate of the tonnage impact of the weather, versus the delayed projects? And on Texas, you mentioned the – they have hired significant number of people, but do you think they've hired enough to catch up on the announced projects, or do you think they – that there's probably still more to go?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I think they've probably hired what they need to do to try to catch up. At the same time, I'm not completely inside baseball, so we're going to have to see what happens...
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Well, we also know – we also know that they have a budget request for even more hires. So it'll be interesting to see how that gets resolved.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: But...
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: But back to your question. If we're looking at really what we're looking at relative to headwinds in Texas, I mean, clearly, you've got energy sector headwinds that probably – this isn't just Texas, this is beyond that – probably 700,000 tons that are attributable to that. We mentioned earlier in the year that we were doing a transition from New Braunfels Quarry over to what will eventually be our Hunter Aggregates Facility, that's probably 600,000 tons. And if we're looking at just pure ballast sector as well, that's probably another 300,000. And if we're looking at other headwinds and tailwinds, and this is principally answering your question, what does TxDOT Weather mean? It probably means, about a 1.2 million, relative to tonnage. So I think that probably gives you a pretty good bridge.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, that helps. And then just lastly, have you seen any rebound in the energy sector, as oil prices have started to come back, or is it you still think it's going to be lackluster for the time being?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: We have not seen a remarkable snapback yet, but what's remarkable to me is you do see more just early, early, early activity, once it starts peaking over $50. I can tell you the energy companies are really hoping it gets to about $65. I think if you see oil get to that $65 level, you're going to see pretty good activity there. So in the back of our mind, that's really a marker that we have. But if I told you we were seeing much right now, that wouldn't be correct.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Perfect. That helps. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, James.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you're thinking about incremental margins going into 2017. Clearly had strong performance here in the third quarter. How sustainable is this above 60% trend that you've been delivering on? And as you look at the different cost buckets moving forward, what are you seeing?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: So Garik, are you saying that the 90% worked pretty well?
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I guess what I would say, Garik, is what we've talked about was averages, right? And we said, when we saw our volume fall 80 million tons, we thought that for the first 40 million tons of recovery in our Heritage business, we would see it on average at 60% incremental margin. And clearly that's what we're seeing. We're seeing it plus that. Here's what's happening. You are getting the incremental margin boost because you're seeing a shift to more in the East. And again, here I've got something that we've been very transparent on, and we've spoken about for years. Because we said, we couldn't even hit the 60% all by itself, if we were just counting on a Western recovery all by itself. So if you believe, as I do, that we are in early innings in the Southeast, and in relative early innings in the Mid-Atlantic, then I think we're going to be certainly above that target that we've said. Now, do I think we're going to show up every quarter with 90%. I'd like to say that I thought we would, but I think that would be a little bit ambitious, so I'm not encouraging you to go and model that. But again, I think if you just come back, think about that average on 60%, and keep in mind, pricing's probably doing better than what we thought it was going to do as we went through this cycle, so maybe last a little bit longer than we thought it would when we said that first 40 million tons. So I would tell you, it has the capacity to endure. I think geographic mix is our friend. Clearly pricing has been our friend, and our cost profile is very attractive. So I think we remain pretty resilient around that.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Garik, just to give you some color on capacity, if you look at those, kind of the Southeastern markets, those are just barely ticking above 50% of prior period peaks, although pricing there is still incredibly strong. And then if you look at – through the Carolinas, those markets are probably between the 65% and 70% of prior peak, so they still have some of that operating leverage room to go. And again, pricing's, just like the quarter, pricing just falls directly through.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah. So, if we think about potential buckets of inflation for next year, whether it's labor or energy cost, the message is that the leverage plus the pricing should more than offset to continue...?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah, Garik, that should be. I don't think there is anything up that's going to remarkable. And keep in mind, in fairness energy has been the industry's friend for the last several years. I think energy is going to continue, on a compared basis, to be the industry's friend. When we get to that point that energy is not the industry's friend, what you'll recall is historically, energy has been an impetus for pricing as well. So I don't see anything that I would think would be rocking your model from a material perspective on inputs next year.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: So the one thing I would say that potentially could be deflationary as we move into next year, is we have made some good investment in mobile equipment to help with the repair and maintenance costs on the business, and are beginning to see trends of that – of decline in the per-ton cost of repair and maintenance. So I think we would expect to see some future benefit into that, into 2017, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-up question, just wanted to clarify on volume. If we look at the 2016 volume guidance for aggregates, backing into a 4Q projection of about 3% to 7% volume growth, just want to be clear that this does incorporate the initial impact from Hurricane Matthew. There's been a lot of discussion about the event on the call today, recognizing it happened in October, which is the most important month of the quarter. So I just want to make sure...
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: ...that my facts and figures are correct?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Your facts and figures are correct.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Ward, Anne, thank you guys for taking my question. A quick question on the pricing side, is there a way to kind of split out how much of that was mix, be it either regional or product mix, kind of when we're thinking about just the pricing environment overall?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I'll tell you, we look at that very carefully every quarter, and I'm delighted to tell you that whatever the number was, it was immaterial. So what you're seeing tends to be what it does now.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, good news. And this is kind of more of a hypothetical, but lots of discussion out there now about some form of fiscal stimulus. To the extent that whoever becomes President could get something passed, let's say in the first 100 days, what would be a realistic sort of timeframe to where projects would start moving forward, and we start to – you all would start to see volumes as a result of that?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: That's hard to say. I mean, I think you could go back over a usual highway bill and look at the rhythm and cadence on that, and say it takes probably 18 months for something really to start finding its way in a meaningful fashion. So I wouldn't expect it to be immediate, but I would expect it to be pretty impactful to our business, if that happens. I think one of the big issues that we need to keep in mind is, looking at employment across the United States and sorting out those states that even when you put the stimulus in, who's going to be able to put workers out there who can put that down? And the good news is, there are some Martin Marietta states where we think that can very much happen right now. But here's part of what what's different, I think it's interesting, Stanley, and it's a clear recurring theme that we're hearing from contractors, and that is, they're busy. And they haven't gone and hired a bunch of new people to come to work for them, because they're busy. If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerate a project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But I think there are a lot of contractors, who're just as busy as they want to be. They're making good money, they don't want to overextend their businesses, and if they have can good multi-year backlogs and just continue to work that in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, yeah, I think they're pretty pleased with that. And if you're seeing what we did in this quarter with down volume, if we see just good, steady slow volume in this business, based on the enterprise that we've built, I think it's very powerful. And I think additional stimulus from whoever the next President is could be very powerful in this business. Do I think it's a 2017 event? No. Do I think it could be a mid-2018 event? Yeah, probably so.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, guys. Thank you very much, and the best of luck.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Hi, good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon, Brent. How are you?
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: I'm doing well. Thanks. You made an – Ward, you made an interesting reference to single-family versus multi-family, and kind of differences in concrete intensity, I think, particularly coming down to subdivisions. And obviously seeing that dynamic shift on a national basis, but was kind of thinking about your larger MSAs, Dallas, Denver, Atlanta, so on, are you seeing that dynamic develop at an equivalent pace, or even more?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No, we are. But here's the way I would think about it if I were you, Brent, the West has already seen that happen, to a degree much more than the East has. So in my prepared commentary I think I mentioned Austin as one of those. But what you heard was then also somebody said Atlanta, and I said Charlotte, and I said places like Raleigh. So now we're seeing the Eastern United States go through that same transition, frankly, that we saw the Western U.S. doing 18 or 24 months ago. So directly to your point, if we're building a multifamily facility, really it's going to take stone on the base and concrete that's going to go on the pads. If we see new subdivision work, until those roads and streets are accepted by a local municipality for maintenance, everything that we're selling on the roads, everything that we're selling on the sidewalks, everything that we're selling on the utilities, everything that we're selling on the lot, counts as residential. So when we see that type of turn hitting a city like Charlotte right now, and Atlanta right now, and Charlotte right now – by the way, all still in very early stages of that – it is much more aggregate-intensive, and we think it's much more powerful.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Sure. No, it is interesting. On Georgia, I didn't catch from your comments that you had necessarily seen much of an effect from infrastructure work yet, most of the growth was coming from some of the other sectors. Is that accurate?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: I believe the best is yet to come in that state. Remember a couple of things here. One, they had the tax initiative that they referred to as TSPLOST that really ended up hitting three different geographic areas in South Georgia several years ago, which has given that part of the state a good, steady infrastructure ride. What we believe is going to happen is, with the new $900 million that came through the House bill last year, we're going to see more overall Georgia DOT work, it's going to be more impactful in 2017 than it was in 2016 – and by the way, that's what we thought 2016 was going to be – and we think we're likely to see more of that in the early phases in North Georgia, read Atlanta, than in South Georgia. So I think your take is right, Brent.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then, it's obviously hard to detect any concern from you about Texas. You just did another deal in the market, it looks like, and I guess the question is, do you like the size of the business or platform you have there today? Do you want to be careful about the proportion of exposure you have to Texas, and kind of still look for some more fillers like the one you just did?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. I guess what I would say is, we're looking to grow our business in places that we have good, leading positions on, and we can do value-enhancing acquisitions. So the one that we just finished in Texas was really one that, given the JV status, we were going to do anyway. But keep in mind, Stanley, it fits entirely – I meant Brent – it fits entirely in that marketplace that means a lot to us, and that's the golden triangle. So where we bought that business is exactly where our strategic plan dictates that we would buy it. The other thing that I would tell you is, if you're looking at Texas and how that stake's going to grow between now and 2050, you're going to have 70% of the population in Texas living in the golden triangle. And remember, when you're looking at that, you're looking at a space that's roughly the size of Pennsylvania anyway. And we will have, and we do have, the leading position in that marketplace. That said, do we want to grow in the Eastern U.S.? You bet, we do. Are we looking at transactions potentially there? We certainly are. Do we think we did the right transaction in Central Texas and North Texas with Ratliff? We believe we did.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: And Brent, I do think, as we indicated earlier, the activity, the growth we're beginning to see in the early innings, where I think you characterized it as in the third or fourth inning, coming into the Carolinas, as we see the volumes come back there, I think the mix of the business actually will rationalize out a little bit more than the skew that it has been a little bit more to Texas, just simply because the Southeast and Carolinas have been down so long. So that's part of what I think will be the balancing and diversification of our model.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Does that help, Brent?
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Absolutely. Thanks so much, and best of luck here closing out the year.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Catch you soon.
Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you and our next question come from the line of Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thank you very much. Yeah, just three quick questions, if I could, from me. First one just to help with the model building. Ratliff was a joint venture. Were you consolidating half of the 1.1 million cubic yards, or was it off not being consolidated at all beforehand? Secondly, Ward, I think when you talked about the reduction in guidance in the cement business, you talked about the higher proportion of internal sales. I would've thought you kind of transferred those across at market price, or am I misunderstanding your point you were making there? So maybe just a bit more explanation on that point. And then, there were no share buybacks in the quarter. Maybe you're able to comment on why that might have been the case, given what the share prices did? Was it because you thought you may have to reduce the guidance, and therefore it wasn't appropriate to do it? You able to say anything on that? Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Mike, I'll try to say something on the all three of those, how about that? Here's what I would on the Ratliff piece, no we weren't consolidating anything.
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. it was a nonconsolidated entity, and all of its tonnage would've been included in external tons, so then now they've included in internal tons.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Relative to transfer ...
Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Relative to transfer pricing, Mike, your question, we transfer at market. So I can answer that directly to you. And relative to the share buybacks, what I can tell you is, we have this bad habit, we joke about it, we try to do exactly what we say we're going to do. And if you think back to what we said, we wanted to maintain that debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times, but we've also said that our first priority are doing the right transactions. So if you look at where we ended the quarter, and if you look at the transaction that we did, and if you look at where it left our ratio, it was exactly where we said we wanted to be. So what I will tell you is, if people are listening to our words, there should be no surprise on that. So that was the driver of the lack of share buybacks in Q3.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. And then lastly, are there any other major joint ventures that you have that could be in a similar situation to Ratliff?
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: No. There are not any other major ones that I would anticipate having a similar conversation around.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Understood. That's great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.: Thanks again for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings call. We are excited about the future of Martin Marietta, and we're in a very advantageous position through our superior geographic locations in markets that continue to experience strong employment growth. The favorable construction outlook, with significant pricing opportunities still to come, will benefit this company for many years. Martin Marietta's focused execution of its strategic plan should provide a firm foundation to enhance long-term shareholder value. We very much look forward to discussing our full-year results with you in February. Thank you for your time and support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Q2 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. You may begin sir.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong topline and bottom line growth in the record setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the Company's geographic footprint. Importantly this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets among high growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics. For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase combined with an improvement in our gross margin led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions. Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56% both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit above our stated target of 60%. As will be expanded upon in a moment we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume. Widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7% led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready mixed concrete business delivered up 15% increase in pricing again with strength in both Texas and Colorado led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor running from North to South through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio Texas. Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions declining railroad balanced volumes and lower direct sale energy shipments. Our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter poor whether in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter of 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first two months of the second quarter in many of our key states including Texas and the Carolinas. As shown in the Divisional Precipitation Maps on Slide 5. As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Nino weather pattern which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016 What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for seven years. This may the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8-inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. The Mid-America Group led the Company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and non-residential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group’s shipments increased nearly 2%, large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalysts for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower ballast shipments. The West Group were shipments were affected by heavy rainfall reported a 3% decline including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions. In addition to weather deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in share related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balance sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group. These factors drove the West Group’s negative volume comparison to prior year. Overall aggregate shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6% in line with our full-year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country. The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes combined with improved cost performance together with modestly improving operating conditions drove over 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado based business. We view the results for the six months of the year is confirmation that our expectations are well placed. For the second quarter the cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit representing a 40% gross margin. Note as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8% and expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter. Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all three primary end use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-85 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups. Importantly we continue to see increasing demand across this end use market and remain confident in its steady and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and multiple state initiatives. Among them the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026 especially in the growing Martin Marietta Metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and Houston doubling the prior decades record investment level. The nonresidential end use market comprised of two components light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. For the heavy nonresidential component, is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy related activity. Growth in the nonresidential end use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly a 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the reacceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion the country is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year. The chem-rock/rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales. In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release. We also provided two updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the Company guidance on 2016 cement pricing changed. Current expectations are for full-year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full-year outlook for the cement businesses net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy related activity. We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the Company benefits from its leading positions in high growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric. Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit, and record net earnings. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues expanded 478 basis points to over 29% approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin and 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2015, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares which coupled with our sustained dividend returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98 times in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2 times. As you look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth and construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge momentum index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by one full-year increased over 11% in June to 134.4 is highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits, starts and completions remain strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads, and bridges. Strong employment gains which serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpin the construction forecast. In fact of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth, Texas ranks third, Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas and our markets had employment gains above 3% including Dallas; and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa; and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina. To conclude we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and we're well-positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction, and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first is really more on volumes and backlogs in particular. Could you give more color on backlogs, particularly areas affected by weather in the quarter, and how much do you think of the volume shortfall in the quarter was driven by weather and/or delayed starts of projects? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you. Kathryn. What I would say is volumes were down approximately 2 million tons for the quarter based on what we thought it would be. And really as we rack it up it falls into three different buckets; number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that’s your first bridge number. Your second bridge number Kathryn should be on the railroad balance we saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year, but still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons for the quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question I think it's a good one Kathryn is what are we looking at relative to backlogs and how does that feel and what I would say in particular Texas last year had the wettest May in history. This year it had one of the wettest May’s in history. I mention that because if we simply look at a portion of that Texas market. Let's look at what we've got in North Texas. We've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly there is pretty considerable A backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There is some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380 near Denton is one of them State highway 175 outside of Dallas is another and Interstate 45 and 35 both have considerable work. So from a volume perspective what did we see deferred it was the 2 million tons broken down to those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog at this position we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs particularly text type jobs. Kathryn was that responsive?
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. That is very helpful. Do you have any parameters how we can think about it for two other important States Colorado and North Carolina?
Howard Nye: Well here's what I would say with respect to Colorado. Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado with the Rocky Mountain Group, what I would tell is everything within the borders of Colorado is really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain Group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado. Where it's more ballast driven.  o we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure at those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I would tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver whether it’s aggregates, ready mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy market place, particularly on downstream paving we're getting considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we had bid on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year, we see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we’re seeing a very healthy Charlotte, so that's been a market that has continued to perform well importantly as we go East out of Charlotte and get to the triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in the end marketplace. As we come farther East yet and hit Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy, multifamily residential has been very, very healthy, residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. The part of this state is still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I did want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. That’s very helpful. And one follow-up related to rails. One, I just wanted to make sure that I'm correct in thinking that rail operators can kick the can down the road only so far in terms of deferring maintenance CapEx. And then second along with that was just really a separate subject, but how do you think Martin's cost structure maybe impacted in the future by various changes that the rail operators are currently undergoing.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, I guess I’ll respond to your first comment and really just agree to it. Maintenance is something that in the early and since with the downturn is always going to see this pull back. And I think that's exactly what the railroads are doing and I think it's fairly predictable once they saw their volumes declining. That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they do need to maintain. So that's not a matter of – yes, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that we’re the largest shipper of stone on four out of the five class 1 railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network. Our ability I believe to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starved parts of the country particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and the Atlantic coast well oddly enough most likely be helped by this circumstance.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Howard, I’m wondering if you could talk about just the chem-rock/rail guidance for the year, so year-to-date that part of your business was down 19%. And I think your full-year guidance implies a significant pick up in the back half of the year. But as we step through the qualitative comments on the call, I just want to make sure that still reflects your current views on that end market.
Howard Nye: I think it does right now Jerry, keep in mind that the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the ballast numbers that we had been supplied by the class 1 railroads. So again, the dialog is active with them. They’ve been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the degree that car volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volume and see UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern is down almost 6%. See if we clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn’s point and her question, it can only be held back so long and keep in mind a lot of these places to have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads that have been underwater and have seen that type of duress they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we deal with this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in two different tranche Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovering the Carolinas in the Southeast and some of that by the way could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest in the Rocky Mountains and I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you got those three, but I do think that if you're looking at what the headwinds are. I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind and if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, they're probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Here clearly we do need good, normal weather for the balance of the year and we do need text that to have more of their work go on in a more timely basis. The other issue and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simply within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there are some headwinds. I do think there are some tailwinds, and I give you that in the context that I do believe ballast is the potential headwind.
Anne Lloyd: And Jerry just a reminder that chem-rock/rail segment only about I guess 3 percentage points of that is ballast and it also has agricultural mine and other chemical grade stone, so there are other factors that could potentially mitigate that volume guidance.
Jerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the color. And then can you talk about across your footprint, what are you hearing regarding the pace of public construction work ramping up versus your expectations, so I guess it sounded like last quarter projects got moving a little bit faster than we expected. Is that – was that effectively if you look at it now some pull forward demand and things are evening out now or what's your take on the pace of public activity that we saw in the quarter outside of the weather issues that you outlined?
Howard Nye: I think you are seeing a pickup, but we’ve always said it was going to be more of a 2017 event than it was going to be a 2016 event. I think our verb age in the past is because of how long we had gone without a highway build. It was more likely than usual that we might see some of that activity in the second half of 2016. So it's fascinating to look at it where it was happy. I mean Street starts were down 16%, but again our view was we're going to see unexpected recovery and have to and really more going into 2017. What's fascinating to me Jerry is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period, but over 2014 to 2016 timeframe relative to this subject. And this is what I find, North Carolina, the change on a percentage 2014 to 2016, 58%. Nebraska, same timeframe, up 41%. Iowa, up 18%. Arkansas, up 11%. South Carolina, up 53%. Florida, up 18% with that same timeframe because you did see a pullback is Texas down? It is, but again it's just seemed that normal give and take in that. So again I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation. This is surprising to us. I think we see good momentum going into the back half of the year and I think we see very good momentum going into 2017.
Jerry Revich: And based on the common or good momentum heading into the back year, it sounds like weather and shipments normalized in July and I think is the implication of that comment, is that fair?
Howard Nye: Jerry, I don’t want to talk specifically about July until we are talking in November. Obviously, you can see what we've done with our guidance and the resilience that we have around that.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois: Thank you. First question is just on incremental margins, you've got paced your long-term targets in the second quarter. It seems like to hit the midpoint of your guidance, you need somewhere around 60% so inline with the long-term, but can you talk about some of the levers that you saw in the second quarter in particular on lower volumes you got 70% consolidated incremental margins, which is pretty strong. And what are you seeing as far as the levers of Boston incrementals in the back half of the year and could we perhaps see some conservatism in the incremental margin guidance in the near-to-medium term?
Howard Nye: Garik I guess a couple of things number one I think we need to really give a tip of that have to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment in which they're operating is really challenging because it's stop start and these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I am tell you so look at the cost structure momentum on the labor side has been very good. Momentum on energy has been very good. Momentum on maintenance and repair his gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year in particular as we have accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock particularly the Midwestern United States. And in some of my earlier comments I spoke to the fact that that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow flies there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace as we saw maintenance repair it considerably better. So again our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing again our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of that I think worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line. And that has really been very powerful and if you think about what’s you're seeing relative to the price increases. You've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard to say for a matter of years. It would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point Garik on what it looks like going forward, part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past. Is that we believed in time Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with the lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down costs in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line and importantly it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind we thought we would see these that are incrementals early on in the cycle. So far no surprises.
Garik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. I just want to switch cement for a second of cement pricing you did lower your guidance. Again I think wanted to get some clarity on a comment in the release pricing was down slightly ahead of price increases just want to get more and with that meant and also may be get your take on how the July 1 increases have taken hold in the Texas market?
Howard Nye: No I guess a couple of things Garik. There were July increases in the Texas market we anticipate more coming in October as well that's what drives the two to four pricing that we're showing up. Clearly from when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2 was going to be a shake out period for pricing in Texas. Obviously you’ve got imports that have come in at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we see over the last several years. At the same time part of what we're doing particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So what we're looking at for that shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready mixed operations and you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That to my - in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it clearly pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas we're seeing increases in both markets and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you we're seeing bidding in North Texas today that number is much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers and that's more in line with what we would have expected.
Garik Shmois: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities.
Craig Bibb: Thanks for taking my question. Dallas ready mix market looked particularly strong I'm assuming what’s the strength was Dallas or was that evenly spilt with Colorado?
Howard Nye: The ready mix market generally looks pretty strong but I would tell you is the Colorado ready mix market is particularly strong. I mean is Dallas doing better? It is Dallas is doing considerably better. So we need to start with that, but if we're looking at it just what's going on relative to ASP. ASP in the Texas market have clearly outperformed we're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas it's much better, but I'll tell you as we look across five different districts of ready mix in that marketplace there’s only one that has ASP’s less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them to a much more acceptable type of level. So yes it's getting better in Texas, fall weather was really wet and was not necessarily ready mix’s friend, weather was still better than it was last year during the same time, Craig. So those are your drivers. 
Craig Bibb: Okay. Is there any thing that’s likely to slowdown the Dallas or Colorado ready mix market?
Howard Nye: You know what I’ll say we’ll just work our way North to South again everything that we see in Colorado right now looks incredibly healthy, public looks healthy, private looks healthy, both res and non-res. So we feel good about that entire I-25 corridor. As we're looking in our ready mix business in Texas keep in mind it's principally going to be more North Texas driven than anything else. As we look just broadly across our business footprint from an aggregate perspective and keep in mind we want to feed ourselves, our own aggregates and our ready mix business. About 45% of our aggregate volume in Texas is North Texas driven about 30% is Central Texas driven, 15% Houston driven, 9% South Texas driven. We don't have any ready mix in Houston which is probably the single most challenged market in Texas. That's my way of coming back to your very good question.  Now we feel pretty good about where we are in the ready mix business in Texas. Despite the notion of where you are matters and where you want to be vertically integrated matters even in a vertically integrated market you want to be careful. And I believe that's what we've done in Texas.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And then in Houston switching gears a little bit your competitor was talking about a lull and large project activity along the coast are you guys seeing those?
Howard Nye: We are actually seeing regional activity along the Gulf Coast and the large energy projects that I know. My recollection is they spoke about 30% down in Houston yesterday we're not seeing a number like that, we're seeing a number closer to half of that. But again if you look at the way that our business is built in Texas, we're primarily a North Texas driven Company not a South Texas driven company. So the percentage is will be hard to be apples-to-apples.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And the slowdown with the Texas DOT even with a benefit of proposition one and I guess seven that’s just a timing issue or how did that happen given the incremental funds they have?
Howard Nye: Yes, I think the biggest issue that you've got in Texas is not a lack of work or a lack of potential volumes. So I think the biggest issue that you’ve got in Texas candidly is you’ve got Texas DOT feeling a little bit of growing pains right now because they have let so much work, record work on top of record work that on occasion now they're running into you know we've got a right of way issue here we need to deal with. Or we have the utility issue here that we need to deal with. So I don't think there is any funding issue at all in Texas right now and I think particularly in North Texas what really needs to happen is there more you hate to say it's administrative but it's almost a first cousin to administrative issues that TXDOT needs to work its way through. I don't have any doubt that they will. I don't think anyone in Texas has any doubt that they will. As I said it's not a matter of, yes its a matter of when.
Craig Bibb: Okay, great. Well thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Craig.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Timna Tanners: Yes, hey good afternoon guys.
Howard Nye: Hello, Timna.
Timna Tanners: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the M&A market. I know that you always highlight your share repurchase program. But just want to get any thoughts about the uses of cash particularly M&A.
Howard Nye: Well, Timna. As you know that’s really number one on the hit parade as far as the uses of cash going forward and the point I’ll say is that we have been engaged in a lot of dialogue and we're talking to a lot of closely held family businesses in particular. And one of the recurring themes that I hear is that if family owned businesses are looking to potentially make moves with your businesses, selling into what they feel like there's an up cycle. It's a pretty sensible thing for them to do. Now you should equally expect us to be thoughtful around value and not put ourselves for the position that we're overpaying. But at the same time in a marketplace I think where people can look at our space and say this looks like it's going to be pretty good for three or four or maybe five years. If you're a family owned business and you've been through a particularly difficult time over the last ten years. They are probably doing some real soul searching right now and we want to be there to help them.
Timna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. In the last conference call I had written down that you are seeing some cement shortages in Texas this year and I know you noted that there is a little more import, but can you give us a little bit more color about what changed and how you see the market going forward?
Howard Nye: Actually what I think I said Timna was if we had demand that we thought we're going to have in Texas, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw cement shortages toward the end of the year, so clearly I was saying that before we had 8-inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view was is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all of those come forward. Even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So for Texas, it's not hedge genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will and from places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States. Those were the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance.
Timna Tanners: Okay. I understand. Thank you. And then, it’s only other thing I want to ask about is just in light of your comments on the energy sector troughing, how should we think about that type of recovery that your customers are signaling to you or how to think about what that could look like going forward coming out of a trough?
Howard Nye: Energy looks like coming out of a trough?
Timna Tanners: Your tonnage in energy end markets, yes.
Howard Nye: Here is the way to think of it. If we are looking for the quarter just for the quarter on what we sold directly to shale energy. We sold about 292,000 tons to the shale sector in the quarter. To give you a compare, last year in the second quarter a little bit over 1 million tons and that wasn't going a great guns last year. This sector doesn't stay down. This sector is going to have to have a return. Do I think this sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014 which by the way was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in 2015 or maybe in 2016. If we look at full-year 2016, that was 3.6 million tons, so basically half of what it had been in 2014. I'm not sure that that is somewhere between that 2.5 and 3.5 wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns. And again I think we're particularly well placed to serve that what it does.
Timna Tanners: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hello, Trey.
Trey Grooms: Howard, first question would be on the tonnage impacted by weather, I think you called out like 1 or maybe 1.5 million tons, just let me get a sense for when this can come through. I know there's a lot of moving pieces there, but if it were going to hit in 2Q and were delayed would that come through in the back half of the year or would that be something that would be more likely to add it to 2017?
Howard Nye: Trey, I think that's a great question. I think a lot of that's going to be weather driven because if we end up with heavy hurricane season in the Carolinas, or Florida, or Georgia is going to be tough. If we end up with an early winter in Iowa and Colorado, it could be tough. On the other hand, if we have a dry Q3 and late winter, frankly you could make up a lot of that. I think one of the biggest issues and as you recall when I was going through the question that Jerry had. I've talked about both headwinds and tailwinds and I do think that issue, that tailwind issues that I described or the headwind issues on work crews, drivers, technical trades and those types of things, in other words everything that's in the supply chain. And again, we saw some of this last year or two when we had that wet weather coming out of Q2. I think that may end up being an issue that's hard for us to measure right now, but my guess is that something that you're hearing in the marketplace as you do your channel checks too.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Okay, but hopefully the weather will cooperate for you guys. I guess the next one would be on specialty products. I think in the guidance there are some implied acceleration there. Can you talk about what's driving that, is that mostly related to your expectations due to steal price movement or just any color you can give?
Howard Nye: No. We're seeing good MagChem work right now. I mean we've really if we're looking at what's going on in the steel industry. The steel industry for us if you're looking at the two components to drive that business broadly. It's what's going on the still capacity that's what about 72% which is a perfectly fine place for to be if it's above 70 we're going to find. Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing. You've got a 21% cost reduction versus the prior year. So if you've got steel that over 70 you've got nat gas down 21% that helps a lot, but then when you've got good business on the MagChem side and keep in mind I want to say historically by 12%, 13% of our revenue is going overseas and that business. May be a little bit more right now. So the type of business that we're seeing that we think doesn't just have a quarter-to-quarter type of impact to it. But likely has a multiple year impact to it. It's actually very attractive to us right now.
Trey Grooms: Okay and I'm not sure how much you can go into detail on this one, but you guys were purchased about $190 million worth of stock I think year-to-date and your balance sheets still going to be in very good shape and within your parameters well below your parameters by the end of the year if you kind of keep that pace up, but do you expect that the cadence could increase in the back half as we see free cash flow generation likely improving in the back half of the year?
Howard Nye: I guess a lot of a difference on what the market opportunities are relative to transactions that we think are attractive because again we're going to look at a purchase of ordinary evidence saying where they were going to look at a purchase of a business that's out there right now. Of course a number of businesses that may come up often times and that being opportunistic. The other thing that I would encourage you to do and you obviously are by the nature of your question where are we on our net debt EBITDA ratio because we told you we were going to keep it right about the two times. And in the prepared remarks I had we were right at 1.98. So we have that bad habit of trying to do is say we're going to do. So will probably keep it right at that level and then much of its going to be driven by what's the opportunity looks like.
Trey Grooms: Fair enough and last one for me and this is just a quick one on pricing for aggregates? Was there any geographic meaningful kind of mix or maybe even product mix, impact on the pricing in the quarter?
Howard Nye: Nope we took a deep dive on that as you'd expect us to and neither geography note product really moved around this time. So what you see is what you get.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. That’s all I’ve got.
Howard Nye: Thanks Trey. See you soon.
Trey Grooms: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel Nicolaus.
Stanley Elliott: Hi, thank you guys for taking my question.
Howard Nye: Sure, Stanley.
Stanley Elliott: A quick question, the ready mix have been really, really strong. How much longer maybe could you help us frame this out kind of what inning you think we are in the recovery of this business. And how we should think about that on the go forward basis?
Howard Nye: First, I guess what I would say on the ready mix business from an inning perspective it's a more mature ballgame in Colorado that it is - in Texas right now relative to Denver and the marketplace North. So if you think back to it what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down the front range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASP's in the Rocky Mountains for example that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that it's a more mature business, but I would say the Southwest is if we're looking at the type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas. If we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at and the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically integrated jobs that we have been South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again I would say this is a game that is in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks we anticipate seeing from return in another perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said we believe the results that we've seen so far this year in particular the results that that we saw on this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving it there. We've got a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are and they're doing a very fine job right now meaning that.
Stanley Elliott: Great. And go back to the balance sheet from a capital standpoint, obviously strong credit rating, if you want to say around this two times leverage target. My guess and I think a lot of people are out there we should see EBITDA growth pretty significantly over the next couple of years. What are the thoughts on taking advantage of some of the tracks of rates you could get now versus the 2018 notes you have at 6 and 6.6 I believe given the outlook for the business and the momentum that you're seeing it right now.
Anne Lloyd: Stanley if you take a look at that those transactions if we were to execute today either at low rates would be NPV negative. So we obviously are looking at them to determine whether or not we should pull some of that forward and refinance. Our whole capital allocation strategy is to maintain the financial flexibility of the business to invest in acquisitions that come along at the right – the right acquisition in the right markets for the right price to fully fund what we need from an organic and capital perspective. And then maintaining net debt-to-EBITDA two times which as Trey indicated earlier means there will need to be some type of incremental activity that takes place in the second half of the year to do that, should our expectations fall through. And then just keeping up with that financial flexibility to execute against the M&A opportunities when they present themselves on a broader scale.
Howard Nye: And Stanley the other thing that I would add is and Anne alluded to it. Obviously we're putting CapEx into the business right now ahead of DD&A and part of what we've always discussed is DD&A which runs today is about $275 million is not a bad proxy for you to have in the back of your mind on what our stay in business CapEx needs are. And we're anticipating about a $350 million capital spend this year. And if you go back to part of what we discussed earlier about what capital is doing at times for our cost structure and part of what I’ve referenced before is the dialogue we're having particularly on the rolling stock in the Midwest and United States. Making sure we're in a position to invest in the right way at the right time there is really important too. So it all rolls together very seamlessly.
Stanley Elliott: Yes. Absolutely. And just to clarify did I hear you say you're looking to hire some new shifts in Carolinas? Was that what I had heard? 
Howard Nye: I think what you heard was as it’s contemplating the need to do that to better meet customer needs. So in large part what I'm trying to say is it's getting awfully better in the Carolinas.
Stanley Elliott: Sounds like a high class problem. So congratulations and best of luck.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Stan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors.
Robert Norfleet: Good afternoon, guys.
Howard Nye: Hi, Rob.
Robert Norfleet: Just a quick question. Can you kind of discuss Ward how you guys assess returns and as it relates to buying existing capacity that being acquisitions versus Greenfield opportunities in Brownfield growth opportunities such as opening a new quarry or expanding existing production sites from an IRR perspective?
Howard Nye: What we're always going to run a model on it, we're doing transactions we're going to look at a 15% IRR on a post tax basis I mean that's going to be the beginning of the analysis.
Anne Lloyd: Yes, just obtain your DCF on that.
Howard Nye: But Rob at the end of the day it's going to be driven by what our strategic plan says. I mean keep in mind if you remember those debts that we've gone through we look at our markets very clearly, protect, expand, hold, target, exit and depending on what a market is going to dictate how we look at that market how we want to invest in it or otherwise. The other thing that we're mindful of we have the ability to Greenfield. We've clearly done that in places like Wadena we're going to do some of that in Hunter. I think we've done that very well I think we've done more of that probably than others in the space. At the same time if we go back to eight, nine years ago this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really if we’re looking at Greenfielding in markets they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity to the greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a one or two position that right now it’s 85% of our markets or 65%. Let's call it six years ago. If we can take that 85% percent number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that. That's an awfully good and high use for our dollars. So that's how we're going to think about that.
Anne Lloyd: And Rob if we laid out in Investor Day we are always a pretty solid land buyer we had a big buy in land last year and we will always look for those opportunity for acquiring new properties whether they be appended to existing operations or whether the property for a future Greenfield. 
Robert Norfleet: Okay. That makes sense. And again I was asking kind of on the follow-up of Timna’s question on M&A because you know clearly over the last six to 12 months. It looks like we've seen a number of deals going multiples north of nine and in some cases north of 10 times EBITDA. And typically you guys target wanting to pay seven to eight times and some of these assets that have been sold heavy, heavy competitive downstream businesses. So I'm just I'm curious if you really able to find that sweetspot where you've been able to get assets for seven, eight times or seen where we’re seeing similar to exorbitant multiples paid for some transactions?
Howard Nye: You know what it's interesting Rob because I think the multiple paid is really from our perspective going to be driven by where the business is because candidly our view of what you pay on a sand and gravel business versus what you pay on a hard rock business may vary. Our view of what you may pay for granite hard rock business versus the limestone hard rock business may vary. Our view may vary on open-pit versus underground. So would there be times that we could look at in some markets a double-digit EBITDA multiple absolutely there are times we could do that. Would we rather not? I mean obviously we would rather not. But again it's going to be driven more by the marketplace. It's going to be driven by the plant and it’s going to be driven by a long-term and near-term view.
Robert Norfleet: Okay, great. And my last question. Can you just kind of walk us through in the core states that you operate in funding bills that are being voted on or moving through the various approval stages that could provide additional funds for infrastructure funding. And then secondly to that we’ve obviously seen success with the DOT’s TIGER grant program and its contribution to funding projects. Do you think or what's your opinion of that program being renewed since obviously there's not a multi-year authorization. 
Howard Nye: Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple different tranches. I mean if we look at it in new money terms and not all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I will put in a $0.10 gas tax effect at March 1, 2015 that’s going to basically give that state about a 30% increase in construction activity. That matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces of it probably fit obviously more meaningfully in 2017, but we do think the back half of 2016 could see some activity from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy lighting schedule and they have for the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we've discussed around project delays, administrative is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind, the Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that I would did that they put in a gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next three years, so it adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to be about a $75 million total impact in that state and we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year with the legislature was in session. They basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending, but what North Carolina refers to as the Biennium. So that's a two-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their pennies for progress program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work, and equally Mike Pence as Governor of Indiana wanted to see if he keeps his job as Governor of Indiana, because apparently he's running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in states, roads, highways, bridges over a four-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER Grants Program, you know what I don't have. We would just have to see where that goes up. I’ll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program and where it's going to be impactful, can and will be going into the future. Remember, what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is the $49 billion investment, so and in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen two new applications and in calendar 2015 and 2016 including a couple of projects in Colorado worth $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470 the loop and then about a $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express and then we're still waiting for the Monroe Bypass in Charlotte to go and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we would have to see what happens with TIGER Grants, but I think between the FAST Act state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA it's pretty good future.
Robert Norfleet: Great. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it.
Howard Nye: You are welcome. Thank you for the questions. End of Q&A
Operator: And I’m not showing any further question at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Howard Nye for closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As I think you can tell, we believe we're poised to deliver a great 2016. We continue to experience strong employment growth in our key states, good robust construction activity with increased materials demand and significant pricing opportunities. Our teams focused execution of our plan should provide a firm foundation enhancing long-term shareholder value. And we look forward to talking to you about that when we're together again in November until then take care and be safe. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta First Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to your host, Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on slide two, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. As detailed in the release we distributed, Martin Marietta delivered record first quarter results, reflecting strong operational performance as we began to reap the benefits of a more favorable, broad-based construction-centric phase of recovery and some geographic areas and expansion in others. Our impressive first quarter numbers included record net sales, record net earnings, consolidated gross margin expansion of 790 basis points and an increase in earnings per share of nearly nine times the $0.07 reported last quarter. On a consolidated basis, our operations achieved a nearly 70% incremental gross margin, another notable highlight is our nearly 20% gross margin, mirroring the level attained in the first quarter of 2006, a time when the overall economy was near an all-time highs and annual housing starts in the United States were nearly 2 million units. To deliver a similar performance in 2016, with an economy only in the early stages of construction recovery in many of our key markets, is indicative of the strength and benefit of our geographic positioning and strategic planning. Against that backdrop, the aggregates product line delivered robust volume and pricing growth of 13% and 8%, respectively. The Mid-America Group lead with a 28% increase in aggregates product line shipments. This performance was driven by the commencement of several large, principally state-funded highway projects across the Carolinas, together with increased residential and non-residential construction activity. The West Group reported a 5% increase in shipments and an 11% increase in average selling price. Of particular note for the quarter, North Texas aggregates product line shipments and volume and pricing increased 28% and 12%, respectively. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fastest growing area in Texas, and one of the top nationally for both employment growth and residential construction. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation has announced construction plans in excess of $8 billion per annum over the next several years. This program, which together with the funding provided by the North Texas and Harris County Tollway Authority, should lead to further growth in customer backlogs, our attractive leading Texas market positions will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities for the balance of the year and indeed for years to come. In addition to volume growth in the quarter, we benefited from a stronger pricing environment. Simply put, aggregate pricing is up broadly across the company's business. The ready mixed concrete product line enjoyed strong demand and much improved operating conditions in Texas. This two-fold combination drove 31% increase in shipments and a nearly 12% increase in average selling price. The result, a 46% increase in net sales and an 810 basis point improvement in gross margin. Texas-based ready mixed concrete operations are expected to contribute significantly to full-year profitability, following a profoundly weather-impacted 2015 that effectively masked the potential of this TXI-acquired business. The stated aim and expectation is for profit margins in the Texas ready mixed concrete business to rival that of our Colorado-based business. We see these early 2016 results as a good start toward the fulfillment of that goal. As a result of the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, comparability of results for the cement segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California cement operations is detailed on slide five. Our remaining cement business, which is entirely in Texas, benefited from considerably-better weather, but importantly strong demand, which is forecasted by the Portland Cement Association to continue for the next several years. For the quarter, the business generated nearly $70 million of net sales, and $33 million of gross profit. This translated to a 47% gross margin, which increased over 1,000 basis points as compared to the prior-year period. EBITDA for the cement business was $37.8 million, a 37.5% increase from the prior-year quarter. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered record first quarter net sales of $59.5 million. The Magnesia Specialties team continues to diligently manage the cost profile of the business, and despite U.S. steel capacity utilization being nearly 2.5% lower than the prior-year quarter, our business delivered gross margin expansion of 430 basis points to a first quarter record, 38.6% gross profit margin. Looking at our entire business, given the strong first quarter performance and increasingly positive outlooks for the Southeast, most of Texas, and our downstream businesses, we have raised our full-year EBITDA guidance. We now anticipate a range of $1 billion to $1.05 billion of EBITDA, with increased profitability and margin expansion expected across nearly every business line. The broad-based acceleration in construction recovery is visible in all three primary-induced markets. Again, first-quarter growth was driven by large projects in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups with a 25% and 11% increase, respectively, in infrastructure shipments. Notably, important cities in the Carolinas are enjoying the benefits of this trend. Places like Charlotte are benefiting from the new I-77 HOT lanes P3 project and ongoing work at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Also, Charleston, South Carolina, has significant port growth as well as strong attendant infrastructure development. Similarly, in the Southeast, the long anticipated I-4 activity in Florida contributed to the positive quarter-over-quarter change. Overall, aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market accounted for approximately 39% of our shipments and increased 13% over the prior-year quarter. We're encouraged by solid growth across this end use market, resulting from state-level funding initiatives passed just last year. With the acceleration of projects in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, combined with another year of robust Texas Department of Transportation program lettings, we expect continued meaningful demand growth. The non-residential end-use market comprised of two components, light construction and heavy construction, accounted for 33% of quarterly aggregate shipments and increased 14% as compared with the prior-year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with the drivers, light non-residential aggregates volumes increased 20%, led by nearly 26% growth in the Mid-America Group. Following several years of modest recovery in this area of our business, strong employment growth and residential activity in North Carolina is driving increased non-residential construction investment. The heavy non-residential construction component is primarily industrial building, as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 24% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and increased 12% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a 20% increase compared with the prior-year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States, as housing permits, starts and completions are each up more than 10% for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016. Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the reacceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the year. The chem-rock/rail market accounted for the remaining 10% of aggregates product line volumes and increased slightly. Consolidated gross profit margin was nearly 20% and expanded by the previously mentioned 790 basis points over the prior-year first quarter, reflecting margin expansion in all reportable segments. Robust demand and much improved weather conditions drove significant growth for the ready-mixed concrete and cement businesses, which increased gross profit margins by 810 basis points and over 1,000 basis points, respectively. To summarize the growth in our consolidated results, first-quarter 2016 delivered record net sales of $734 million, an increase of $102 million, or 16%; gross profit of $145 million, an increase of $70 million, or 95%; record earnings from operations of $84 million, an increase of 228%; and EBITDA of $153 million, an increase of 67%. Net earnings growth drove a 91% increase in operating cash flow in the first quarter, to $67 million compared with $35 million in the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares of our common stock, in line with our stated capital allocation strategy, and together with our dividend, we returned $176 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the first quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.3 million shares, returning nearly $670 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.7 million shares remain under the current authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016 was 2.1 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2 times. As we also noted in today's earnings release, we have upwardly revised our 2016 guidance for aggregates volume and EBITDA. Our improved outlook reflects additional strength in underlying demand and increased margin expansion from our original projections. We're confident that continued positive employment growth in our key markets, strong contractor backlogs, and normal weather patterns will drive more than $1 billion of EBITDA in 2016, a new milestone for Martin Marietta. You will also note that we increased our expectations for public sector growth from mid-single digits to mid-to-high single digit volume growth in 2016. The growth reflects continued state and/or municipal-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, and Florida. To conclude, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance and improved expectations for the balance of the year. We're positioned to deliver record results as we continue to recognize the considerable benefits of our unwavering focus on our leading positions and economically-diverse, high-growth markets. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars, and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value. If the operator will now give the necessary instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first is going to focus on margin, excuse me, the guidance that you gave for quarter, first on end-market growth projections and then shifting to margins. But in light of Q1 results and infrastructure non-res growth rates that you outlined in your guidance, and granted you did bump up your infrastructure end-market guidance, but the projections seem to be – could potentially be conservative in our view. What is your best estimate as to the pull-forward in demand from Q1 from just easy comps and extremely warm weather throughout the U.S.? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Kathryn, thanks for your question. I think, as we look at Q1 and we look at the rest of the year, and I think the primary things that I would say to you, it's Q1. So really we're not going to look at Q1 and let that necessarily dictate the way the entire rest of the year looks. To answer your question very directly relative to what we saw as pull forward, as you recall when we ended the year last year, we thought we had probably 3.5 million to 4 million tons of aggregates that we felt like had some form of deferral because of the remarkably wet weather that we experienced in 2015. Our best estimate is we saw about a 1 million ton pull-forward in Q1. Our guess as we are looking forward is that's probably not a bad number for you to think about relative to Q2 and Q3 with the number then getting marginally smaller as we go into Q4. So again, from a timing perspective, based on what we see on infrastructure, we just feel like it's the first quarter, again trying to address the other piece of your question, what did we see pull forward, trying to address very specifically what we saw in the quarter and what we anticipate in the quarters going forward.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. And sticking to the theme of infrastructure, and in particular, visibility, this is something you know that we've been focusing on for quite some time in certain states, some of which you noted on the call including Georgia, North Carolina, past changes in how states fund – approach funding infrastructure projects. Are you yet seeing the impact of those dollars flowing through? Or realistically is this something that you'll start see flowing through later this year or even into next year?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the answer is, yes, Kathryn. I think it depends on the states. I mean, here's the way for you to think about it. North Carolina has put forward a budget that could add up to $1.1 billion through the biennium. And what we saw after North Carolina did that last fall was the acceleration of about 90 projects in North Carolina, some of those were going out as far as 2025 and even beyond. So, we are seeing that type of pull forward, not just here in our home state. We're seeing that to a degree in Georgia as well. Governor Deal came forward with his series of projects that he would like to see accelerated. So I think we will see some of that this year. If you recall, last year, we had seen the gas price – the gas tax go up in Iowa that was going to add about 30% of what that state DOT could do. We've also seen some near-term initiatives in Nebraska that'll clearly be more profoundly felt next year. We've also seen good activity, not just at the state level in Colorado, but we've also seen it at the municipal level in Colorado. Colorado Springs has put some very specific plans in place that would help drive volumes we feel like in Southern Colorado to a degree even this year. So, Kathryn, what I would say our state and local initiatives helping in some places now? Yes. Will that continue, I think, to be even more profound as we go into next year? I think the answer to that is yes as well. Remember, to the extent that we get benefit from the FAST Act that's going to principally be a 2017-and-after event. We will likely feel some of that in some discrete markets this year. But we will likely feel more state impact in those markets and then probably the one-two impact of that beginning more in earnest in 2017.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: And I'd assume that's the same for Texas Prop 7 which dollars hit in September this year so it will more be a 2017 impact...
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: If you recall, that's actually next year, Kathryn. So you're going to have a Prop 1 effect that will go through this year. Prop 7 is actually coming in really beginning September 1 of 2017. So that's how you're going to see that transition there.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Great. And final question is on margin guidance. Was a little ahead of our expectations, which is all a good thing. Maybe if you or Anne could go through the levers that drive the upside to your margin guidance. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know, Kathryn, it's just a couple things. One, volume always helps and more volume in the East always helps, too. So if we come and take a look at really what had happened if we're just looking at margin guidance in the Eastern United States in particular, if we're seeing volumes obviously moving in a better direction, in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, that's an awfully nice help. The fact is, if you look at incrementals for the business, we were right on target or ahead of target if you look at the numbers that we put forward. But interestingly, if you take a look at Mid-America, that group had margin improvement to 46% versus 37% in the first quarter of last year, but here's the trick to it, Kathryn. The Mid-Atlantic division was almost 70%, Mideast was 42% and the Midwest, really this time of year doesn't make any money because they're caught up in winter. So again, as we're looking at the type of improvement that we think we can see, where that's going to come from is going to matter. The other piece of it that matters is we were able to operate remarkably more efficiently in Texas, simply because it was dry. So if you pull together two different things, one, more normalized or friendly weather, which helps, and then a certain degree of geographic mix that helps as well. The simple fact is, Kathryn, we could do something this quarter we haven't been able to do in a while. We had a dry track to run on and we just put the rings down and let the horse go and when you do that, those are the types of results that we think we can see.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Kathryn, it's Anne. I think the supplement that you'd – we saw good profitability coming out of the ready mixed concrete business, and so that business line margin expanded as well as out of the cement business. So it really was across the board and I would say Magnesia Specialties delivered a strong quarter and probably slightly ahead of our expectations for the year. Principally, energy, our steel demand at about 70% utilization, which is a critical factor, favorable natural gas costs, and then incredible cost control by that group of managers.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Timna.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello. I wanted to get a little bit more color on the timing of the diesel tailwinds that have been helping and assuming more flattish prices going forward, is that a factor? And maybe margins tailing off a little bit, if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in diesel?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I guess a couple of things, if we look at diesel, Timna, we used just about 10 million gallons of diesel for the quarter. And if we're looking at the prices, about $1.84 a gallon and keep in mind that does include the cost of the fixed price hedge if we have in that. So really if we look at it and think of it in our numbers, the hedge actually gave us about $4.5 million headwind as we are going through the quarter. As a reminder, the hedge wraps up at the end of this year. But if we also look ahead, I can give you a good sense of what gallons looked like last year. We did 9.9 million gallons Q1 this year versus 9.2 million gallons Q1 last year, and Q2 last year, we did a little bit more than 11 million gallons; in Q3, it was almost 12 million gallons; in Q4, it was a little bit over 10.1 million gallons for a total of almost 42.5 million gallons. So that'll give you a sense of it. The other thing that I would say is if we're looking back to Q1 last year, diesel was at $2.04 versus $1.84 this year, and if somebody had told us last year in Q1 that we would still have energy as a tailwind and a friend overall, I'm not sure I would've believed it, but here we are.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. On the specialty – on the Magnesia segment, I was a little confused by the comments because steel demand is pretty low as you've mentioned and then you had pretty solid results. So just wondering is that a structural changes, have you done some cost-cutting? Or does this mean that you can have higher profitability at a lower steel utilization going forward?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: If you think about it, Timna, the primary thing that we said are two things really drive that business, if you've got steel utilization at 70% or better, and if you've got natural gas prices that are well behaved, those two things will help that business pretty considerably. If we're looking at what the cost of nat gas was, that was down about 32% for the quarter. So nat gas was giving that a tailwind, but even while steel was down 2.5% versus where it was last quarter, it was still at that 70% number that Anne referenced in the last conversation that we were just having with Kathryn. And candidly 70% isn't an overheated number. I mean we've built that business with that very capable team recognizing that 70% was probably a pretty safe number to have out there. And look, are we awfully proud of seeing margins at 38% when you've got steel at 70%? I think those are tremendous numbers and I think that team really should take a bow. So were we pleased with those results? I would say, very pleased. Have we changed anything structurally? The answer is no, we really built it to make sure that those levels would operate very well with where we wanted to take the business.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, just to supplement that, Timna, dolomitic lime really is the principal product that goes into the steel industry. The mag/chem business is actually seeing some good solid demand across really all the geographies that we serve, which is, as a reminder that is an international business.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. If I could get one last in. I just wanted to know if you could characterize what you're seeing in M&A, because there's been some small deals and obviously your cash position is great. So just wanted to – or your balance sheet position in general – wanted to just get a sense of how are you are seeing the M&A environment for now. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Timna. We have a very busy team in strategy in development, so they are looking at a number of different transactions today. I think what you saw us announce at the end of last year and what you've seen us announce early this year, are the types of bolt-on transactions that you should expect us to continue to look at. Specifically, I'm talking about what we did in Southern Colorado simply as an example. Those are markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near term and long term. So you should expect us to be active, looking for though importantly the right deals, because I think we're in a coveted space. I think we're in a spot that we can participate in deals. We can add synergy to those deals, but we're also in a space that we can buy back our shares as well. And there are not a lot of companies who can do that one-two punch that we can offer right now. So that's our take on M&A as it pertains to third parties and M&A as it pertains to ourselves.
Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Sure. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the gross profit guidance within the aggregates product line. If I could, you raised your volume guidance by about 1.5 million tons, kept the pricing guidance the same, but the profit guidance was raised by about $55 million. So if you take the volume increase and apply the full drop-through, it would be about $20 million. So I was just wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit of color. You talked about efficiencies. You talked about geographic mix. But how should we think about the maybe the $35 million bridge from the growth in revenues versus the growth in profits that you are expecting?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Garik, I think you've hit the two drivers, very candidly. I think we anticipate if we have normal weather, the efficiencies will be much better, and that's a powerful lever. I don't want to undersell that lever. I think candidly the more powerful lever right now is what's going on in Georgia, what's going on in Florida, what's going on in South Carolina and what's going on in North Carolina. And keep in mind what you haven't really seen in any significant material way yet is what we feel like is going to be a pretty busy year in Indianapolis, in our Mideast business, and it's likely to be a very busy year in our Midwest business as well. Garik, as I sit here and really just think about our aggregates business and take a measure of it, what I would say to you is, it wouldn't surprise me at the end of the year to have a record year in the Rocky Mountain division. It wouldn't surprise me to have a record year in our Midwest division. I think we're going to have a record year in our Southwest division. We're going to have a remarkably better year in our Southeast division and we're going to have a remarkably better year in our Mid-Atlantic division, and candidly it's possible to have a record year in our Mideast division. So if you're thinking about those different divisions, which ones of those are pure aggregates and the sheer number of those that are now transitioning to the eastern half of the United States, I think that type of activity both from an infrastructure perspective and frankly other perspectives combined with higher efficiencies really drives that delta that you're seeing in profitability.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Garik, just to add a little color to that, our first quarter margins of 20% and then drilling down into the aggregates business even more, we actually had some acceleration of stripping cost and repair and maintenance cost in the first quarter, as our teams in the field are prepping for what they think, for the backlog that's out there for the balance of the year. So, part of that margin expansion and efficiency too comes from a lot of those costs that have been incurred, and like Ward said, ready to let the horse run.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. That sounds good. Thanks for the detail. Just wanted to follow up on cement. It seems like you won back market share in the first quarter. I'm just wondering how you feel your market share is positioned right now as you look at the Texas cement market through the remainder of the year. And then also you did reduce your cement pricing guidance, so I just wanted to see how you are anticipating the April price increases to go and what that means with respect to the market share question that I asked previously.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. I guess a couple of things, Garik. If we go back to the conversation that we had in February, and I think in large part the first quarter, I think the term we used was shaking out. It's probably shaking out about the way that we thought that it would. I think we said we thought it would be an easier or better pricing environment in North Texas than it was going to be in South Texas, I think that's been entirely true. The Comptroller is very helpful in putting out the different numbers that the marketplace can see. That 21% market share or in that ZIP code is not a place that we think is a bad place for our business to be. I've also referenced the fact that we, I believe, can be a remarkably efficient producer of cement in that marketplace as well. I think one reason that you saw a modest pull-back perhaps in the pricing is, we've seen relatively good activity on volumes, as you saw. And what we've also done is we've had some wholesale sales, particularly in that North Texas market to other producers that are in that marketplace, and the wholesale prices clearly go at a different number. So, if I'm looking at probably about 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter that were wholesale tons, and then take a look at really what were some product mix issues, simply really selling more customers pick-me-up product, FOB the plant, and I would say that was more driven in South Texas than it was driven in North Texas. And then back to, as we discussed in February, there are some competitive dynamics there that we're sensitive to. I think when you tally those together, it brings you to the point that you see in the full results. What I believe is, if we have the weather in Texas that I think we're going to have, I think we're likely to have a very active year in Texas. I like the way I'm seeing our ready mixed business run. Frankly, I like the way I'm seeing other ready mixed businesses run in Texas right now. I think the fact is, it's pretty conceivable that you could have cement shortages in Texas as we get to the main part of the year. And I'll let you draw your own conclusions on what that may mean relative to cement pricing going forward. Again, as we're looking at this business from an efficiency perspective, on pricing, and really running it for profitability, I'm very comfortable with where that is. The other thing that's interesting to me, Garik, is to see what's going on with cement pricing in other parts of the United States as well. So, if I'm looking in places like Colorado or the Carolinas or otherwise, I'm seeing cement prices in those markets that are at times $25 or more a ton of where we sit in Texas right now, which gives me a sense we've got some nice runway ahead of us on this. But keep in mind, as we take a look at where we sit on pricing in cement in Texas today, we're 20% up in South Texas from where the prices were when we combined with TXI, and we're 30% up in North Texas, from where prices were. So, I've tried to give you some context. I apologize for the length of my response. But I think the context is important.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: I appreciate the color and congratulations and we'll see you next week in Dallas.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Garik. Look forward to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good afternoon, Ward and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jerry.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect the pricing cadence to play out over the course of this year. Last year you opted for a major price increase on January 1, and I'm wondering if you see potential for sequential price increases this year as we go through the year.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: And then we're talking aggregates, Jerry?
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In aggregates, yeah.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So, we're seeing nice price movement in really important markets. The only markets where we're not seeing remarkable price movement, it's fascinating to me we got some freight adjustments that we had to deal with in some and we simply have some mix issues in others. So, I'm looking quarry-by-quarry, product-by-product. I'm seeing good price increases in all of those. What I would say, too, Jerry, is we're in a marketplace where volumes continue to go up. So pricing, as you know having watched us go through the cycle behaved exceptionally well even in a down market. From where I'm sitting right now, Jerry, I think trying to measure it going forward, if FW Dodge is a good indicator. Dodge right now is looking at three good years ahead of us right now. We probably would've said the same thing last year and that was before we ended up with a five-year highway bill. So, as we're sitting here, Jerry, I think the rhythm and cadence, the price increases this year won't be dramatically different than they were last year, for example. I think they've been very strong so far. I think you're going to have a geographic mix that's going to give a tailwind to the way pricing is looking. But I also think that what we said for the last couple of years is entirely true and that is the Western United States on a percentage basis has more price power ahead of it than does the East, simply because the East is the more mature market, prices are higher, so your percentages up won't be as great. But, again, as North Carolina continues to recover, as Georgia continues to recover, as Florida continues to recover, and as places like Dallas-Fort Worth, as I referenced in my opening comments, have the type of volume growth and pricing growth that they are experiencing. The pricing story we think will continue to be a very good one, not just for a matter of quarters, probably for a matter of years.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Ward, you've commented in the past that based on the reserve position in Colorado and Dallas markets, where you participate, you would look for aggregates pricing to approach company average pricing over time. Can you just give us an update on where that stands today and how much do you think that gap could narrow in 2017?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, absolutely. If you recall, when we were looking at the transactions in Texas, particularly in North Texas, I want to say at the day and the hour, those prices were about 60% of the corporate average. As we look at it today, it's about 75% of the corporate average and what we'd spoken of at the time, Jerry, is we thought it would probably take about three years for that to build to something that felt more like a corporate average. I think that's still not a bad place for us to be as we look at it. The other thing that I would tell you is really it was starting last year that we saw aggregate pricing in Colorado start to move on percentages that were really better than what we're seeing across the corporate average. Now, do I think Colorado is going to be there from a time perspective, at the same time as Texas is? No, I don't. It's going to move a little bit more slowly than Texas. But I still think probably over a five-year period, basically over what we look at as our strategic planning period, Colorado should be closing in on it. Texas very much should be there. Is that responsive, Jerry?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You also saw obviously the West Group pricing dynamics, and that's where the Dallas market and the Colorado market would be reported. And I think you can continue to expect those areas – that area of that country or that segment to report pricing at a higher rate than the balance of the country or the corporate average.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's super helpful. And, lastly, I'm wondering if you could talk about what proportion of your sales were out of your long-haul network within aggregates this quarter compared to last year and how do you expect the full year mix to look like the long-haul versus trucks or markets for you?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know, what, Jerry, I'd rather not go into specific percentages on that. But I'll tell you, for example, though, is the yards that we have in Florida right now are really some of the best businesses that we have in the East. So if you think about what's going on in Florida and if you think about what's going on in South Texas, coming out of that new Medina Rock & Rail facility, those businesses to us look better than they did last year. And when we come back and take a look at the full year, my guess is those are probably going to be somewhere in the teens overall from a volume perspective. Keep in mind, what we move by rail in the United States all by itself, ignoring everything else that's shipped by truck or otherwise, is a top 10 aggregates producer in the United States. So it's a considerable piece of the business. But the areas that we have that business, it's performing exactly as we would have thought, maybe, modestly ahead.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome, Jerry. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good afternoon and congrats to a good start on the year.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you so much, James.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: My first question, you've talked about weather a little bit and if the weather holds up. What are you seeing in Texas and in the South, in general, following the storms? Did that have any impact on the first quarter at all? And do you think it will impact the second quarter any on a volume basis?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what the first quarter was relatively benign and I would tell you not that negatively weather impacted. Now in fairness, April is pretty wet. You saw pretty massive flooding in places like Houston. And does that slow work down for a while? Yeah, it does. And at the same time, you're close enough to the Gulf in areas like Houston that you tend to have areas that can dry out relatively well, particularly if they have a windy circumstance. So I'll put it this way, James. May is an important month. It always has been. The two months in the aggregates business that tend to be disproportionately important are May and October. May, because it's the first time across the geographic footprint that you have every bit of your business usually really hitting on almost all cylinders and October because that's the last month that, A, is usually dry and a lot of contractors feel like by the time they get to Thanksgiving, in many respects, they'll be packing up their equipment for the year. So, was April a wet month? Yes, it was. Does May need to be a relatively dry month for the industry? Yes, I would say that it does.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Extremely helpful. Thank you. And then just coming back to ancient history, hopefully at this point, any leftovers from fracing falling off or was that pretty much completely gone at this level and what are you seeing in that market?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. And again, thank you for the question on that. I want to be really clear because really what we sell in the marketplace to the different shale energy players, just to be clear, is not frac material, so we're selling materials to the shale energy players who are building roads or building their pads. So I want to make sure we're clear on that. What we had indicated, we thought, is that we would see relatively maintenance levels of stone going to these different shale plays in the United States. And what we said is for the year we thought that would probably be in the ZIP code of 2 million tons or about 0.5 million tons a quarter. That's what we viewed as maintenance. So actually as we come back and take a look at exactly where we are in Q1, you know what? It's good to be right and we were right on that. So, it will – I guess we'll take that, we'll take being right, I'm sorry it's 500,000 tons, but I'd love to see three times that because that's where we were last year.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, James.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Hey, good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Adam.
Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Kind of following up on that, the heavy non-res you had some nice growth in the quarter and I think that's a change from previously. Was that due to some of the awards you talked about earlier this year?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's not that much of a change for us because a lot of what we're seeing is driven by work that we're seeing, not just in South Texas and that's where a lot of it is, but we are seeing good, nice, non-res and portions of South Carolina. In fact, I called out South Carolina specifically on some infrastructure in our prepared remarks, but we're seeing good non-res in that market. We're also seeing good non-res in Dallas, in Denver, in Orlando, in College Station in Texas as well. So the non-res that we're seeing looks pretty good. I think one data point that's probably worth knowing is six of the Martin Marietta states rank in the top 10 for growth in non-res starts. And two of the states include Florida and Colorado. I think a lot of it, Adam, really comes back to this notion that we discussed I think a lot over the last couple of years, because we were hoping that it would come to fruition the way that it has. Where you are matters. As we're looking at the states in which we have leading positions and keep in mind those leading positions today, one or two, are in 85% versus 65% of our markets five years ago. We've tried to position ourselves in states that have near-term and long-term growth and that tend to have multiple economic drivers in them as well. So again, I don't think the non-res story is dramatically different, but we are seeing some of those very large projects, for example, in South Texas firm up. And we're sticking those backlogs even more capably in our hip pocket right now.
Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: So are you still seeing projects to bid on, on the heavy side or?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. I mean, what I would tell you is our teams both in Martin Marietta as well as our customer base probably feel as optimistic right now as I've seen people feel in about 10 years. And I think a lot of that's driven by the fact that the eastern United States lagged the west, not by a matter of months, but really by a matter of years, in coming back with some degree of non-res projects in particular. And keep in mind, a lot of times we said those projects will follow varying degrees of housing recovery with a 9 to 18 month lag, and if we continue to see permits, starts and completions on housing, all in those double digits, and we also continue to see single-family housing ramp up, that's going to be more aggregate intensive and we're going to see the non-res both light and heavy, I think continue to follow that in a very constructive manner.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think, Adam, one of the things that we've seen pretty consistently across the footprint is a lot of distribution activity. Distribution centers and channels like that, I would say uniformly across the footprint. That's been at accelerated level of activity over the past several months or at least reported activity that's on its way down the pipe.
Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, that makes sense. And just lastly on the, and Ward, I don't know how fair this question is, but can you compare at all the FAST Act to these state-level initiatives? Just trying to get a sense for what's coming in 2017 from the FAST Act versus what we've gotten in 2016 from the state-level initiatives.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: What I would say is this. I don't want to go into 2017 volumes yet as we look at it, but what I would say is you are going to see states continue to let more long-term aggregate-intensive projects over the next several years than they have over the last several years. And I do think the FAST Act will give states who have not been coming out with very specific state initiatives a lot more runway than they've had for a while. I think the real blessing we're going to have, though, if you really pause and reflect on the key states for us, that we'll have both. I mean think of it in these terms. Colorado is going to have both, separate and distinct from what's going on in Colorado Springs. Iowa has both. Nebraska has both. Texas has both. Remember, the extra funding that comes into Texas just from Prop 7 by the time we get to September 2017 is more money than the increase on a per annum basis than you see even in the FAST Act. So the FAST Act is nice because it does put dollars there. But the primary component of the FAST Act that's going to be helpful is time. So what's going to happen, you're going to take extra state dollars and combine that with extra time from the fed. It's going to be the confluence of those two factors that will be more profound, particularly beginning in 2017 and then in the out years.
Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks so much. See you Monday.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you. See you then.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Yes, thank you very much. My two questions, please. You sounded pretty positive on aggregate prices, Ward, but they averaged $13.04 in Q1, but the guidance for the year is only $12.75 to $13.00, so pretty flat. Is there some change going on that you'd expect to offset some of the maybe underlying growth later in the year or am I just being maybe too picky by comparing those numbers? And then secondly, I don't think we talked much about the asphalt business. I mean could you remind me was there a major divestment that impacted that volume number? And secondly, your old firm was commenting yesterday, it's just going to be much more difficult business this year because the escalator clauses were going to kick it, or the adjustment clauses, which would mean that the lower bitumen price would feed through and therefore there would be less pricing power. Does that impact you at all?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, Mike, I would never call you being too picky for asking the questions. That's not a problem. What I would say is this. When you look at Q1, don't ever take Q1 in a vacuum. It's really a good litmus test on exactly what's going on in pricing. Going back to the conversation that we had a few minutes ago, the Midwest is not cranking during Q1. The Mideast is not cranking in Q1. So what you're seeing in Q1 is a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, all of which and the eastern U.S. are pretty high-priced markets. And then you're obviously seeing pricing in Texas, particularly in North Texas, move at very nice percentages. So what I would tell you is you're going to continue to see good robust pricing but what's going to happen is when Mideast, which is principally Indiana and Ohio, in the Midwest which is principally Iowa and Minnesota and Nebraska, come in, those tend to be more corporate average-y on pricing. So again I think we feel very comfortable with the percentages that we put out there. To your question on asphalt, here's the way I would think of it. If we look at asphalt, we did about 2.1 million tons of asphalt last year in the Rocky Mountain division. As you really look at it now, that's the only asphalt that we have left. So we did sell frankly a pretty modest asphalt position that we had around the San Antonio marketplace. So the fact that we don't have that business anymore is not going to be a dramatic driver or not on what we're seeing relative to our business. With respect to liquid asphalt or bitumen and where it is, Mike, my guess is that story is going to change a lot back to what I said before, depending on where you are in the marketplace. Here's the circumstance up and down the front range in Colorado, and when I speak of the front range, I'm really talking about the I-25 corridor. That's where 80% of the people who live in Colorado reside. That market is very, very busy right now on public. It's very, very busy on private res and non-res and in large part you've got a good asphalt market, particularly on the subdivision side, and on the infrastructure side.
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: And a lot of the work in Colorado, particularly a year, a year and a half ago was having to be let a couple sometimes more times, because they weren't having enough bidders who were available. That's going to be a tight market relative to aggregate. It's going to be a tight market relative to contractors who are able to do much of that work. And again, I think it's – we are looking at our asphalt business that is principally a Colorado asphalt business, we feel pretty good about it. Now, relative to your question on how did it do in the first quarter? It didn't really do much in the first quarter and we don't expect it to do much in the first quarter, again because you are there in the Rocky Mountains. If we're looking at what asphalt sales were for us both internally and externally in the first quarter, it was 134,000 tons versus 147,000 tons in the prior year and the 147,000 tons in the prior-year had the Texas business in it as well.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, no, the 147,000 tons excludes the Texas business, so, Mike, from an asphalt tonnage perspective it was about 123,000 tons in the first quarter of 2015 related to that divested business.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Did that help, Mike?
Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.: It does. It helps greatly. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, Ward, and thanks for taking my questions. Your ready-mixed, 31% increase in volume was outstanding relative to the rest of the industry. Could you maybe give us a little more color on what's going on there and what are the stronger end markets?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, Craig, I think the big issue that was going on there is we got rained on all last year. I mean the ready mixed business that really you're looking at when you look at these numbers is what's going on in Texas, and Texas just really never had the ability to show last year what it can do. So again, as you're looking at volume up – volumes up 31%, the pricing's up 12%, you can see what's happened with gross profit, again, I think this is really more of a story that candidly we're not that surprised by. We think we've got a very good position in ready mixed both in Texas and in Colorado. I'm particularly pleased to see what we're doing in Texas though relative to the EBITDA, because part of what we'd said before, we would like to see those margins in Texas approach what we see in margins in Colorado. So if we're looking at EBITDA-ish this year in the Southwest of $38 million, if we are able to do in the southwest on margins what we've been seeing ourselves do in Colorado, that could translate at the right day and the right hour to about $75 million in gross margins, so one, it was a very good story in the first quarter; two, we expect it to be a good story for the rest of the year, but we also expect to see that Texas business continue to do better.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you've got another easy weather compare coming in Texas. But I guess you're going to have more Colorado in the mix. So stay close to that number in terms of volume growth later in the year?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, we'll have to talk about that when we get together on the next call. I did reference early in my comments that April was wet, and I think you're hearing that from all the players in that marketplace. But again, if you think about where the vast majority of our ready mixed is in Texas, it's in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex that you and a host of others will see next week and I think you'll come away with that with a sense that that's a busy market today and it's going to be a busy market for a while.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then last one, relative – in the context of this quarter your cement volume increase was modest relative to everything else but your gross margin increase was incredible. So was there something going on there that drove such a large gross margin increase?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: It was seeing volume going through. It was seeing really the plant capacities working in large part in the 80%-ish. We did have some modest change in the way that some of the kiln maintenance worked, but it wasn't dramatic. So really, I'm not surprised with what we saw in cement. I think everything is working there in large part the way that we thought that it would. I think we certainly anticipated that we would expect margin percentages in that business that rivaled what we see in the aggregates business. And so again, you will see Midlothian here when we're together on Tuesday, and I think again you'll get a great sense of what that's going to look like.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And the spiky shipments of cement within the quarter that was because of the wholesale sales that you were making?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I certainly mentioned the wholesale sales. I just think again the marketplace was healthy. There was some activity that the ready mixed businesses were able to take and run with that they hadn't, and, yes, I did mention the wholesale sales to some other players in the marketplace, but I just think it was the healthier marketplace.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Craig, I do think there was some not from our perspective, but it's my understanding some of the Texas cement reporting had some – perhaps some corrections that needed to be made to it that maybe they weren't – it wasn't counted appropriately.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. I look forward to seeing you guys on Monday.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Craig. We'll see you then.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you again for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings call. We are poised for a great 2016. We continue to experience strong employment growth in our key markets, robust construction activity with increased materials demand and significant pricing opportunities. Many view that current United States construction market is among the world's best. Martin Marietta's superior geographic positions and focused execution of its strategic plan should provide a firm foundation, enhancing long-term shareholder value. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at our 2016 Investor and Analyst Day in Dallas and to discussing our second quarter results with you in August. Until then, take care. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone have a great day.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-10 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Howard Nye - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President Anne Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee Ted Grace - Susquehanna James Armstrong - Vertical Research Garik Shmois - Longbow Research Trey Grooms - Stephens Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brandon Jaffe - Goldman Sachs Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital Mike Betts - Jefferies Craig Bibb - CJS Securities
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Martin Marietta Q4 2015 and full year conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman, CEO and President. You may begin, sir?
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our Web site, supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses we are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except if it's legally required, we undertake no obligation to publically update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our supplemental financial information as well as on our Web site and in our SEC filings. By leveraging a full year of acquired TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability. Expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergy targets in both dollars and timeline, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These impressive results were achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. The tailwinds, 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity as best revealed by a 7% increase in highway construction. Nonetheless we had a very significant headwind as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia, and Colorado disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year masking the underlying strength of general construction. That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with the market acceleration of the construction recovery in key southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded department of transportation programs. We, thus, enter 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds building upon our team's record 2015 results. These past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency. We are also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see a dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta. In December we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina rock and rail quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry as it transitions from a distance rail and truck served quarry to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of this $160 million facility spanned three years, is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's vast network. Medina began operation in January 2016 and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year. As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market positions in economically diverse high growth areas. In November 2015, we purchased Front Range aggregates. And last week, we acquired Rocky Mountain Materials in Southern Colorado, near Colorado Springs. These two bolt-on transactions complement our position in Metro Denver in Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our River for the Rockies asset exchange and provide attractive and leading positions along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population. Following these recent transactions, we have added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregate results. Strategically four years ago we had no front range position whatsoever. Today, we are a marketplace leader with nearly 100 years of high quality construction aggregates and reaching with near and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions. Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered increased net sales and gross profit while expanding gross profit margin. We exceeded our incremental margin target on both a heritage and consolidated basis. Heritage gross profit margin expansion was led by the West Group with a 630 basis point improvement largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015 we have realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year. On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates related and cement businesses, as shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price while heritage ready mix concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready mix concrete and cement so price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10% respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record our near-record recurring precipitation in five of our largest states. The Southeast and the Mid-America Group's lead volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TSI related divestitures which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas but was somewhat offset by declines in direct shale energy aggregates shipments in South Texas. Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% of net sales. Incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full-year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group which achieved incremental gross margin of 135% and 78%, respectively. These are great testaments to our team's focus on controlling costs and delivering outsized results, despite extraordinary uncontrollable weather headwinds. The acquired businesses gross profit margin also expended 300 basis points in 2015 led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. Due to the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, quarterly results for the cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period and in fact comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. However, the remaining cement businesses benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015. Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI cement contracts at below market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin. A 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. The magnesia specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015. Full-year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The magnesia specialties team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year and despite steel capacity utilization declines delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%. Record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%. Record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86% and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%. The significant improvement in net earnings coupled with the absence of TXI related costs drove an increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% when compared to adjusted 2014 which excludes the cash impact of TXI related expenses. We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 million related to the new Medina rock and rail quarry. For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our targeted leverage of two times. In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta and despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook which we highlight on slides 11 through 13. Initially, you will note some improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in third quarter 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth is stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015 surpassing the per-recession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains in addition to contractor backlogs resulting from historic 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond. Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single digit volume increases in our infrastructure business which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. For example, in Texas, nearly $10 billion of department of transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas, Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of four major design build projects aimed at mitigating that areas congestion and improving traffic flow. There is also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston. Additional evidence of state level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina department of transportation or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects. This example is consistent with our articulated expectations around state construction project backlogs. In addition to state level initiatives, we now have the five-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation or FAST Act. Enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act along with state level funding initiatives will drive large multi-year, aggregate intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that have been infrastructure starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. Shipments to non-residential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and light commercial sectors leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high-single digits. The light non-residential construction sectors, primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge Momentum Index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth. Further, four of Martin Marietta states account for five of the top ten and nine of the top 20 in state level employment growth inculding Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado. All positive catalysts for construction activity. The heavy non-residential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the declines in direct shale exploration activity. We believe direct shale activity reached a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect comparability to the first half 2016 results. The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016 reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multi-family rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating further future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina, each ranked in the top ten states for housing starts. Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume and is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. We will now focus on Texas where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger volume markets, principally being the vibrant corridor at Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond led by multi-year infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid non-residential construction. South Texas of course has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by 2.5 million tons in 2015. Again, much of this decline is expected to be offset by the combination of large multi-year energy projects as well as new and ongoing energy corridor road repair work. In late 2016 or early 2017, we will open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta owned property at the Hunter cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our least and nearly depleted new Braunfels quarry only ten miles away to a permitted location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials providing improved access to local market. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond. Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 levels where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect the aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration into Houston economy. That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in north and central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions. The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecasts modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We have previously announced the cement price increase of $12 per ton effective April, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments we will likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California cement business. Profitability is forecasted to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016. On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA, as we have consistently stated our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are investing in aggregates led acquisitions, organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally sound and highly efficient operations and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable meaningful dividend and share repurchases under our existing authority. To conclude, we are optimistic and excited about 2016. We enter the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth and outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundation of pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions we will turn our attention to answering your question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Thompson: The first is just on visibility in general, particularly related to states that have passed new pieces of legislation that should -- we already have seen a significant increase in tax receipts for infrastructure. But the question I have for you, particularly for Georgia and North Carolina given the changes in 2015, have you seen volumes flow through from these legislative initiatives that were passed last year? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, the short answer is, we are going to see it. Think about North Carolina, they have basically put in more money at the end of the year last year, and to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over two year. The other thing that North Carolina has that spending that we will see voted on later on the year. It's a $2 billion building bond proposed as well. So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So, yes, we are seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. And clearly, what's effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it, we will clearly see amped up activity in Georgia. Remember, we were going to be benefitted too by the [indiscernible] planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple of years ago. So now what we will see I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia buttressing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia. Increased activity in North Georgia principally around Atlanta and we know we will see more activity in North Carolina as well. I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year, Nebraska did as well. We are going to see the benefits of Prop 1 money in Texas and we are seeing near record lettings in Florida this year. So we are seeing new money in a number of states and we think as we see more money coming in a number of states including states like Indiana where Governor Pence has basically said he would like to see another $1 billion put to infrastructure in that state. And we have got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa ask. So that gives you a little bit of a feel across the patch Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson: And just to clarify. So if you look at all these initiatives in aggregate, are we in the early innings, middle innings, of seeing the dollars flow through? I would assume the early innings but you're the one in the field seeing the volumes flow through.
Howard Nye: No. Kathryn, we are in the early innings. And I think part of what you are seeing too, it's not just early innings. It's early innings of a different type of work. Think of it in these terms. For much of the last decade we have really been living more on private work than public work. And private work is not as aggregate intensive as public work is. And what we are seeing now is a transition away from repair and maintenance on public work to a very different type of public work that I do believe in the early innings of. And I think you and I both had to sense that the more that we are building new lanes, the more that we are building new highways or new roads and the more of these rural parts of the state are looking to add capacity and open up new lanes and corridors for business, that’s awfully powerful to our business and I think very very much aggregate intensive. So early, yes, more aggregate intensive, yes.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay. And then next two questions. One, I appreciate your giving some clarification on increasing your end market growth projections from Q3 but could you frame the outlook that accounts for the relatively large increase or improvement in the difference? And then the final question would be on cement margins. If you could just help us think about, it does look to be a big jump and maybe help us understand the improvement in cement margins. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about the first part of your question first. I think what we are seeing is increased contracted backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy related industrial contracts, particularly along the Gulf Coast. I think what we were seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn’t raining the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I will give you a sense of that. I have been in Texas three times over the last month and a half and was down there for part of the holidays. And when I am talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally in the week of Christmas when it was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of the year, which I will tell you is unusual but guessing a sense of what's out there. And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had and that’s just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we are looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. And remember what we said about Colorado, the primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado, is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we have been able to effectively do is extend our march down the front range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up. I think as we go back to the second part of your question that is relative to cement. I think several things are going to happen. One, cement was badly affected last year by the rain. I mean it's hard to run a cement business which is a 24x7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim is to be a price leader in that state and our view was, we would rather take those kilns down rather than keep the kiln going and do something that we thought like was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that market place. In large part we believe we are going to have greater efficiencies in cement this year but we also think we are going to see better pricing in cement this year. You saw a little bit of share movement in our business in cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by two distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a kiln, again, that they had idled for a while at Midlothian and they were coming back into the marketplace. And Argos, as we discussed, was bringing in some material into South Texas. We believe as we go into the year, that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we are going to be efficient. We believe we are going to be successful on our pricing increases and we think by the time we put all of that in place, we are looking at very nice improvement in the cement business. And by the way, we are looking for a very nice improvement in the read mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas.
Anne Lloyd: Kathryn, the only thing I would add is that when you are looking at comparability between 2015 and 2016, you have got to remember the impact of the California operations which were really still not at any kind of recovery trajectory.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.
Adam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask first about incremental margins. You guys had very strong margins in 2015 but your guidance for 2016 is in the 55% to 65% range, incremental gross margins for aggregates. Is it possible you're being conservative there?
Howard Nye: No. We have always said that that was going to be on average, so we are really not changing what we said over time. Fairly we exceeded it in this last quarter. I think much of what we said in the past is that’s what you are going to see on average across the enterprise. But we also said it would likely move much more aggressively if you saw growth coming in the eastern part of the United States, particularly in Mid Atlantic and southeast. And if you go back to really put some of those numbers look like they were most impressive. That’s what you are seeing. And to answer your question specifically, I think we are going to see the eastern United States on a percentage basis growing in ways that we haven't seen over the last several years. That’s certainly the indications that we are getting on activity on Georgia, and in Florida, and in South Carolina and in North Carolina. And I think the quick answer is Adam, if we see those areas of the country growing the way that we believe that they will, I will just say this much, the incremental margins will be a nice story again.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask on your end market outlook for 2016. The infrastructure piece and the non-res piece improved from what you said in early November. So I just wondered if you could expand on what got better, maybe it was just stuff that got pushed because of the weather.
Howard Nye: You know what, I think several things. Number one, we didn’t have a highway bill when we were talking about it before. And I think the fact that the highway bill is actually spurring a lot of increased activity. I don’t know how much of that’s going to hit in the early part of '16 but I think you might see some of that actually coming through at the backend of '16, which would be earlier than you would typically see. But I think equally when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives, and again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We are seeing a big Texas number. We are seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we are excited about in Iowa. Again, another record, near-record letting year coming up in Florida. I think all of that helps on the infrastructure side of it particularly. I think if we go to non-res, I mean here is statistic that’s striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecon. But net South Texas shipments actually increased and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we are seeing on the non-res side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I would encourage you to go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications, those types are really very aggregate intensive jobs. Non-building, looking at the trailing 12-months through November was up 19% and a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf. So, again, if we are coming back and seeing what we feel like a really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nice non-res projects, that’s helps. The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter and one of the things that I would like to see is at certain levels it's probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have signed delegations from here to know exactly what they are bidding on. It's not that we don’t trust what they are doing, we just like to see the sheer level of that activity and we saw a lot of that activity before.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.
Todd Vencil: In the release, you guys said that your non-res market was 32% of your shipments in the fourth quarter and was up 3% for the year, and that light non-res was up 27% for the year. Can you split out light and heavy in terms of the volume split in the quarter and talk about which way each one went in the fourth quarter?
Howard Nye: You know, here's the easy way to think about that Todd. The primary thing that I want to think of on the heavy side is what was going on relative to shale. I mean that’s really your show on what was going on on the heavy side. I mean to give you a sense of, to walk through the quarters, in Q1, to shale, we sold about 1.2 million tons. In Q2, to shale, we sold about 1 million. In Q3, to shale, about 830 and in Q4 to shale about 521. Remember in my prepared comments I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels. We view that 500,000 tons a few quarter as a maintenance and that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before, when I said look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter but South Texas shipments actually up. So if you go the one part of the country, they would have felt more acutely the downturn in shale than anybody else. And you brush it away and you say that their volumes were up. That gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd. And then back to that non-building piece of it as well. So the resilience that we are seeing there across our marketplace is pretty comforting to us right now. And we are liking what we are seeing. Does that help?
Todd Vencil: It does. It does. Thanks for that. Not to beat a dead horse, but just to make sure we're clarifying. If you think about the swing factor from the non-res outlook up slightly in the preliminary outlook that you gave back in November to the high single-digit growth that you're talking about today, a big swing factor, it seems like it's not only resilience there on the light side, but also the fact that there were some significant actual contract signings that you saw in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?
Howard Nye: That's very fair. It goes back to that notion that we talked about relative to delegations. We have been signing a lot of them. And the other thing is, number one, it's what we're seeing. And that's what's most important. Equally, it's awfully consistent with what FW Dodge is seeing. So if we look at their latest forecast which came out on January 26, they are seeing non-res up in those same types of percentages that we are talking about. So, again it's nice to see it. It's also nice to go to third parties and said that their data is saying the same thing that our life experience is saying.
Todd Vencil: Good. We like it when those things dovetail.
Howard Nye: It's a beautiful thing.
Todd Vencil: Given the rain in the fourth quarter, and I don't think you said this, how many tons do we think got pushed into 2016 from the fourth quarter?
Howard Nye: Todd, I think, let's just say for the year is probably somewhere around 3.5 million to 4 million tons. I think we have got the vast majority of that obviously being in Texas. I mean there are places in the Midwest, for example, Q4 was wet and we have always discussed the fact that agricultural lime can go if it's really cold but it doesn’t go if it's really wet. So there was a lot of stone sales, principally in North Texas, that got deferred. There was ag lime that was deferred in Iowa. And, frankly, there was some stone deferral not to the same degree that we did in -- that we saw in Texas but we certainly saw some in the Carolinas. We mentioned the fact that we have had a quarry outside Columbia that had several billion gallons of water in it. The other piece of our business, though, that was pretty profoundly affected by the rain was ready mix concrete. And obviously Denver was at some point affected by it, Texas was profoundly affected by it. And the fact is, we're expecting a much better year out of our ready mix business this year. If we get ready mix to the point over time that it's gotten margins like we're seeing in Denver, you're looking at $75 million extra that could come out of ready mix if we have those margins in Texas like we have in Denver. Now we are not looking for that -- up in the year and I think we will and we should. That’s another nice swing factor, Todd.
Todd Vencil: Good. Thanks for that. Final one for me, and I don't want to get you too far out in front, but thinking a little bit longer term on the highway program and some of the comments you've made about it being early days and so on. With the visibility we have now, is it fair to think that we may be able to see a pick up in the growth rate on highway spending in '17 from '16?
Howard Nye: I think there is no question that it's likely that you will see that. Because, again, even in Texas when we are talking about $10 billion worth of lettings. A part of that work is going to be really not occurring in some respects until '17. You are still going to have Prop 1 monies even next year to the tune of probably $600 million or $700 million and then suddenly you are going to have the Prop 7 money coming into that. And then North Carolina was put in that extra $700 million over a couple of years to it. You are going to continue to have the gas tax hitting what's going on in Iowa. And the other thing that’s important is you are seeing a number of TIFIA projects. Let's not forget that while TIFIA is smaller in this newest highway build, TIFIA isn't going away. And we are simply taking a look at what's going on in Colorado relative to, I think it was highway, Interstate 70 and Interstate 470. Those are two significant TIFIA projects that I think are like $1.7 billion to $2 billion. To your point, I think this can be a good slow, steady build. One that the industry can meet but, two, fills I think an overhang of serious needs for long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.
Ted Grace: What I was wondering, could you just -- I want to make sure I understood how to think about the 2016 guidance for cement in Texas. I know you've talked about ceding some share to some degree by design, but are we expecting to recapture all that share in 2016? I want to make sure we appreciate what drives the volume guidance that you've framed out.
Howard Nye: Yes. The fact is, our share has moved around a little bit from call it the high teens to low 20s. And the factors you are talking about, 2% or 3% share in that market place. The fact is, Ted, we really believe that the pricing in that market place is more important than the share that we have given in some respect there. The other thing that I have said to people before, we are very good cement operators in that marketplace and if we need to compete in a way to make sure that we are protecting share, we are certainly willing to do that. But at this point, today, I think we hold about 20.5% market share, that’s a reduction of 2%. To put math to it, it's about $325,000 tons, just to be really granular. And again, I think we have got a good sense of where that breakpoint is between share and price and our sense has been, price has been more important and I think you can tell, given what we have done relative to the business, it has certainly shown that. I mean one important thing to remember there is whether needs stabilize. And as it stabilizes, I think part of what's going to happen is the imports, in particular that were coming into South Texas that Argos is bringing in, will suddenly start to be utilized for their own self supply. And I think the heavy rain in that state last year and their inability to utilize it only for self-supply and going into the marketplace differently, was part of what we were seeing relative to the volumes and to the share loss, if that helps Ted.
Ted Grace: It does. But when we look at 8% to 11% volume growth, we should think about the large majority of that being underlying growth in the market that you participate in Texas?
Howard Nye: That’s correct. And I would say, in particular in North Texas.
Ted Grace: Okay. And then the related question would be, I don’t if it's for Ward or Anne, but when you bridge the gross profit improvement...
Howard Nye: The business, Ted?
Ted Grace: Yes, specific to the cement business.
Howard Nye: Okay. And again, we wish that was going to be up $30 million and the majority of that’s likely going to be driven by the price component of it. But we are going to get efficiencies out of that business if we just had normal precipitation in that state, that would be pretty notable as well. I am not sure I have got a specific percentage breakdown on that. But I would say the pricing is going to be more notable in some respects than with the volume.
Ted Grace: Okay. And then the other thing I just want to ask quickly is, in terms of the contribution on the volume basis from the Colorado aggregate acquisitions, can you just give a sense of what those are going to bring on in terms of production or realized volumes in 2016?
Howard Nye: I can give you a sense of that. I mean we are looking for probably about 1.5 million tons out of that business. Again, what we picked up there, Ted, and what we are very careful that we are trying to do, it goes back to what we said out in our shore process. Our strategic planning. We wanted to make sure we had leading positions in attractive regions. That’s what we have done. We wanted to make sure that we were getting generational types of deposits in those areas. That’s what we have done with nearly 1 billion tons in that market place. Here is an important note for us to consider because we haven't had a reason to talk to you about this in the past, but actually in November, voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and use tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that’s going to generate about $250 million over five years just in Southern Colorado. So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of about $90 million. EBITDA margins of probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it. It's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it and we brought it up with that very capable team that we have in Denver. I don’t have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up, I think in trajectory in a much more quick timeframe then they did for us originally in Denver. Which by the way, I don’t think anyone ever complained about. So, again, call it $90 million in net sales, EBITDA margins of 17%-20%, probably about 1.5 million tons of [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from James Armstrong with Vertical Research.
James Armstrong: The first one is, could you help us understand how to get comfortable with the 7% pricing guidance for 2016? Specifically, do you have any contracts in hand that really lead you to believe that the 7% in aggregates is in hand and with the type of volume you're talking about, could it be conservative?
Howard Nye: You know what, I guess what I would say is this. The wonderful thing about the pricing story in our industry is that I think this has held together so remarkably well, all the way through a downturn. Our sense has long been that as we hit an upturn, the pricing story works even better. I think that’s what we are seeing. I think the other thing that I would say is one of the earlier comments I made was, we see that eastern United States recovering now at a faster rate than we have seen for a while. Eastern quarries are higher priced quarries. So I guess what I would say is this, to your question very specifically, James. I don’t have any concerns about being able to at least make sure we get our pricing. If I worry about things, if I have got a worrying list from 1 to 100, I will put pricing clearly at 101. So I have got a lot of confidence around that. And, again, depending on what's some of the geographic mix looks like, I will leave it to your observations on whether there could be upside in that but we certainly put a range out there that we have a degree of confidence on.
James Armstrong: That helps. Two follow ups. Are you seeing any ability to ship further as diesel prices fall?
Howard Nye: You know, I am sure people could. Here's what I think is more of an issue. I think the barriers to entry and the regulatory environment in which we operate have gotten so difficult that the notion of trying to ship product farther and deplete quarries faster is not something that I think most competitors are interest in doing. So I think with cheaper diesel, could it happen? I suppose math could say it could happen. Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I am concerned about it? Not really at all. I think the other practical matter is two-fold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace. Just finding them. And then number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they are looking for. So I think you have got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone further a bit of an anathema. And then I think you have also got a driver situation that makes it even more of a challenge. So today not an issue and really would not anticipate it being an issue this year.
James Armstrong: That helps. And then lastly, is there a debt level you're comfortable at? And at what debt level to EBITDA ratio would you be comfortable taking out to buy back stock?
Howard Nye: Let me turn to Anne to talk about.
Anne Lloyd: James, as we have indicated pretty consistently, we have said we would keep a minimum two times debt to EBITDA. Obviously at the end of 2015 we ended at a net debt of 1.9 times. We have indicated we would keep that level of debt and then that we would continue to use excess cash over and above what we use both for organic and inorganic capital and use that in the form to buy back shares during the course of the year. So therefore, I think if you could think about it that we likely are much more active in that market as we move through the second quarter and into the second half of the year. As we have indicated in the press release, we have used our available funds to produce some acquisitions in the business.
Howard Nye: You know, James, one thing to remember. We like these acquisitions we have just done in Denver a lot. The other thing that we will say is, we like ourselves a lot. We feel like we have got a good business. So the fact is we believe this business continues to delever very, very quickly. And if we like ourselves when we are $30 a share higher than we are now, so we really like ourselves a lot right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois: First question is on your cement pricing guidance. I'm just wondering if you can talk about how much of the price improvement that you're anticipating in 2016 is driven by improved mix in the lower priced TXI contracts rolling off as opposed to securing a meaningful portion of the April price increase. Because as we think about cement pricing in general, correct me if I'm wrong, it does take a little bit of time to be fully realized in earnings. So, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the price progression in 2016 and the different components.
Howard Nye: Garik, you said it exactly right. Number one, to go back to your initial question. Really, almost all of the legacy TXI facilities, those contracts are gone. So in large part what we are talking about here on these price increases, are real price increases. And that’s what we anticipate putting into the marketplace, in North Texas and South Texas. Now, again, I think it's going to be easier in many respects to get price in North Texas than in South Texas. So I think we will see it in both. I think we will get it in both but it is going to be easier in North. And I agree with you as well, we are going to have some of our own contracts that we need to work through. And part of what I have try to do in the telecon is give some color around how that would play out over the year and put some specific percentages to it. But I mean, would we go in and put all dollars across the board on everything this year? No, we won't because we do have to work through our own. But at least at this point, Garik, it is our own contracts that we are working off and not TXI legacy contracts. Does that help?
Garik Shmois: Yes. It does.
Anne Lloyd: And you can see Garik where the pricing is at the end of 2015 such that by the end of the year, the guidance that we have provided you on average selling price per ton is kind of give you a sense of the trajectory of realization through the course of the year.
Garik Shmois: Yes, of course. Thank you for that. Two more questions, if I could. Just a point of clarification on the volumes that you picked up, the 1.5 million tons in Colorado. Just want to make clear that whether or not that is included in your volume guidance for the full year, the 164 million to 167 million tons.
Howard Nye: Short answer is, no, it's not, Garik.
Garik Shmois: Okay. And then lastly, in magnesia specialties, this is calling for growth in 2016. Fourth quarter did see some deceleration, steel markets remain challenged. Just wondering if you could walk us through your underlying assumptions in that business and what gives you the confidence that the market will turn around?
Howard Nye: Now, I guess a couple of things. One, if we are looking at where the American Iron and Steel Institute is right now relative to their forecast, they are basically seeing steel at a 70% utilization rate. And if you recall going back over time, that’s been the point that we said was really an important one for this business. So if we are 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. The other input that’s important to remember is we are going to end up having a decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what Nat gas did last year for the year, is 28% lower. Even if we look for the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So, again, if we are going into the year and the Steel Institute is right, it's 70%, that’s hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful. To the extent that that business comes under pressure, the thing that I would tell you too is, there is no team that we have in this company that’s better at managing costs and managing their cost profile in our magnesia specialties business. So when I go back to Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress, and again I am not thinking that it will but even if it did, I think you are looking at a business that’s still going to have a margin in the low 30s. And from where I am sitting, if we have got a low 30 margin, I will take it as a [gain] [ph].
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: So with the pent-up demand that you were talking about from weather, how quickly could that come through, Ward? Should that impact 1Q or, really just trying to think about quarterly cadence of volume.
Howard Nye: You know, I guess I would think of it in these terms. Could it affect Q1? I suppose it could affect Q1. But remember what we've always said about Q1. Q1 is either made or broken in the last two weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. The other thing to remember, and we tried to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we are going to have that shale headwind at least in the Southwest throughout the first half of the year. But I think that clearly goes away once we're through with the first half. That said, here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to have aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean that's my quick math. If we want to say there with weather deferral of, call it 3.5 million, 4 million tons, then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take you down another 1.5 million tons in that first half. And then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it it'll be just Fine, it's that transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And any time you do a shift like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, I could see 2016 Ag volume at that 7% end of our range, 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was a pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather and I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you would expect. And then Q4 we went back to building the ark. So the fact is, if we end up with a good Q1 in normal weather, I think we would be very very pleased with that given what will be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?
Trey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. Very helpful color. Thank you, Ward. And then on ready mix, you mentioned a couple of times that you're expecting a much better year for ready mix. That segment's already -- well, the downstream is already putting up some pretty good margins. What's driving the big margin improvement you're expecting there specifically in ready mix? Is that primarily material spread improvement, or are there other drivers there that could be moving the needle?
Howard Nye: You know what, it's going to be spread, it's going to be primarily efficiencies. It's going to be more volume. The fact is, you could see, probably 900,000 cubic yards more volume in that business in Texas than we saw last year. I think the other piece of it is, part of what we're seeing on some contracts now that are coming in in that South Texas area. We have talked about those large projects, like [indiscernible] and others. So the fact is, we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going this year as well. I think just better cost, better efficiency. Here's an interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean at some point late in the fourth quarter, we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who is trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured. Because the four other times we have been ready to deliver concrete to the site, he couldn't take it because the site was so wet. That's the type of backlog and back-build that we see in that business. So, that type of carryover, much better efficiency, new contracts going and what we think will be continued price leadership in that market gives us the type of confidence we have in ready mix.
Trey Grooms: That's very encouraging. Last one from me. On the share movement you mentioned in cement, the 325,000 tons, do you feel like that has pretty well run its course? I know the TXI legacy contracts have all rolled off. Do you feel like that's pretty well behind us at this point?
Howard Nye: You know what, I think we're working our way through that. I think that -- and I've always thought probably by the time we got to the end of Q1, it will have shaken itself out. The fact is, I go back in time and reflect on what TXI had done when they brought on more capacity prior to our ownership and then that worked itself out as well. Candidly, I think that's a little bit of what we've seen, particularly in North Texas. And I think to the extent that Argos really becomes more of a self supplier with their own cement in South Texas, I think those two bring the type of stabilizing effect that I would expect in both of those markets this year.
Trey Grooms: So, you still think kind of end of Q1, is the target on that?
Howard Nye: Yes. I do.
Trey Grooms: Okay. And just if I could sneak one more in for Anne. Just kind of housekeeping here for modeling. The $102.44 you announced on cement pricing for the quarter, is that basically where you ended the quarter for pricing there in cement?
Anne Lloyd: Effectively, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.
Timna Tanners: I wanted to just touch base on the additional cement risk potential if the dollar continues to strengthen. How would you frame that risk or what extent do you see there?
Howard Nye: You know what, I've got to tell you, I don't see the dollar strength as really being a big component of that. I mean most of the imports that could come into Texas are coming in through Texas through people who are domestic producers there. Argos is the exception, and Argos has really tapped out at 500,000 tons coming in through Houston. So, I don't see that as really something that I believe would be a driving force in that market, Timna.
Timna Tanners: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I know you talked a lot about M&A being an important focus as of the investor day and I just wonder if you could update us on how you're seeing opportunities there. Valuations, appetite? And if you would have to expand from your current geographies or if there's more opportunities from where you're already positioned.
Howard Nye: I guess, what I would say is there continues to be a lot of just broad, general activity in M&A, period. I think we're seeing more approaches and we're having more approaches to others than we've seen in a while. I would expect that to persist. I think the notion of private companies seeing, hey, I've got a five year highway bill, it looks more aggregate intensive. This is probably not a bad place for us to ask somebody to jump off on a modeling tour. In their minds it's probably not a bad place to be. Part of what I liked about the deals that we've just done is we were able to do those within EBITDA multiple ranges that make a lot of sense for our business. We are picking up hard rock reserves at the end of the day for what we feel like could be tonnage prices at times for sand and gravel type reserves. You shouldn't expect us to be looking at M&A in marketplaces that really are outside of where we are, unless we have the ability to go into a new marketplace either as a leader or with what we feel like is a clear executable plan to be a leader. And what I would always draw you back to, is what we did in Colorado in 2011. We went into that market with the swap that we did with Lafarge and the other transactions that we did literally back to back, and put ourselves overnight in a leadership position and really have extended that march with this latest transaction. But going into an attractive market and being a onesy-twosy in it and really not having a good way to become a leader in that marketplace, is not consistent with our strategy. So I wanted to articulate that to you because as you watch for us to grow, those really should be the boundaries to it.
Timna Tanners: Got it. Okay. And the last one, if I could. I just want to clarify what you said. I was confused on the magnesia specialties segment because utilization lately in steel saw another like 72% as of last year and it's 72% or so now. So is it fair to say that at the same utilization you would make the same profits or is there other driving forces that we should be aware of?
Howard Nye: No, the same utilization, would be the same profit. I guess what I'm saying, last year -we've got to be careful when I say last year because we're between years...
Anne Lloyd: 2015.
Howard Nye: In 2014, it was 78%. In 2015, it was 72%. So, what we're saying is, we think it's probably going to be around that 70%. That's certainly what we are hearing right now. And if it stays there, we're going to see something that feels relatively consistent. I think, back to your question, Timna.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Brandon Jaffe: This is actually Brandon Jaffe on behalf of Jerry. Can you talk about how aggregates price increases for January 1 this year compare to last year and maybe how you expect the pricing cadence to play out? If I'm not mistaken, you had a bigger January 1 increase last year than typical seasonality would suggest, and also you had lower mid-year prices throughout the year.
Howard Nye: Well, What I would tell you is, we've gone to the market pretty consistently with what we feel like the pricing needs to be. And I've seen pricing anywhere on the low end from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to in some places $1.50 a ton, or more in some instances. I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI. Part of what we said was TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average and we said we thought it would probably take about three years to get that closer to our corporate average. Mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now, TXI is about 75% of our corporate average. So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. Would I expect us to come back and talk about mid-year price increases again this year? The short answer is I would. If we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure type work, honestly, I think you could find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17 that in some markets you could be short on some products. That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas with respect to sand in particular. Again, I think the rhythm of it will be, you'll see most prices in effect January 1. In some places, you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. The long and short answer is, that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about mid-year price increases but I think customers should expect those conversations.
Brandon Jaffe: Great. And then on the TXI cement business, now that you've had more time to run those assets, can you talk about the opportunities you see there to invest in that business? And maybe update us on the cement CapEx plans currently compared to what you laid out at the last analyst day?
Howard Nye: No, I don't think the CapEx plans have changed materially since the last analyst day. I mean part of what we said that we could do, and we were talking at that point not just about the Texas plants, we were talking about California plants as well, because we were saying that we could take our capacity up over time. And, clearly, we're still believing that that's going to be the case. This year in Texas, we're probably looking, I'm trying to remember exactly what we're looking at for -- try to give me one second on the additions this year -- I'm going to have to come back and probably talk to you about that offline.
Brandon Jaffe: No problem.
Howard Nye: But, really, if we're looking, I can give you a good sense of what we're looking at on the kiln expenses for the year. That's probably a very worthy number for you to have right now. So if we're looking at kiln expenses for the year on downtime, and these are important numbers, we're looking probably in Q1 at about $6.6 million. We're looking in Q2 at about $3.7 million. We're looking in Q3 at about $2 million. And Q4 is always the heavy quarter, that's going to be right at almost $11 million-$10.9 million. And I now have found what I was looking for. I apologize for that delay. Relative to capital, what we had said we would do, is we would add some additions because of capital in 2015 and add about 200,000 additional tons at Hunter and about 50,000 additional tons at Midlothian. And then what we had spelled out at analyst day and beyond is that we thought we would come back in '16, and these are in our capital plans by the way, and add an additional 140,000 tons at Hunter, again, that's in San Antonio. Which brings you, if we're looking 2017 through the additional tonnage that we're looking to add, it would put us at capacity in Texas of 4.75 million tons. So, there's your build.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays.
Stephen Kim: Most of my questions have been answered. But earlier in the year, we heard you guys talking about labor constraints, particularly on the ready mix side. And I guess with all the rainy weather, it really wasn't much of an issue. But I was curious if you had any insight into how that situation has developed. Has it improved, do you sense? Because I assume that part of the 3.5 million-4 million catch up or deferment into Q1 would presume that you're going to be able to see some of those labor constraints to not return or intensify. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there on the labor side?
Howard Nye: Sure. I mean if you go back particularly in Texas and then look at what was going on in that marketplace, a lot of it tied back into what we talked about earlier, and that is simply what's going on with drivers or what's not going on with drivers. So a lot of drivers were, frankly, engaged in what was going on in the shale fields at the time. What's happening now is you've got more drivers who are available. But here's the other piece of it that's important, and we went through this very carefully last October when we were going through our planning cycle. Our two ready mix businesses are in Colorado and Texas and what we were hearing from both of those groups is, if we could get more trucks, then we would have the ability to come back and safely serve the market in the most efficient way that we could. And the short answer is, at this point we think we're able to, one, put more trucks in, in a thoughtful way. Number two, put drivers in those trucks, and three, be in a position, both in the Rocky Mountains as well as in the Metroplex, and I think that's going to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times. So, I do think from a capital perspective we're where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective, it's going to feel in our world much better in 2016 than it did in 2015. In large part, if you just look at the rhythm and the cadence of what has happened in those shale fields. Remember what we were talking about in some of the earlier conversations about what it looked like last year, Q1 in the shale fields and what it looks like this year. And I think we'll certainly be able to meet that demand.
Stephen Kim: Got it. That's very helpful. Then, just lastly, I know that resi isn't a super high percentage of your business but it's still almost 20%, I would guess. You talked a little bit about, I think you put double-digit type numbers that you're forecasting and I think you talked about reference permits being strong. Obviously in Texas, I was curious, there's some concerns obviously about what permits might do in Texas. If you could just talk a little bit about what your guidance is assuming in terms of permit activity in Texas.
Howard Nye: Let's talk about it in a number of different ways. Number one, permit activity that we see are up 12%, starts are up 11% and completions up 9%. So, you've still got more starts than completions, which we feel like is an attractive place to be. I think as we look at what most forecasts are saying for 2016, they are looking for starts up around, I think 1.25 million starts number. That's up around 13%. I think most people, now this is getting farther out, are looking for starts to be up another 10% even as we go into '17. So if we look at Texas, more specifically to your question, Texas ranked number four in housing permit activity. Dallas/Fort Worth, which is our single largest market in Texas, is ranking second in housing permits and to us that continues to indicate good future strength in that market. The other thing that's remarkable to look at, if you look at residential units in 2015 in Dallas, what I'm seeing is data that reveals there's about 43,000 unit starts. If you look at Houston's Sugar Land, there's around 51,000 starts. You put those two together, that's almost 10% of total starts in the United States. And we're not seeing any slowdown in North Texas at all right now. And the fact is, housing inventory in Houston is still at about four months.
Anne Lloyd: And, Stephen, I would just add just as a point of clarification, residential is about 15% of our end use which is actually a very healthy percentage. At prior peak we knocked on the door of 20%, 22%, which kicked it a little bit out of balance. So, we feel like we're still in that, quite honestly, good sweet spot in the residential activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Betts with Jefferies.
Mike Betts: The only question I've got left is on the asphalt and I guess it's a two or three parter. You've obviously sold the San Antonio asphalt business. I see that volumes are down 45% in Q4 in the external sales in asphalt. Is that entirely due to that disposal or is that due to weather or contracts ending or anything like that? I guess, what I'm really after is some guidance as to how much volume has gone with that disposal for the nine months that won't be in the next year. And then just finally on the asphalt business, can you talk about the strategy for what you've got left there? I mean are you looking to exit it because it is quite small now.
Howard Nye: Mike, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. A few years ago, we had an asphalt business in Arkansas which we no longer have. So that was sold about a year and a half ago. Number two, what we did sell was basically an FOB asphalt business that was in San Antonio. Here's the quick answer on that. We weren't the best owner of it. We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it 700,000 tons a year. So the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver, and to Denver it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. So we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that marketplace is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates, they tend to be in ready mix and they tend to be in hot mix. We don't see it changing in that part of the world. And as we sit here today, Mike, that's the only place that we have asphalt left.
Mike Betts: So the acquisition in Colorado, will that add further significant asphalt volumes?
Howard Nye: It does add some asphalt volume. Again, it tends to be an aggregates led business. You're looking at probably about 340,000 tons in that southern Front Range marketplace that came with these transactions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.
Craig Bibb: Congratulations on opening the Medina quarry. That's a big deal. Could you give us a little color on the impact on production volume, profitability both in '16 and beyond?
Howard Nye: You know what as we said, that's going to be about 6 million tons coming out of there. It's the largest quarry in the UP network. It's going to be going principally into Houston and South Texas. The primary issue that you've got there is that's going to be an area of the state that's going to be starved for DOT specification stone. So number one, it's going to be a highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. The other thing that it does, Craig, and this is important, if you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckman quarry. Beckman, for several times over the last decade has been the largest producing quarry in the United States and it's almost situated in Metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate, San Antonio's actually the second largest city in Texas. Houston is largest. San Antonio is number two. San Antonio is larger than Dallas. And our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckman quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry and to make sure we've got that quarry there for another 20-plus years. And we were also in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig, but again, the strategy and the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expected that plant to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go. As you recall, we've got several hundred car unit facilities not just in Houston but throughout South Texas and that's where that material is going.
Anne Lloyd: And just as a point of clarification, Craig. As Ward indicated in the teleconference script, that 6 million tons is actually just replacing tonnage. We're going to lower the tonnage at the Beckman quarry and move it through Medina. And as you look forward, that Medina quarry is capable of producing up to 10 million tons but that is probably a couple years out.
Craig Bibb: How many years of reserves are left at Beckman? I mean are we...
Howard Nye: We would expect to be at Beckman for another couple of decades.
Craig Bibb: Okay. You often highlight Georgia as an area where you dramatically added to your asset base during the downturn. I think Vulcan mentioned something like 22% same store volume in Georgia. Could you maybe give us a little more color there? It looks like there could be a lot of leverage.
Howard Nye: What I'll tell you is, it's funny to look at some of those numbers because the numbers look and feel awfully familiar. So what I would tell you is that what I read in the transcript from Vulcan relative to Georgia looked very similar. I think we saw them up 23%ish.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And then lastly, with magnesia specialty, what happens if utilization falls below 70%?
Howard Nye: Then I think what you'll see is they will go into another mode of cost containment. And I think that really goes back to the point that I was raising before. Maybe you go from mid-30s to low 30s or high 20s on the gross margin. Still, a very very attractive business even if that occurs.
Operator: And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nye.
Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Again, we are confident entering 2016, as I hope you can glean from our comments. We see strong employment growth in our key states, solid construction activity with increased materials demand and attractive pricing opportunities. We look forward to discussing our first quarter results with you in May and, importantly, seeing you at our recently announced investor and analyst day on May 9 in Dallas, Texas. We hope we'll see you then. Thank you very much and thanks for your support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta third quarter 2015 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. By any measure, this was an outstanding quarter for us. We recorded record net sales, gross profit, and net earnings. Our performance in the third quarter reflects some basic realities about today's Martin Marietta, namely the growing demand for construction materials, coupled with our operational excellence and synergy realization, has enabled us to generate net sales that exceeded $1 billion, a milestone for us, as well as achieve our stated incremental margin objective by delivering $0.77 of gross profit on each incremental dollar of net sales over the prior-year quarter. Further to that point, we believe that we're in the beginning stages of a construction-centric recovery that's taking place in our country and, most importantly for us, in those markets we serve. As a result, we see further opportunities to increase our sales, profits, and cash flow in the coming months and even years. The past quarter also saw us complete the sale of our California cement operations in a cash transaction for $420 million. In anticipation of the proceeds from the sale, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock during the third quarter, giving us the opportunity to further enhance shareholder value. We anticipate returning the remaining net proceeds to shareholders with additional stock repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. Before we discuss third quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe this provides meaningful data to better analyze our third quarter performance. Let me briefly summarize the supplemental information. Slide 2 provides comparative net sales and gross profit, which helps illustrate our profit trajectory. Slides 3 and 4 provide product line volume and pricing metrics. We're pleased to report solid growth in each product line. Finally, slide 5 provides a roll-forward of our earnings from operations. Now let's delve into some of the underlying details that support these metrics. Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market account for approximately 43% of total volumes and increased more than 5% compared with the prior-year quarter. We're encouraged to see states take increased responsibility for funding infrastructure investment. In fact, highway awards for the trailing 12 months through July were at their high levels since 2000, with major project activity continuing to accelerate in the Southeastern United States and Texas. Additionally, today, voters in Texas are expected to pass Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an additional $2.5 billion annually for non-toll road projects beginning in 2017. Last week, federal highway funding was extended to November 20, with the passage of the 35th short-term patch since 2008. The roughly three-week duration of this continuing resolution increases our optimism regarding the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill this year, a move that has bipartisan support in Congress and which the President has indicated his willingness to sign. To that effect on October 18, Congressman Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, introduced the $325 billion Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act. This means that, together with the Senate's previously announced Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy Act, or DRIVE, for the first time in over a decade, both chambers of Congress are readying to advance multiyear federal highway bills. Should a federal highway bill be passed before the end of the year, any meaningful impact on our business would not be expected prior to the second half of 2016, but clearly its positive impact will be felt for several years thereafter. The nonresidential end use market is comprised of two components: light construction and heavy construction. The light nonresidential construction component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with these drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volume increased 29%. Importantly, each reportable group achieved double-digit growth in this component of construction, with the largest percentage increase being reported in the Southeast division. Light nonresidential shipments are benefiting from low energy prices and years of steady employment growth. In fact, non-farm employment in the United States is currently about 4 million jobs above the pre-recession peak. The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building, as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 21% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and declined 9% compared with the third quarter of 2014. As expected, shale energy-related volumes were down versus the prior-year quarter. However, we expect large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects during the remainder of the year and early 2016 to offset the decline in direct shale exploration activity. Despite the reduction in shale-related shipments, domestic crude oil production is projected to reach 9.25 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of more than 500,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels, all evidence of continuing energy sector transformation in the United States. Nonresidential construction activity continues to vary by location. Texas again led the nation, with more than $24 billion of starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Significant growth is also being experienced in key Southeastern states, including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Our leading positions in these markets should allow us to capitalize on these opportunities. The residential end use market represented 18% of our aggregate shipments and increased 15% compared with the prior-year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be in line with the trend in housing starts. Texas leads the nation in single-family unit starts, while Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina, and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 in growth for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the third quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our third quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were up 7%, attributable to increased railroad ballast shipments, which in part are driven by deferred maintenance from prior years, when rail congestion and weather hindered such activity. Aggregates products line pricing increased in all reportable groups, led by the West Group, consistent with our stated expectations. Overall, we achieved a 5% increase. Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped was down slightly, with lower energy prices benefiting the cost structure. On average, we paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.09 in the prior-year quarter, contributing to an $11 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the entire company. During the first nine months of the year, we have recognized a total of $16 million in diesel fuel savings despite a 22% increase in consumption, driven by economic growth and in the TXI acquisition. The aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by almost $13 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mix concrete product line reported a 19% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average selling price. Gross profit for the Aggregates business increased $60 million and resulted in a gross margin increase of 500 basis points over the prior-year quarter to 25.3% of net sales. In fact, we're very pleased to note that all of our reportable business segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by a 780-basis-point increase in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. We expect further recovery to provide opportunities to expand profitability towards historical levels for the Southeast Group. Overall, our Aggregates business exceeded our publicly stated target and generated an incremental gross margin of 68%. The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $57 million and a gross margin of 34%. For the quarter, the business's earnings from operations were $17 million, a slight decline compared with the prior year. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production. Our third quarter Cement business results are impressive. Gross profit increased $14 million, as a 16% increase in average selling price to nearly $100 per ton and synergy realization more than offset volume declines. Gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to 34.5%. For the quarter, the business incurred almost $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs which, as expected, will likely double in the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, the Cement business shipped 1.1 million tons to external customers. Over 70% or 138,000 tons of the decline in cement shipments during the quarter resulted from the sale of the California cement business. Upon announcement of the sale of that business, as expected, certain customers realigned their volumes to other suppliers. Excluding the California sale impact, cement shipments declined 4%, with half resulting from a loss of direct shipments to the energy sector and the other half from the well-publicized introduction of new cement capacity in Texas. We remain diligent in achieving margin growth through a disciplined price structure. The aim is, as ever, to increase profitability and shareholder value. The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts a favorable supply/demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years, with continuing growth on an annual basis through 2019. We believe this forecast supports continued resilient growth. In that regard, it's important to recognize and understand the diversity of the Texas economy. Today's Texas is not the Texas of the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the Texas construction sector was overbuilt. On average from 1982 to 1984, when there were nearly 11 million fewer people living in Texas, annual housing permits were approximately 75,000 higher than during 2012 to 2014. Importantly, too, over the last decade, Texas has led the United States in terms of job growth, creating 30% of new jobs across the country. This has led to near-continuous positive net migration to the state, a trend that's expected to continue. In addition to increased housing demands in the state, infrastructure spending, which represents our most aggregates-intensive end use, is also crucial to continued growth. The strong Texas Department of Transportation budget, coupled with the expected Proposition 7 annual contribution to state transportation initiatives, should continue to provide a solid foundation for construction materials demand and extend the growth trajectory in Texas. Moving back to our quarterly results, consolidated selling, general, and administrative, or SG&A, expenses were 5.5% of net sales. The increase of 20 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter reflects the impact of higher pension expense. For the quarter, we incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate. In connection with the California cement business divestiture, we recorded a loss on the sale of $25 million and also incurred nearly $4 million of related expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring loss and related charges, our adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $208 million, an improvement of 36% over the prior-year quarter's adjusted earnings from operations of $153 million. For the first nine months of the year, we generated $320 million of operating cash flow, compared with the $202 million in 2014. The 58% increase is due to higher earnings, partially offset by working capital needs in 2015. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project which we believe will be complete on time by year-end. On year-to-date basis, we've returned $339 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares in total. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015 was 2.2 times, in compliance with our leveraged covenant and within our targeted range. As we look ahead to completing a successful year, we expect consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, or EBITDA, to range from $800 million to $820 million, exclusive of the one-time loss on the sale of the California cement business. The range also assumes we do not experience an early onset of winter weather in our key markets, thereby ending the construction season prematurely. This represents the most significant risk for our fourth quarter performance. As you're likely aware, recent weather events in South Carolina and Texas have affected activity. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on fourth quarter results. However, operational inefficiencies, if not offset by demand, could affect results. We have also started to frame our preliminary end use outlook for 2016, based on our internal observations and external data published by Dodge Data & Analytics and The Portland Cement Association. We currently expect modest growth in the infrastructure and nonresidential markets and double-digit growth in the residential market. ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be relatively flat. Cement demand in Texas is expected to increase 4% over 2015 levels. Our forecast does not reflect any major benefit that would come from the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill, as there will be a long lag time – or a lag time – before a bill provides meaningful impact to our business. Thus, the positive impact would occur beyond 2016. To conclude, we continue to be excited about the future of Martin Marietta. We believe we're at the beginning stage of a construction-centric recovery in many of our key markets, and we're extremely advantageously positioned to benefit from the expected upturn. Additionally, our third quarter results illustrate our growth trajectory when price, volume, and costs are all favorable. We're focused on the execution of our strategic plan while remaining committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. These pillars should lead to increased shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Thank you for taking my questions today. I guess, first wanted to focus on your outlook by end market in 2016. And that outlook is a little bit more muted, I think, than we and others had expected. How should we think about margins, in particular incremental gross margins, on a go-forward basis, given the strong incrementals you reported in the quarter and against the backdrop of maybe a little bit more muted end market growth in 2016? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about it in two different ways. Let's talk about the outlook; then let's talk about really what margins are going to look like, because we're all talking about growth. We're is talking about how much growth there's going to be. Because as I'm sitting here looking at what I think next year looks like, I think it's some of the best outlook we've seen in years. We have broad-based state DOT initiatives that are in place. We have residential reacceleration under way. We see good private sector, nonresidential work. There're some huge non-building projects, and what I think will be continued great pricing dynamics. But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about margin, Kathryn. Here's a great way, I think, to think of it. If we look at the margins that we kicked out in our business – incremental 77% across the business; you see what we did on the Aggregate space all by itself – here's a way to think of it. For the quarter – I'm looking at heritage tonnage right now. For the quarter, our heritage aggregates tonnage was 42.8 million. Last year, for the similar quarter, 40.6 million. So a couple million tons. Let's look at it through nine months. 106.5 million versus 104.3 million. Any way you look at it, it's about 2 million tons. Let's put that in context, and I think it helps with the margin. 2 million tons is about the size of what I would think is a really good quarry. One quarry. Here's the difference. That profit increased for the quarter – from those 2 million tons – for the quarter was $30 million. The profit increase through the nine months for those 2 million tons was $85 million. Remember what my comments were at the end of the commentary: When you have volume, price, and cost all working in the right direction, it's very powerful. Part of what we said on the incremental margins is when we get to the point that we've recovered half of the volume that we lost in the downturn – and remember, that was 80 million tons – we thought we'd see on average 60% incrementals in the business, and clearly what we're seeing right now on the rolled-up business is far better than that. If we're back to the notion of being at the beginning innings of a construction-centric recovery, and you're seeing that type of profitability over that small amount of tonnage – and keep in mind what this means, Kathryn. This is not with our most profitable business well yet. This is with our most profitable business starting to get well in Georgia and Florida and North Carolina. So if we see the type of acceleration in those markets that I hope we'll see, then the types of margins that you've seen in this quarter and otherwise I believe will continue to replicate themselves, and we're more than comfortable with that 60% margin that we put out there. That's a long answer, but your question's a good one. I wanted to be thorough with the response.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: That's helpful. Toward the end, you were just – I wanted to tag onto that regional focus. What are you seeing in terms of demand, either on a state-by-state or, broadly speaking, region-by-region basis? And if there are any differences in – maybe you could focus a little bit more on the nonres end market and bifurcate between what's really more heavy industrial versus just traditional light commercial. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kathryn. Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look at Colorado as a front-running state right now with a lot of room ahead of it. The employment picture in Colorado is very good. Denver's ranked 23rd nationally. There's a private sector that's really very strong. It's ranked 11th in housing starts. Their DOT program remains remarkably attractive. That's up 9% for the trailing 12 months. And, again, what we're seeing there in downstream pricing continues to be very good. I think what our team in that marketplace has done with the ready mixed business is really impressive. If we come farther south and take a look at what's going on in Texas, remember, it's third in employment. It's up almost 900,000 jobs over the last 36 months. We've got I-35 in North Texas, going – DFW and – Dallas and Fort Worth, and obviously, the Grand Parkway in Houston. And then we've got what we believe is going to be the coming of the $2.5 billion really hitting in 2017 coming from Proposition 7. Another state or two to think about, as long as we're still west of the Mississippi, are both Iowa and Nebraska. And Iowa has been a remarkably consistent performer for us. But here's the pop we're going to see in Iowa: We're seeing higher gas taxes there. We're going to see DOT dollars up 30%, and we see a farm economy there this year that, while some portions of the farm economy in fairness are down, we are seeing tremendous yields in the farm economy. So when we come back and look at tremendous yields on what that could mean into Q4 or Q1, again, weather dependent, very good ag lime circumstances. If we transition across the Mississippi River – let's talk about Florida for a second. Very – very positive, all segments are up, number two in job growth, very strong DOT program, number one in residential, and number four in nonres, which I know you asked me about. We'll hit more about that in just a second. The state of Georgia, I believe, finally, finally is starting to hit its stride. It's lagged Florida just a bit, but right now, it's number nine in job growth. It's number three in residential. We're seeing a double of the DOT in that state, and we're going to start to feel that impact really even more profoundly late in 2016, and the TSPLOST program in South Georgia puts some much-needed volume in that part of the state. And then lastly, but certainly not least, is what we're seeing here in our home state of North Carolina. What I would tell you is that state's really up and coming right now, number five in employment. It's just passed Georgia, in fact. It's number eight in single-family. And what we're looking at right now on a trailing 12 months, at least through August, is we're seeing DOT awards up almost 47%, and we're seeing good work come up on the HOT lanes in Charlotte right now. So, if we look at those six states that are disproportionately important to us right now, I think that gives you a pretty good sense of where it is. Now, the other part of your question, Kathryn, that I want to try to answer is really what's going on with nonres, because, again, if we're giving the sense that nonres is still, that's not a sense that we're trying to give. Nonres, particularly on the heavy side – and I think that's where your question was – tend to be good, long-term, multiyear jobs. So think of it in these terms, that we're looking at nonres construction, again, on a trailing 12-month-basis, Florida is up 40%, North Carolina is up 18%, South Carolina is up 31%, and Colorado, which began its recovery well ahead of others, is up 7%. At the same time, if we look at some of those states and same percentage over a three-year period – and again I say that because they're multiyear – Florida up 54%, North Carolina up 11%, Georgia up 24%, and Texas up 85%. So, again, if we're looking at heavy construction with years of tail to it, I think it's got a pretty good story. And then obviously the story of the quarter relative to the light side of it, that tends to follow housing, was really a very attractive quarter. And again in the states that we believe are disproportionately important to us, we think will continue to be a good story. Did I hit what you needed on that?
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Yep, you did. Thank you very much for answering my questions today. I'll hop back in the queue.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: Thanks. Afternoon, Ward and Anne.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Todd.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Todd.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: I want to circle back on that last question and that last answer, Ward, because I hear you on the amount of work that there is on the heavy side. This is specifically with regard to nonres ...
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: ...and on the fact that you're seeing the lighter nonres kind of follow through and certainly a good performance in 3Q. But, I mean, that is where you trimmed the guidance for the year, and the preliminary outlook for next year has kind of a slower pace of growth implied than what you've seen this year in nonres, going from sort of – we were at high single digits, now we're at low to mid single digits. I can't remember exactly. And then you're talking about sort of slight growth next year. So what's the disconnect? I mean, why are we seeing a deceleration there?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think you're just talking about what we're looking at relative to new projects. If you're looking at what's there and the volumes that we're likely to see on existing projects, again, that are multiyear, Todd, I think you're going to see a host of very strong multiyear projects that are already on the books. So really what I would tell you is this: are we seeing a bit of a slowing in the trajectory of some of the growth in Texas? I think the answer is yes. But if you're looking at the numbers and the way growth has been in that state over the last several years, it's been so heady that it almost has to naturally pull back while it's still growing. Now, here's where I think the wildcard is. If you want to tell me or others want to say, you know what, I think it's getting better in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida and South Carolina more quickly than you're saying, I'll take that, because I think there's going to be nice growth in those states as well. But, again, if you start seeing a higher rate of growth in heavy nonres in the Eastern United States, that's really going to be the swing factor in some of this. Because I think when we go to Texas and simply look at what's going on there, or Colorado or Iowa or others, it's going to continue to be very healthy. We're simply talking about rates of growth, and we're already seeing volumes in some of those states that are at very, very good levels. So if you're doing a compare across our geography and trying to sort out where is there, candidly, continued room for growth, it's in the East much more so than it is in the West. And the East has been a slower, steady growth pattern, really for the last two years, and you can see what the result is on the bottom line this year.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: Well, that's – so thanks for that, and that is very interesting and leads us in interesting places. So if you're saying that you're going to basically see a handoff from growth in the West toward growth in the East, remind me, your margins and your average prices on aggregates are much higher in the East in general than they are in the West. Is that still true?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That would still be true.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: So that, going back to Kathryn's original question, would imply a bit of a, all else equal, a bit of a tailwind on price and margin and things like that next year, if in fact that's happening.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Todd, I think that's true. I mean, the pricing in the East has always been higher than it's been in the West. And, look, do we want to see as much volume go as possible? We absolutely do. The primary thing we really want to do is make sure that we continue to make more money and deliver more value for our shareholders. And what I would suggest to you, I think the results from the quarter are spectacular. I think what we're having this year is an outstanding year. I think we're going to have a better year next year, and I think the parts of the country, to your point, that have historically been our most profitable parts of the country are continuing to get better. And I think the level at which they're getting better is starting to outpace other parts of the country. And by the way, they're overdue. That's not a surprise.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: Excellent. Thanks for that. Second question, we've heard some other companies and private companies – I've asked this question a couple times today – talk about bottlenecks in parts of their business from labor generally at their customers, whether it's concrete finishing crews or framing crews or what have you. Is that something that you are seeing in your business?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, Todd, it absolutely, positively is. And probably the parts of the country where you have less labor issues than others might be in parts of South Texas, where you have some of the people who are directly involved in energy not necessarily directly involved in some of that work. But if we're in Colorado, it's tight. If we're in Iowa, it's tight. If we're here in the Carolinas and Georgia and South Carolina and increasingly in Florida, it's tight. And that's one of the reasons that when we were talking about how much volume we could recover in half 2 relative to those torrential rains that occurred in half 1 in the United States or in Texas, in particular, we had some concerns about that. It's still a concern in markets like DFW and North Texas, in particular. Because, again, that economy, we talked about the fact that's the best single-family housing market in the United States. So you can imagine the type of activity that can be there. So the supply chain, the ability to deliver, et cetera, is challenged in those marketplaces. No question, Todd.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And, Todd, I think if there was one uniform message that – as you know, our planning process has us travel around country. The one uniform message that we had, really, from almost every part of the geographies, was dealing with labor, and that impact on the supply chain.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: And just to be clear, Anne, labor at your operations or labor at your customers?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Customers.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Customers. Downstream, Todd.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thank you. First question is on aggregates pricing. You reiterated your guidance, but we are seeing some, I guess, deceleration in the reported growth in heritage aggregates pricing. Given the context of your volume outlook for 2016, I'm just wondering how maybe we should start thinking about the rate of price growth as we look out to next year.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Garik. We've actually always been pretty consistent on that, and that is, in a circumstance where you believe you have more muted growth than others, meaning really sub-5%, then pricing as a percent and volume as a percent have – end up being relatively tied to each other, particularly as you go up the ladder right now. So what I would say is, if I'm looking at pricing across our group right now, you saw the up 5%, at the same time, if I'm looking at it on a group-by-group basis, not surprisingly, we're seeing bigger price increases on a percentage basis in the Western United States, in large part because there's room for that in the West because it's been lower. But what I would suggest, Garik, is the view that we've shared really for the last couple of years on pricing has not materially changed.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thanks. I guess just shifting to cement, couple pricing questions. You indicated that fourth quarter should be likely the last quarter that you'll see some of the low-priced TXI projects come through. And as then they roll off, you should benefit from higher pricing. Just wondering if you can maybe provide some sequential guidance on cement pricing, how we should think about those low-priced projects rolling off? And then secondly, you indicated some supply that has come onto the market in Texas. You also indicated 4% expected volume growth next year -
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: – and there's an announced price increase in the market for the spring. As you look out, clearly a couple months away, from the price increase being implemented next year, can you talk about some of the puts and takes around supply-demand in Texas and your level of confidence of securing pricing next year, given some of the supply-demand balancing?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure, we'll try to do that. I mean, here's the way that I would think about it, first of all. Let's talk about some of the dynamic that simply occurs because we're not going to be in cement in California anymore. So let's start with that and talk about the picture that you saw for the quarter, because I think that's important to really understand and have context around. So 70% of the volume decline for the quarter was attributable to Riverside in California. So what you had immediately is when the deal's announced, you had certain customers who were seeing a change in that marketplace, who were seeing a non-vertically integrated player, ourselves, going away, and the downstream customers realigning themselves. So that was what we really saw in the quarter. If we back away from that, really, you're looking at cement volumes down 4%. Our quick snapshot is of the 4%, about 2% of that is cement that's no longer finding its way to oil or the oil patch or others, trying to find a home for some of that. And the other, I think, is directly to your point, Garik, and that is you do have a new importer right now in South Texas, and there has been some share that's gone there. What I think we're focused on is value right now. To your point, we're looking at a $12-a-ton price increase in April. We are the market leader in Texas, and we have a lot of conviction around that. As I look at what Texas capacity is and look at what Texas demand is, both in 2016 and 2017, I'm seeing something in 2016 that's going to be close to 2.8 million tons of deficit. I'm seeing what people are projecting to be about a 3.2 million ton deficit as we go into 2017. So, as we're sitting here with what I feel like are very attractive and efficient plants, both in North Texas and Central Texas, I mean, here's what I'll tell you. What we have done relative to the efficiencies at Midlothian and Hunter during the time that we've been there, I think, is impressive. We can run plants in Texas as efficiently as anybody. If we want to go and get share, we can go and get share. That's not how I think we're going to put value for our shareholders today, and we're resilient on making sure that we're getting the price in that marketplace. I'm confident that we can. And the fact is, at certain levels, and I think this is where we are, price is more valuable than volume. So if you come back and take a look at what our performance was in the quarter, remember what I said in my comments. Our cement results were impressive, and we believe that. And I believe we've got a very good team. I think we've got superb locations. I think we've got great operations. And I think given the dynamic in that marketplace, I feel pretty good about it, if you can't tell.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Just building on the last discussion on Texas and cement, could we talk about aggregates in Texas? What kind of volume pricing did upi see in the quarter?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, if we're just looking at – we'll talk about the West Group for a second, because what we're really seeing if we look at the West Group is we saw tonnage – 15 million tons versus 14 million in the prior year. One thing to remember is North Troy tonnage is in there for last year, so that's going to throw that off pretty markedly. Frankly, if we look at what we see in Texas for next year, I think that's probably what you're pretty interested in, too. And I got to tell you I feel pretty good about it. I mean, if we break it down and look at it this way, Keith, I mean, North Texas, I think the market there next year is better than it is this year, in large part driven by very large projects. The Horseshoe Project in downtown Dallas, as well as I-35 E and W are both going to be under way in North Texas, in the metroplex. State Highway 183 is very much under way. Even when we move farther south to Houston, part of what I look at is not just what we have awarded – and by the way, that's I-69 and Farm Market Roads 1488 and 1774, and some of the work that we have at Freeport LNG, but really what's coming – and I'm seeing good work relative to the Harris County Tollway Authority, good TxDOT work, good work also at Bush Airport. And then when we come down to South Texas, and we're looking at the large energy and infrastructure projects that really, in my view, support a good business in 2016 and beyond at Chenier at the pipe plants, Harbor Bridge, and otherwise, the volume that I think we're going to see in Texas on these long-lived projects is really attractive. The other thing that I'm moved by in Texas right now is TxDOT already has a big budget, but if you spoke to the people at TxDOT, what they would tell you is it looks good, backlogs are good, going forward with work it looks attractive. And by the way, when we start putting this Prop 7 money to it, it's going to feel like it's some degree of steroids. So, again, you're talking big numbers in a state that already has big numbers, but what it gives me a sense of, Keith, is it's likely to be healthy there for a good while going forward. Did you need more? I'm happy to talk more about Texas, I want to make sure I'm answering you.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Well, it's a lot of information, and without context it doesn't mean a lot. Basically my question was you saw cement volume down, effectively 4% that you were saying earlier in the call. I assume aggregates would go along with that. Was that the case in the -
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, that was not the case. So if I'm looking across our Southwest division, I'm seeing aggregate volumes up in almost every district that I'm seeing, and many of them at or close to double digits. And I'm seeing price up without exception in every district, just to be granular on that.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And the second quarter, we had the torrential rains there. And of course it got better here in the third. Looks like we had, I guess, a little pickup in aggregates there, not in cement. What's the deviation there?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I just think you've got some of the supply chain issues with ready mix and otherwise that we were actually talking to previously on the call with Todd. Actually I think in North Texas it was pretty good. I think the issue that we discussed is really some of the import and other issues more focused on Houston right now. And as I said, did we give up a little bit of share in that part of Texas? Absolutely we did. Do I regret it? No, I don't. Do I think price is more valuable? I do.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And, Keith, if you think about it, Keith, there is still overhang from weather in the second quarter. You'll recall we talked about the fact that the clinker barns are full, the silos are full. So you have that, coupled with some new capacity, particularly coming into that South Texas area. That, to us, is really some of the dislocation during that period.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And – thank you for that. I guess final question. It was talked about in the initial question on the call, the delta between your commentary on nonresidential and the growth – the forecast in the press release of low single digits or modest growth, whatever you want to call it.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I guess Texas trajectory, is that the difference there versus what I think many would've expected you to say about nonresidential, or were there other -
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah, I think it probably is. I think when you go back – and I think it's trajectory and multiyear nature of it. I think that's probably what people are reading or not reading into it, because if the sense is that we feel like nonres is going off a cliff in Texas, that's not what we're seeing. I think it's the bigger issue is what kind of pop are you going to see east of the Mississippi? I think there's going to be one. I think the question is we're going to quibble over how much and when, and at some point we'll all look at it in our rearview mirrors and be right.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Ward, just as a point of clarity, you framed your outlook for 2016. You mentioned that it was done in conjunction with McGraw-Hill's forecasts, and I very much interpret it to be Martin's outlook for those end markets. But obviously McGraw-Hill kind of models stuff nationally.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Is there a very specific Martin overlay so that those are very specific to your markets? And really the gist of the question is, is there potential for you to outgrow the markets, or should we very much interpret those as your volume guidance at this point in time?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Again, this is very, very preliminary guidance, Ted. So we'll obviously come back in February and give you what we feel like is a much more detailed snapshot of it. I mean, what we do as we go through a budgeting process is we're going to use basically Dodge and we're going to use PCA as markers that we'll have, and then we'll come back and say, let's talk about what form of deviation we may or may not see from that in any given market. Because if you've got a lot of bridge work in a market, that from a dollar perspective could pop a market pretty considerably. So we use those as markers and then we use what we're seeing in the field as something to really adjust and tune that a little bit with. Does that help?
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. That's very helpful. On the Texas cement topic, I know you talked about the markets running in deficit of about 3 million tons in 2016 and 2017 -
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: – based off the most current analysis. I guess, what's the clearing mechanism for the market? I mean, is this a scenario where new imports find themselves into Texas to kind of clear the market? Is it demand destruction because pricing goes up? I mean, just – I think – we've gotten a lot of question on, I think, people's concerns that there will be more imports into Texas. So it'd be helpful just to get your guys' kind of perspective on that issue, and if you think that's a likely source of incremental supply.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I guess, my sense is – obviously Argos is coming into South Texas right now with probably – let's call it a half a million tons of cement. I do think that's a tough move for a lot of people to make simply because of logistics. Clearly, that's not something that's going to have any significant impact, for example, on a Dallas-Fort Worth type market. I think you need to remember, too, that the vast majority of players who are in that market are also domestic producers. So the short answer is unless some cement comes in, you simply can't meet the market demand. That said, I think the plants that are in that state are good, efficient plants. I think in large part the need for much advanced imports in that state will not be particularly acute. I'd be surprised if we saw that. So I don't see a marked change coming in that marketplace, Ted, at least from a logistics and a practical perspective.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thanks. And then the last question's for Anne. Anne, slide 5 of your deck, you outline a $10 million headwind from net cost increases. You talked about energy being an $11 million tailwind in the quarter, I think. Can you just bridge us on the key components of that cost increase, just so we appreciate what they are?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Ted. You're looking at some increased repair and maintenance costs, some increased overtime costs of your employees as you ramp that up versus adding a lot of new heads. Those are probably the two principal drivers.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: So net think about those being about $20 million of headwind, offset by roughly $10 million of diesel benefit?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Round numbers, yeah.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. All right. Super. I'll leave it there. I know there are other people in the queue. Good luck this quarter, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ted.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: So, a quick – I guess this would be a follow-up to Ted's question. As we look into next year, can you talk about – Anne, can you talk about some cost headwinds or tailwinds that you may be facing, outside of diesel, looking into 2016? So any other raw materials or SG&A or pension or just anything that we could kind of be aware of and watch as we enter next year?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think we'll start with pension, because that one is really what's going to be – the corporate AA bond rate at the end of 2015 will set whatever that pension cost is going to be. So you can look at the sensitivity that we have disclosed for 25 basis points movements there to tell you whether or not there should be anything that happens on the pension side. I think we will see – I don't think that we'll have big general wage inflation. I do think we'll potentially see some increase in overtime. I think as we continue to invest in our rolling stock, we should see maintenance and repair stabilize. I would also expect that for some what I would call energy derivative consumables, we consume a lot of rubber, we consume a lot of lubricants and other types of energy derivative costs, explosives. I would expect that the benefit we've seen from diesel in 2015 begin to carry its way through those types of products as we move into 2016.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then switching gears to the legacy TXI cement contracts that are rolling off this year, where are we in that process of these contracts rolling off? I guess, how much more do we have as we're going here and going through the 4Q?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I mean, Ted, they'll be substantially gone by the end of the year. I mean – Ted, I'm sorry, Trey. They'll be substantially gone by year-end.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And it was – as far as kind of how they rolled off, was 3Q a big chunk of it and then less in 4Q, or how do we measure that?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yes. The bigger chunk was in Q3.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then my last question is, I just want to make sure I understand some of the discussion around maintenance expense on the cement side.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Am I accurate in taking that you guys have lowered your maintenance expense a little bit for the – I guess, taking into account 3Q and then 4Q? Because I think the guidance was $6 million in 3Q, $14 million in 4Q, and I think you did just under that and expect that to double. So maybe it's a few million less in the 4Q than you originally expected. Is that accurate?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. That's correct.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That is accurate. Yes.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll jump back in queue. I know there's more. Thanks.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks a lot, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi. And I hope not to hammer on the same point too much, but I guess I'm trying to really understand what changed from the second quarter to the third quarter. The first half, you had lots of rain that was suppressing volumes. And you have a lot less rain in the third quarter, but volume growth slowed, price growth slowed. From what I've heard so far, it sounds like energy volumes in Texas is a chunk of that, or what am I missing here?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think in large part, what – I'm not sure you're missing anything per se, Craig. I think a lot of it goes back to how much can the market absorb right now, given logistics and other downstream constraints that I think the market is just generally faced with as we speak. And I think a lot of the makeup – if you can give me a good sense of how long weather will at least be warm and dry into Q4, honestly, I think that's your big swing factor. So what I'm more focused on is when I come back and take a look at pricing for the quarter, I'm not disappointed on pricing in the quarter. And again, I think pricing next year is going to be a very good story. And if we can run effectively through Thanksgiving, you can have a Q4 that could make up some of that volume. That's really your swing factor, Craig. I don't think we ever anticipated Q3 was going to be a period of time where you'd see a lot of makeup on that.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And when you're looking at nonresidential, your forecast of a slight or modest growth in 2016, is that based more on your bottoms-up process or the external data that you're using?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, it's pretty broadly macro with a dash of what we're seeing, again, very preliminarily relative to some of the local markets. I mean, obviously, we're going to come back when we get in Q1 and we roll up the full year and give you a sense of how we feel like all of that's going to roll up. But the fact is, if you look at the way that we've done it over the years, I think what you're going to find, Craig, is we tend to be relatively conservative in the way that we roll that up. And I think that's one of the reasons that we're good on costs as well. I think good, slow, steady growth helps us relative to how we spend our dollars, how we hire people, and how we plan. So I think if there's a bias there built in, in Martin Marietta, it's one toward conservatism.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Well, I guess the disconnect is we kind of – we entered the year and – expecting to be on the cusp of an upturn in the construction cycle, and I think people are surprised to see volume growth expectations tapering down at this point.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, yeah, I think the important thing to remember is we're talking about volume growth expectations, and I think the other thing to keep in mind is what we're doing with those volume growth expectations is putting some very serious money on the bottom line. So if you're looking at the performance of this business and what our people do, if there's anything in the performance of the business that's disappointing to people, I'm at a loss on what that can be. We can control a lot of things at Raleigh, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, other places. Volume isn't necessarily one of them, but when it comes our way, we can make money with it. And that's very much what we're doing. And, again, we're talking about growth. We're only quibbling over what the amount of growth is going to look like. And, again, if we're tending toward conservatism and we have downstream markets that are tough to take increased volume simply because you've got trucking and other issues that are under some degree of duress, I'm not sure that that's a fair view of a problem with the market, because we don't see that right now.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And could there be other issues in the fourth quarter related to weather from South Carolina or any -
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, look, weather has been a challenge. I mean very candidly, we've got a quarry north of Columbia, South Carolina, that has 4 billion gallons in it. I mean, the Broad River came out of its banks and filled it up. And we'll pump it out, and we'll put it right back in the Broad River. The quarry happens to be a rail-connected quarry. And as you'll recall, Craig, we've got the largest rail-connected quarry system in the United States in the Aggregates business. So we can go into the marketplaces that can now not be served by north Columbia by rail from other quarries, and we can equally come into markets by boat. So from a market service perspective, I don't think we're going to be that affected by it. From an efficiency perspective, can we be affected by it? Yeah. And I guess the other thing that I would say is insurance in circumstances like that is pretty difficult to have. So you, in large part, tend to be relatively self-insured. And so what I would tell you is there's going to be some capital that's going to be utilized in that as we go forward. And the other thing, just in fairness, we did experience over the weekend pretty considerable rain events in Central and South Texas as well. And at our Webberville facility outside of Austin, we got a lot more water there than we typically would. And at Garwood Sand & Gravel which is typically a wet operation, we've had more water there than usual. Again, do I view these as material? No, I don't. Are they issues that can affect pure efficiencies in some markets? Sure. But, as we said in the commentary, relative to Q4, weather is the single most important variable on the way that quarter's going to play out.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: And you'll have the water back in the river by the end of the fourth quarter?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, we will not. I mean, when you've got a quarry that's got several billion gallons – and that's what it has, several billion gallons of water in it – you can expect that to take the better part of half a year as opposed to a matter of weeks or months.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks a lot, guys.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, thanks for sneaking me in again here at the very end. I just wanted to get some color on the net proceeds. Can you remind us what were the net proceeds of the sale of Oro Grande?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we sold OG for $420 million. We've got basically the $25 million that we referenced relative to some environmental indemnities and some inventory write-downs. So there's your quick math, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All rights, so that's it, there wasn't anything else. Okay. And you bought back $158 million of stock in the quarter, and I think you mentioned using the net proceeds from the sale to repurchase stock. This sale didn't occur until the end of the quarter, so how should we think about that net roughly – just call it rough numbers, $400 million? Is that still incremental, or was that $158 million kind of – should we take that out as we look forward, just as purely as the net as it relates to the proceeds from the sale of Oro Grande?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Trey, as we indicated, in anticipation of the sale, we went ahead and accelerated the purchase against that $420 million.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: So just net it out, Trey.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So you should net it out, and it will have the expectations that we should complete the balance of that.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot for clearing that up.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call. We're enthusiastic about the opportunities to generate strong cash flow and return value to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase program that we were just discussing. We look forward to talking with you more about our fourth quarter and full-year results with you in February. Thanks for your time today and your continued support of our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As announced in this morning's release, our second quarter results reflect continued solid performance and disciplined execution against stated objectives, controlling those things that we can and dealing effectively with those circumstances over which we have no control, such as extraordinary weather conditions. I'll touch upon that later, but let me first initially discuss our results. Strong pricing, cost reductions in our heritage business, coupled with continued synergy realization and profit contributions from the acquired businesses, drove record net sales and record earnings from operations as well as a 100-basis point expansion in our consolidated gross margin. In fact, significantly improved gross margin in all heritage aggregates reportable segments led to incremental gross margin contributions well above our stated objectives. Remarkably, these results were achieved despite those things we cannot control, principally historic levels of rainfall throughout the United States and particularly in Texas. In short, we believe these weather patterns reduced second quarter consolidated gross profit by nearly $40 million. We feel it's important that we provide some perspective on these weather challenges, not in an effort to simply state the obvious, that indeed our second quarter results could have been stronger, but rather, so you can more fully evaluate our results and get a clear picture of our earnings potential. That said, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has tracked participation levels for 121 years. For that period, the second quarter of 2015 was the second wettest for the entire United States. Focusing solely on the state of Texas, NOAA reported the second quarter as well as the first six months of the year were the wettest ever recorded. Contextually, Dallas, Houston and Austin experienced rainfall in May alone of 17, 14 and 17.5 inches respectively. To put this amount of monthly rainfall in perspective, The Washington Post reported that the water that flowed into Texas reservoirs alone, a tremendous 8 million acre-feet, would be enough to meet New York City's water needs for seven years. Beyond Texas and the impact on the Southwest in cement divisions, five additional key states had their top 10 wettest second quarters ever recorded, impacting both sales and productivity in our Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Mideast divisions. We estimate nearly 3 million tons of aggregates, with 1.8 million tons in Texas alone, 450,000 cubic yards of ready-mix concrete and 215,000 tons of cement shipments were deferred to later in the year and into 2016 as a result of weather. Notwithstanding the significant weather impact during the first half of 2015, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong, driven by steady ongoing economic recovery and we fully expect to capture delayed business in the last half of the year and into 2016, assuming more normal weather patterns. This morning's release also contained important strategic and shareholder value-enhancing developments related to our TXI acquisition. First, we were pleased to once again raise our annual synergy guidance to $120 million by the end of 2016, more than 70% above our initial estimate at the acquisition date a little over a year ago. Second, we signed the definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which we expect to close later this quarter. We intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under a program initiated during the second quarter. Before we discuss second quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. To provide transparency into our second quarter results, I'll discuss the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and two other small aggregates product line transactions completed during the year's first quarter. While it's currently important to understand the results of heritage versus acquired operations, this comparison is becoming increasingly less meaningful as we successfully complete the integration of TXI operations into our heritage business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe doing so provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance. Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business. Slide three provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. When evaluating aggregates product line volume variances, it's important to note that the prior-year second quarter includes shipments from three facilities in the West Group, a quarry in Oklahoma and two related sales distribution yards that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these three locations should be excluded from the prior-year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were down 3%, while shipments for the heritage aggregates business increased slightly. Both of these metrics were negatively impacted by excessive rainfall during the second quarter, meaningfully impacting the West Group and also the Mid-America Group. Slide four presents gross margin by product line for acquired operations. In addition to delayed shipments, profitability for these product lines was also negatively affected by weather, which resulted in lower production and efficiency levels. Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market accounted for approximately 43% of total shipments and declined 3.6% compared with the prior-year quarter. This decline is attributable to the impact of wet weather and to a lesser degree, uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Trust Fund. We continue to see state-level funding initiatives come to fruition in numerous states, a sign of pent-up demand. Texas leads the nation in highway contract awards and expects to let nearly $7.5 billion in fiscal 2015. In November, Texas voters will decide on Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an incremental $2.5 billion of revenue from the sales and use tax annually for the State Highway Fund beginning September 1, 2017. Given our significant existing backlog, we anticipate Texas infrastructure shipments to report growth over the next several years. Major project activity is also accelerating in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with all three states along with Texas being actively engaged in TIFIA-funded projects. Each of these states continues to be among the top states in the country for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Further, we believe the recently passed funding initiatives in Georgia and Iowa will have a meaningful long-term impact on infrastructure activity in both states. Recently, both houses of Congress passed, and the President signed, a continuing resolution, extending the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, through October 29, 2015. During this period of extended funding, we expect Congress to work toward passage of a new multi-year bill. There's broad bipartisan support and recognition of the importance of long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure. These include discussions between Congress and the White House, evaluating whether a reduced income tax rate or other incentive for multinational companies to repatriate earnings, could provide a source of funding for a long-term federal highway bill. We believe the Senate's proposed six-year highway bill will likely provide the framework for broader congressional debate following the August recess. We and others have long believed that the passage of a long-term infrastructure program for our nation is a top priority. It's gratifying to see the Congress and the President seem to be moving along a path that will provide our citizens with legislation that will accomplish a goal that most Americans consider to be critical to our quality of life. The non-residential end use market is comprised of two components, light and heavy. The light non-residential component is primarily office and retail, and demand in this area is generally tied more directly to employment growth and residential demand. We expect light non-residential-related volumes to continue to increase, driven by improved economic fundamentals, which is coinciding with some of the reemergence of speculative construction activity. The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy. The heavy non-residential end use market represented 22% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and declined 11%. However, we believe this decline is driven in part by weather and expect to recoup the delayed volumes within 12 months. As expected, shale energy-related volumes have declined versus the prior year quarter, but are believed to be stabilizing. We continue to expect energy-related construction activity to remain strong, notably along the Gulf Coast. As one example, the Port of Corpus Christi continues to prepare for long-term energy activity. Of note, a port official indicated the decline in oil prices has not reduced either the output of oil in Texas or the volumes transported via the port. Overall, United States crude oil production is projected to reach 9.5 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of 800,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels. In summary, we believe underlying non-residential demand continues to strengthen, as starts for the nation are up 12% over the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Texas continues to lead the nation with growth of $6.5 billion or 19% for the same period. Additionally, non-building construction activity, most notably related to liquefied natural gas products, is up over $30 billion nationally, including more than $18 billion in Texas. The residential end use market represented 16% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior-year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be relatively consistent with the trend in housing starts. Texas, Florida and Georgia lead the nation in single-family unit starts, each with nearly double-digit growth for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the second quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our second quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were down slightly, primarily related to excessive rainfall in Colorado and Iowa. Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 7.6% over the prior-year quarter, led by the West Group. We view this level of continued strength in aggregates product line pricing as an indication of underlying product demand and increased contractor confidence. Heritage aggregates product line total production costs were negatively affected by weather-related inefficiencies. The resulting decrease in operating leverage led to a 3% increase in cost per ton shipped. We continue to benefit from decline in diesel prices and on average paid $2.12 per gallon compared with $3.13 in the prior-year quarter, resulting in a $9 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the heritage business. The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3.5 million. Notably, the heritage ready mixed concrete product line reported a 10% increase in average selling price. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $33 million and was 26% of net sales, an improvement of 530 basis points over the prior-year quarter. All reportable segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by an increase of 810 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our heritage aggregates business generated an incremental gross margin of 214%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. We expect further economic recovery in the Southeastern United States to provide continued margin expansion. The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $60.5 million and a gross margin of 35.1%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $18.8 million. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production and the timing of typical maintenance costs. Slides four and five provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the second quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of $36 million on external shipments of 2.8 million tons. Average selling price was $13.52 per ton, reflecting a product mix skewed by standing gravel as well as rail yard shipments. The acquired ready-mix concrete business shipped 1.1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.80. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected the business and reduced the profitability by an estimated $9 million. The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. Second quarter operating results were also negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments through the balance of the year and into 2016. For the second quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $98.86 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $100 million. The business achieved a gross margin of over 30% after incurring almost $6 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We announced price increases effective April 1. However, there is a lag time before we realize the full benefit. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses were 6.7% of net sales, an increase of 60 basis points. This reflects the impact of weather-driven lower net sales and higher pension expense. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate for the next few quarters. As detailed on slide six, our consolidated earnings from operations for the second quarter of $137 million improved more than $40 million from the prior-year earnings of $96 million. Our employees continued to work diligently on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. In that regard, as previously noted, we now expect annual synergies to reach $120 million by the end of next year. Consistent with our integration plan, we completed the remaining systems integration for the cement and ready mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, and I do want to thank our employees for their commitment to and patience with that process. For the first half of the year, we generated $127 million of operating cash flow compared with $70 million for 2014, efficiently converting increased earnings into cash. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project we believe will be substantially complete by year-end. Further, during the first half of the year, we returned $154 million to our shareholders, both through the repurchase of 670,000 shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015 was 2.4 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range. In this morning's press release, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which is consistent with our strategic observations and timeframe when we acquired TXI. Our Oro Grande cement plant in Southern California is a state-of-the-art facility operated by a talented and committed workforce. However, the plant and its two related distribution terminals are neither proximate to other Martin Marietta core assets, nor complemented by downstream operations in California's traditionally vertically-integrated marketplace. Thus, after careful consideration and evaluation, we determined the best avenue to maximize shareholder value is to sell these operations. The sales price is $420 million, and as previously mentioned, we intend to use the proceeds to repurchase additional shares of our common stock. Looking ahead to our full-year guidance, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue, and importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate, fueling an emerging construction recovery. During the second half of the year, we anticipate capturing a significant amount of weather-delayed shipments from the first half of the year. However, market capacity constraints will shift some of the delayed project activity into 2016. Accordingly, we modified our guidance to reflect this shift as well as the pending sale of the California cement operations. Currently, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 7% to 10% over 2014, with 3% to 5% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $810 million to $850 million, with the change from prior quarter's guidance directly related to weather-deferred profitability and the planned California divestiture. To conclude, we continue to be very excited about the future of Martin Marietta, which by virtually any measure, reflects a very positive growth trajectory. We believe the economy is in a construction-centric phase in both the residential and non-residential sectors, and we also feel the prospects for a multiyear transportation bill is greater this year than it has been for nearly a decade. Importantly, our company is well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities we see. From a geographical and operational approach, we're poised to deliver high-quality products, which in turn, translates into increased revenues, profits and value for Martin Marietta and our investors. All the while, we remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, which together should lead to increased shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. The first question is focused on the fundamentals. How much of the incremental margin performance in the quarter was driven by lower costs, in other words, the $9 million that you outlined earlier, versus pricing or any other factor? And along the pricing line, what we're trying to get a better sense is, are there certain markets that are seeing greater pricing leverage? And essentially, are you seeing the benefit yet from a geographic mix or are you just mainly seeing improvement purely from price increases? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Kathryn, thank you for your questions. What I would say is several things are really hitting that. Number one, pricing is falling right to the bottom line in many respects. So let's start with that notion. The other piece that I think is important is we are talking about an emerging recovery in the Southeast right now. And we've discussed in the past when places like Georgia saw 70% of their volume decline and North Carolina saw 50% of its volume decline, volume coming back in those markets is very, very powerful. When we're looking at job rate recovery and growth right now and we're seeing North Carolina and Georgia in the top five and top seven, that will drive volumes in those states. You have to remember, there was a day and an hour that we made $100 million in the Southeastern United States. And when we were making $100 million in the Southeastern United States, we didn't have the type of presence or geographical location that we do today. So Kathryn, to your point, pricing is helping. We're clearly seeing very good cost control in the heritage business. And yes, we are getting a mix help from the Southeast coming back. To the other part of your question relative to what we're seeing relative to price increases, it's entirely consistent with what we've been discussing for the last several quarters. We said that you should expect the west to outpace the east for a while. That continues to be what we're seeing. Texas, we continue to see very nice double-digit price increases. That said, we're seeing double-digit price increases in Indiana. We're seeing double-digit price increases in Ohio. We're seeing double-digit price increases in portions of the Southeast as well. So we've got a good spread of price increases throughout our entire operation. That's something that, again, with volumes recovering and contractor confidence, we anticipated that we would see.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Thank you. My second question relates to your California asset divestiture. And just a couple of housekeeping questions related to those. What was the EBITDA, trailing 12-month EBITDA contribution from California? I know this historically had been a pretty big laggard, but is it – what is EBITDA for trailing 12 months? How much G&A is associated with these assets? And apart from some tax treatment of the transaction? Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Kathryn, I'll give it to you this way. If we look at the six months that we owned the California cement operations last year, we had about a $5 million EBITDA on that. Obviously, that tells you the EBITDA contribution that you're looking at in the second half of the year isn't something that I want you to spend a lot of time adjusting your model for. So I think that would be entirely fair. I think with respect to the tax treatment, on the federal side, we'll be able to utilize the NOLs that we have to basically take care of any federal tax there. We anticipate there might be $10 million to $11 million worth of state tax that may be captured out of that $420 million number. So again, what we feel like is, we have a very tax-efficient transaction under the structure that we put forward.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: And G&A, how much should we expect that will go away?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That again, Kathryn, very little G&A associated with that facility, so that I would tell you from an EBITDA and G&A perspective, it's not going to be enough to move any needle.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi, Ward and Anne. It's actually P. T. Luther standing in for Timna today.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, P. T.
P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi there. I was wondering if you could just give a better sense of the demand traction that you're seeing the Southeast? Is it continued steady improvement or would you say the cadence or the trajectory has changed of late?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a very good, steady improvement. I mean here's the way that I would think of it. If you look at Florida, from where I'm sitting, it's very positive. We're seeing all segments up. It's number three in job growth, which was really fueling construction. It's got a very strong DOT program, it's near-record levels. The I-4 Ultimate job is very much underway. And again, only 25% of the funds in Florida come from the federal government, so they've got a good, strong program there. They are number one in res right now and number three in non-res, so all of that feels very good for Florida and our import business there. Georgia, we believe, is really starting to hit its stride. I mean, we're looking at Georgia at number five in job growth, number three in res, number 10 in non-res, effectively a doubling of DOT construction in that state that candidly, won't even really start to impact it until 2016, but we are seeing the benefits of the TSLOS (29:11) program in South Georgia as well, which I think is a good precursor on what we'll see in the Northern parts of the state. And what I would say on North Carolina, and I think this is disproportionately important, is now we're seeing North Carolina really as an up-and-comer. I mean think of it in these terms: number seven in employment, get this though, number 51 in housing, but number 10 in single family housing. We're starting to see more single family housing and more subdivision work in North Carolina. And number 18 in non-residential. And then if I'm looking at DOT, just over a trailing 12-month period, awards are up 29%. But here's something you can take away as well: we have a Republican governor, House and Senate, and one of the biggest single fights that we have in North Carolina right now is how much more we're going to spend as a state on transportation. So to your point, looking at those Southeastern states and those three tend to be disproportionately important to us, that really is a strong driver for us. Does that answer your question?
P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yeah. That's helpful, thanks. And then also if I could dig a bit more into demand on the energy-related side. We've got oil at sub-$50. I know you made some positive comments on your initial commentary, but just wondering if you could talk about a little bit more what you're seeing there in terms of demand related to shale, if that's stabilized, if you see any LNG projects at risk, things of that sort.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think it has either stabilized or it's stabilizing. When we spoke at the end of Q1, we said we thought it would look a lot like it looked in 2012, which was about a 7 million ton level as opposed to about – I mean a 6 million ton level as opposed to 7.5 million last year. I think you've got a couple things. One, it has continued to slow. Weather has clearly affected it. If I had to sit here today and give you a sense of it, I think it will probably be somewhere between 4.5 million tons and 5 million tons of product going directly to the shale plays. So I think that's probably real. As we come back and answer the second half of your question relative to the large projects going on in South Texas, I guess I would say several things in that regard. Number one, I think the LNG projects are clearly starting up. Freeport is now shipping. The Schneer project will be next. If we're looking at what we think those volumes may look like over a multi-year period, I mean I could see over 1 million tons going to that in the back half of this year. And just looking at what we see right now, I can see at least 0.5 million or more than 0.5 million per year really through 2019. So again, if we're looking at what's going on there for a multi-year period, it looks pretty attractive. I mean if we're looking at non-building just – period across the United States, it's up 30%, but it's overwhelmingly still driven by what we're seeing in Texas. So Texas is up $18.5 billion, and that's over half of the national increase. So we see something in that portion of a non-res that continues to be healthy and we think what we're seeing also in office and retail, up 22% for the quarter, doing exactly what we thought. We believe that the portions of non-res that were going to be strong this year would overpower the weakness in shale. And we think that – those two things coming together, together with simply lower energy pricing, is actually a pretty healthy mix for us right now.
P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. And the last question, and then I'll hand it over. Diesel prices, I think you've assumed a rather high price relative to where spots have been of late. So I'm wondering if you can give us any more color on the diesel price that's assumed in the guidance for the back half.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: If we're looking – I can give you a sense of where we are now, and then really what we've said is we thought we would have full-year savings of a little bit over $39 million. So if we look at where we are now, obviously, we had $9 million worth of savings in heritage in Q2, just a little bit over $11 million for the full business. We had about $10 million in Q1, so again, if you want to just carry that out at a fairly normal cadence and come up with about $39.2 million savings for the full year, you wouldn't be a mile off.
P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks again, Ward.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, P. T. Take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thank you. Just on the synergy update for the TXI acquisition, you bumped up your target again here today. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what bucket these additional synergies are coming from? And how much more potential upside is there given that you've taken up your synergy targets several times already?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Garik, if we go back and look at what the synergies looked like at the beginning, it was $70 million. We've had about $34 million would come from SG&A and about $36 million operationally. You're right, we did take it up earlier in the year and when we did that, the SG&A savings that we were seeing at that point had gone up to about $41 million, and we think that's the show on that. The operational savings had gone up to around $86 million, and again, these are operational issues. It's what we're seeing combining Chico and Bridgeport, what we're seeing pulling together their former Mill Creek and our former Mill Creek. So the operational synergies that we saw when we came back in January were about $86 million. Now going forward we think again the SG&A is staying static at about $42 million. We're seeing operational synergies really filling the balance of that at about $82 million, and then tallying it all up to about around that $120 million number.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thanks. Switching now to cement, you saw good sequential improvements in that pricing. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color about potential price increases later on in this fall. And also as a follow up, would there be any impact to the divestiture on reported pricing, meaning is there any mix implications from exiting California as it relates to the consolidated price?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Garik, here's what I would say. If we're looking at pricing for the year, Q2 pricing, it was up 17% in Texas. It was also up 17% in California. Now, there is a bogey between those two numbers. So if you're looking at Texas pricing for us at $102.85 and California pricing at $89.45, I mean that pretty much gives you the mix on how that's going to look. So, yeah, it certainly would make ASP on cement better without the California numbers in there. With respect to pricing, I guess I've got a couple of observations. Weather slowed everything down mightily in Texas. And you know that and I do, too. If we're looking at volumes, North Texas volumes for the quarter were down for us 22%. South Texas, they were down 18%. I think in that type of environment, will we be looking for some price increases later in the year? We'll certainly be looking for it. I think as a practical matter, the fact that price increases have done so far what they've done in that type of a weather-challenged volume environment is actually a very good story. We're more focused right now on what we're going to be doing with pricing as we come out early in 2016 as opposed to the latter part of 2015.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Makes sense. The last question is on a point of clarification in the press release. I believe you indicated additional cement maintenance expected in the fourth quarter. You had some here in the second quarter. I was just wondering maybe if you can provide an annual expected maintenance expense. Or I guess in other words, how much are you expecting the fourth quarter to incur?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, just relative to the kilns themselves? I missed the first part of your question. Is that where you're going here?
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah, I read in the press release you are anticipating additional maintenance in the fourth quarter in cement. So I was just wondering if you could quantify that.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: If we look at what the 2015 numbers look like, Q1 was $5.4 million, Q2 $5.9 million. We're looking at a Q3 forecast of $6.1 million and we're looking at a Q4 forecast of $14.1 million, which brings you to an all-in kiln forecast of $31.5 million.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Super helpful. Thanks.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And that's for the total cement business, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's got everything rolled in, so that's Texas and California for the purposes, just for clarity.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And hopefully this will be the last question on California. The revenues at the sold California cement operation were, annualized?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I didn't understand your question.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: What were the annual revenues of your California cement operation?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Craig, we have (38:30) disclosed what those annual revenues were. We'll obviously come back and talk more about the transaction once we're done. But I thinking giving a sense of really, we've got about, call it, an average 1.5 million tons of capacity there. I think with what we've given on the capacity numbers and the EBITDA numbers, until the transaction is done, I think that's probably as much detail as I'd feel comfortable offering on that.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you've been performing at about 80% of capacity there?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: In California, it's been under capacity for quite a while and we've certainly discussed that. If we were looking in Texas, it's going to be somewhere in the mid-80%s, in California it would have been considerably under that, yes.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. In the press release, you noted $18 million of added pension expense from a lower discount rate assumption. Is that all in the second quarter? Or how is that...
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Craig, this is Anne. That will be throughout the course of the year and about 60% of that flows through production overhead. The balance flows through SG&A because it follows on a per capita basis.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And so about the run rate, I assume you're going to run that throughout the year, so the run rate I assume is comparable to what we're looking at in the second quarter?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you, Ward and Anne. You guys purchased $100 million of stock in the quarter, expect to buy back more with the Oro Grande sale. And I think you mentioned it was $420 million. Are you expecting to use all $420 million on the buyback? Or is that just a general number? And can you give us any color at all on potential timing just roughly?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what, our good friends from the state of California, as I said, will take a little bit of that. So we'll have to assume some of that $420 million comes off, but that's only going to be about $10 million or $11 million. The short answer is, we do intend to use all of that to repurchase the stock. And the exact way that we'll do that, we're going to play that carefully as we go through the balance of the year. But we certainly intend to utilize that during the year to buy back the stock, yes.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, through the year. Great. And then along the same lines but from a M&A standpoint, you guys are obviously very committed to buying back stock. But how are you thinking about potential M&A with your current buyback goals and with some potential opportunity possibly coming available from some pending consolidation out there in the market?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Trey. I hear you and I agree with you. We are excited about continuing to grow our business. We're looking at a number of different transactions right now. Most of them tend to be, in my view, very attractive bolt-on transactions that we're looking at in existing markets. The nice thing is, with our balance sheet in the shape that it's in, we can do multiple things. We can continue to return money to shareholders. And the fact that we've returned $154 million to the shareholders in the first half of the year is something what we're proud of. But I can tell you too at the end of the year, I'd be surprised if we don't have some very attractive bolt-on acquisitions. Remember for us, now Trey, the turn of leverage is $850 million. Before we did this transaction with TXI, the largest deal we had ever done was Redland and that was $270 million. So, our ability to fund for a balance sheet cash flow or otherwise, very attractive, bolt-on transactions is great, and our interest is great as well.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right, that's real helpful, Ward. Thank you. And then, Anne, this one might before you. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe your guidance, last assumed diesel prices were around $3.39 a gallon. Can you give us an update? What your average diesel price was in the quarter? And then any update on what's baked into that guidance, the updated guidance that you guys gave us on EBITDA for the full year?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. The average diesel price was $2.12, as I think Ward had indicated in the opening comments. As we indicated, we will have about $39 million to $40 million of savings that we've got built into the guidance for the year. And we've recognized about $20 million of that through the first six months.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot. I guess I missed that part of the comments. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Trey, just to add a little bit more color, to give you a sense of – we've burned about 11.2 million gallons in Q2, and you can imagine, Q3 is usually our heaviest usage quarter, so if that helps.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Yes, it does. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Jerry.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ward, can you talk about, as we enter year end, any other significant market repricing opportunities that you see heading into next year? Obviously, we've got a big structural improvement in a big chunk of the West Group this year. Can you, in rough terms, talk about any opportunities that are high on your radar screen heading into January 1 announced price increases?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what? Absolutely. Number one, we'll come out with January 1 price increases in all of our geographies. What I'll tell you too is either between mid-year price increases, we're simply upping what we're doing on bidded work, we're seeing price increases in all of our districts and divisions night now. Now, it may be captured or put out in different nomenclature and some places you will actually see mid-year price increases. For example, we have seen that very specifically in portions of the Southeast. We've seen that very, very specifically in portions of the Southwest, but other places we're seeing it on a job-by-job, bid-by-bid basis, again preparing not just for the second half of the year, but preparing as we go into next year. Again, I have seen at least some of the Dodge data that's come out over the last few days. And as I look at that, this gives me a sense again that we'll be looking at a pretty high degree of contractor confidence going into next year. Again, this is not our guidance. I'm just giving you what Dodge is saying. But Dodge is seeing total construction up in 2016, 12%. It's seeing non-res up 11%. It's seeing residential up 20%. And you've often heard what I've said in the past and that is, at a certain point, as volume continues to grow more than that 5% basis, you should be able to see your percentage pricing and your percentage volume growth linked up and moving in some degree at tandem together with the pricing having a little bit of a lag. So I've tried to answer your question relatively to what we're seeing on a division-by-division basis, how we're going about it and also at least what people who do forecasting for living, like FW Dodge, are saying about next year and how that's going to relate to price, and I hope that helped.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. I appreciate the color. And as you think about the price increases mid-year, I know you went after a more significant beginning of the year price increase this year. Can you just give us an update on what kind of mid-year price increase cadence we should be thinking about?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know it's going to vary pretty considerably. There are some products – you know sand is short, for example, in the DFW marketplace right now. There are a number of sand operations along the Red River that were so flooded out that operators are truly not going be in a position, in some instances as I understand it, to open them until the fall this year. So sand prices in DFW may be up $2 a ton. Again, we're looking to take ready-mix up $8 a yard in DFW on or around September 1. So I mean those are pretty heavy movements. At the same time, there are parts of Southeast where we're going in and seeing some customers going up as much $1 a ton. And part of what I think is moving to me as I'm seeing the way mid-year forward thinking about next year will look like, we're getting out as much of that nomenclature around cents and we're talking more about dollars. And I think that's an important transition in the conversation.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And lastly, on the last count, I think there were a dozen or so states that have fairly recently increased highway spending in absence of better federal spending. Can you talk about, are there any states based on your local folks where you think the increase in state funding is close to moving forward? I know you have a good handle of the political landscape there.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, but I mean here's what we've seen and here's what we'll see. Iowa put their gas tax up $0.10 March 1. That's going put another $215 million annually in what they're doing. That's about a 30% increase. Again, Georgia's coming back, adding almost $1 billion to their DOT budget. That's almost a doubling of it. To give you a sense of it, our quick math says $900 million of new spending consumes probably around 7 million tons of crushed stone. We've talked about how powerful incremental stone is with a market like that. Florida's got just shy of a record DOT budget. Again, we talked about the fact that North Carolina right now, with a Republican legislature and governor, is going through the process, but our senate who would like to stop seeing funds diverted from a highway trust fund to the general fund, put several hundred million dollars a year more to North Carolina highways. We're certainly a fan of that. Our governor would like to come back and borrow money at historically low rates with a couple different bond issues that are there on the ballot for later this fall. We'll see how all of that goes but, again, Iowa's a Republican state, Nebraska's a Republican state, North Carolina's a Republican state and these are all states, as is Texas, with their Prop 7, looking to put more money into highways right now separate and distinct from what may happen on the federal side. One thing that I think we need to remember too, Jerry, is that if we get a highway bill, part of what's going to happen is we're going to see parts of the United States and, in my view, more rural areas, have more highway money to spend. And I think that's going to be important, one, for economic development. And number, two some of the rural operations we have can be very profitable operations. And those are the operations throughout this downturn that have suffered disproportionately. So I think the fact that DOT initiatives are really taking over at the state level, and they're doing a lot of it for themselves, and we've got this great prospect, I believe, of getting a highway bill this year, that's the one-two punch that could be notable.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey. So I apologize if I missed this earlier, but can you, I know overall heritage volumes are up just about 1%. Can you say what Texas did in isolation?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Texas, we talked about what Texas was when we took out North Troy.
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, we really look at the West Group, Ted. We've not really given any specific guidance on individuals, other than about 1.8 million tons of shipments were deferred out of the total 3 million tons in the state of Texas alone. But if you look at reported volumes in the West Group, take out the divested assets that we divested of last year, but are still included in the numbers and look at the impact of the rain, or the weather-deferred shipments in the West Group, adjusting for all those items, our volumes would have been up about 11%, those two, those together add up to about 3.1 million tons.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. That's super helpful. And so, I think everybody on the call appreciates all the things going in Texas's favor, whether it's res or non-res and the public side. I guess what I'm just curious is, how do you see kind of momentum building in the back half and then when we hit 2016 in the state of Texas specifically? And then what would be the implications on pricing? What kind of framework would you encourage people to embrace?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Say it again, I guess what I would say, is we start with our largest end use there, which is going to be infrastructure and we began with $7.5 billion worth of lettings. And that's on the heels of two previous record budgets. It goes back to my commentary when I said I can see volumes being very aggressive in Texas, not just for this year and next, but really for years out. And then when we're coming back and looking at the sheer level of non-res activity that continues to be there and the emerging presence now that we're seeing in office and retail in that state and the continued mature housing market that's there. And what I mean by that is we're seeing new subdivisions built. So Ted, that's simply going to be a more aggregate-intensive undertaking relative to residential than multi-family or otherwise. So, what I would say is, our outlook for volumes in Texas continues to be quite good and we've been consistent that you should expect pricing in the West to generate outpaced pricing in the East at least on a percentage basis. And I don't see anything right now that sways me from that view.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And on the $7.5 billion of lettings, can you put that in context? What was lettings in calendar 2014, so are there fiscal 2014 just so we can dimensionalize what that change is?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, if you go back and look at it, remember, they're on a fiscal year that ends in August. And what Texas has done over the last several years is they come out with a much bigger budget than they're typically able to spend. So they came out this year looking at something that started in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, came back and said they're going to be at about $7.5 billion. That's reasonably consistent with where they were last year as well. So now, if you're taking those two, building on that, what we believe is going to be past Prop 7, that's going to come back and put another $2.5 billion, we think we're going to see a nice run rate probably in that zone, maybe as low as the $5 billions, maybe as high as the $8 billion or $9 billion over a period of time.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. That's helpful. The second thing I just wanted to ask you was on the guidance side. So if you take EBITDA guidance down $25 million, it sounds like cement's about $10 million, you could back into aggregates being about $25 million. Could you walk through all of the components, the headwinds and the tailwinds just so we understand exactly? It sounded like the embedded diesel benefits were upsides versus what was embedded in the prior guidance, but maybe I misunderstood that. I just wanted to make sure we understand.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think the big issue, Ted, is that you've got I think it was around 13 million tons (sic) [$13 million] (54:45) of profit that was deferred from Q1...
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: $13 million.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, and then you've got about $40 million in Q2. And the fact as you take that, let's call it, $53 million and come back to the view (54:55), it's going to be impossible to make all of that up. And I think one of the issues that we've been faced with, but I think the industry has been faced with in Texas, if it rains for a while, it impacts your sales. If it rains for a long while, it impacts your sales and it impacts your production. And I think several things are happening. One, I think the logistics and supply chain is going to be really stretched in Texas for the rest of the year. And by that I mean, can people find enough trucking to get aggregates to locations? I think the short answer is going to be they can't. I think the other issue we talked a little bit about sand plants that continue to be flooded right now. The ability to come and really push product out of those sites the way that we would wish is going to be challenged as well. And I think the last piece of it is, can people even keep up with some of the clean stone requirements going forward? Now, some of the good news for us is a lot of the work that we see both in North Texas and South Texas can be relatively new work. So think about it in these terms, I-35 in North Texas and the Grand Parkway in South Texas, we're going to see more base going on those jobs for a while so that the clean stone needs won't be as acute, but they're still going to be pretty serious, particularly as we roll into next year. It's simply the inability of the industry to meet what I think the demand could be. The other issue is this, Ted, what's weather going to look like in Q4? If we have a good long fall, frankly like we did last year, then we can probably cover a lot of that ground, but we're counting on a more normal Q4 this year. So that's really what takes down the EBITDA guidance.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. So I just want to be sure I understand this. There's $53 million of profit pushed from one half into two half and beyond. Do you think you capture half of that, which is the net $25 million and then another $10 million on cement?
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's not...
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's probably close enough (56:55).
Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. That's a nice synopsis, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Are there any other offsets we should be thinking about? Did diesel benefit embedded to the upside (57:01)?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the diesel benefit is pretty much there in what we said on the, let's call it, $40 million full-year benefit. I don't see that moving dramatically, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And there's no acceleration in realized synergies? And then I'll get back in queue.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Look, I'm just going to take the $120 million and be really happy with that. So I think we are where we are.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. So either that's a non-answer or it's not getting realized sooner in 2015.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Look, I think there will be some synergies that will be realized in 2015. I'm just not prepared to quantify it precisely what that will be in 2015.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ted.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. Good afternoon.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Adam.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: You guys lowered your outlook for sales to the infrastructure market. I'm just curious if that's a reflection of the weather in the first half, or what your expectations are for the back half?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what, I think it's more a reflection of the weather in the first half. And it's a reflection of the drying out that's occurred in some markets. I was just talking with Ted on the last question, you do need a period of time not just for it not to rain after you've had this degree of dampness. But you frankly need some time for it just to dry out. And we're seeing some of that on barge stirrup (58:26) work that's going on, particularly in the Southwest right now. So, again, it's not a concern of what's going on from an underlying perspective, but it's simply looking at where we are after half one and some of the issues that I think we'll be faced with as an industry in the Southwest in half two.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And then for Texas, and last year you had an October price increase. Is that something you might do again this year?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Part of what I think we need to be sensitive to, you had so many kilns when it was wet, simply just shut down. And part of what I was gratified by during the shutdown, you didn't see a lot of erosion in pricing in that marketplace. And I think part of what we need to be focused on is really taking care of our customers here in the second half and being more focused on what we're going to do relative to the price in that Texas cement market going into 2016 as opposed to the back half now of this year.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets: Fair enough. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked. But could you comment on the slight pricing decline sequentially in aggregates? I mean, obviously weather played a role there, but was it more due to mix shift or a move of where aggregate was actually sold?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it probably would have been a little bit of both, but the simple fact is, if we're going location by location, product by product, everything is going up, which is why I would tell you it's going to be a little bit of both on geographic mix and product mix as well.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And thank you very much.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. This is Judy Merrick for Keith Hughes. I was just wondering if there's anything else you could add about the underlying growth in the non-residential market. You addressed the energy impact and kind of took that out. But particularly in light non-residential, was there some weather impact also? You mentioned that Texas has a big component. Or was a lot of the growth seen in the Florida/Georgia/other states?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: There were some components to weather in other states. I mean, if we go back and take a look at places like Colorado and Iowa and Indiana and others, they had some of the wettest quarters in history, so clearly weather was an issue there. But back to your point on really what's happening in non-res, for example, we're seeing the first speculative commercial building in Atlanta since before the crash. I mean we haven't seen that in a while. So clearly, we feel like Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Colorado is actually doing quite well in non-res. Again, if we go back to what we're seeing too in non-building, the non-building activity is pretty strong. Now, granted, this is going to tend to be the heavier as opposed to the office and retail type of work, but we're seeing good power plant, bridges, other non-building-type activity, but we are clearly seeing the speculative office. And again, that portion of our business before was up 22%. And we feel like the space in which we have a presence are really helping drive that.
Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, great. And on the decline in the heavy non-residential, was that mix of both energy and the weather?
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it was. Principally I would say clearly you're seeing a slowdown in shale as we anticipated, so that's some of it. And the other half was the weather. So I think that's clearly your one-two punch there.
Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Judy.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you again for joining our second quarter earnings call. We continue to be enthusiastic about the outlook for the balance of the year and expect to generate strong cash flow and return value for our shareholders through the repurchase program. We look forward to discussing our third quarter results with you in October. Thanks for your time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions].As a reminder this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Nye, please go ahead.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As announced in this morning's release, we reported a first quarter profit for the first time since 2008, another validation of our recent growth initiatives and cost management programs. Our results reflect aggregates product line volume growth, and a double-digit pricing increase, which we achieved despite severe late winter weather in many markets, and significant rainfall in Texas, which we estimate reduced West Group earnings by $13 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. The Magnesia Specialties business generated first quarter record net sales and gross profit and the acquired operations provided a significant contribution to our earnings and cash flow. Before providing specific comments on the quarter, I am pleased to tell you that the foundation, position and momentum within our business should translate into strong growth, as we expect to benefit from an environment of increasing demand for construction materials. As a preparatory reminder, today's conference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws, in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance, like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release, and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Consistent with recent quarters, I'll discuss the results with the Heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business, and two other small aggregates product line operations. While it's currently important to consider the results of Heritage versus acquired operations, so that we're fully transparent with our results and you can analyze and evaluate the quality of our financial performance. This comparison becomes less meaningful as we complete the integration of the TXI operations into our core business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion we've made available during this webcast and on our website, supplemental financial information that presents details of our performance. First, as detailed on slide two, the Heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes Magnesia specialties, provides the same-on-same comparison to the prior year first quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on slide four. And finally, on slide six, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance. Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the Heritage business. Slide three provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the Heritage aggregates business. First, we're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. It's important to note that the prior year first quarter includes shipments from three facilities in the West Group that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these three locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were up slightly, while shipments from the Heritage aggregates business increased 7%. Further, and as you're aware, our businesses is an outdoor undertaking, and weather can disproportionately affect quarterly results, particularly so in the first quarter. On the whole, winter weather was modestly better across our enterprise during the early portion of the quarter, as compared to last year. However, Texas precipitation this year was above average near record levels, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In fact, we estimate approximately 1.4 million tons of aggregates product line shipments were deferred from the first quarter to the remainder of the year. Heritage West Group aggregate volumes, excluding statements from the divested operations from the prior year quarter would have increased approximately 7.5%, had we not incurred weather delays. Ready mix concrete shipments were reduced by approximately 200,000 cubic yards, naturally profitability from these product lines was also negatively affected by lower production and efficiency levels. As previously discussed, we estimate West Group earnings were reduced by up to $13 million during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, our commitment to operational excellence, cost discipline, and continued synergy realization from the acquired businesses enabled us to post a very strong quarter. Aggregates product line growth was led by the infrastructure end use market, and driven by large projects. Notable growth was experienced in North Carolina and Iowa. This trend coincides with indicators of further recovery in the eastern half of the United States as North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida all now rank in the top five states for job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity. Texas is second in the nation in job growth and the State Department of Transportation has the fiscal 2015 letting budget of nearly $9 billion. This amount includes funds provided by Texas' Proposition 1 constitutional amendment, which addresses needed road repairs, including infrastructure work in south Texas. This amendment is expected to provide over $1 billion per annum for the foreseeable future and in fact over $1 billion has already been allocated to specific districts within Texas. This 2015 activity coupled with an existing backlog should generate robust infrastructure construction activity over the next several years. Additionally on March 1, 2015, Iowa enacted a $0.10 per gallon increase in the state gas tax, which is expected to increase annual infrastructure funding by approximately $215 million. Several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia are considering additional legislative measures to increase state level funding. We are pleased to see states continue to prioritize funding infrastructure initiatives while Congress deliberates the long-term Federal Highway bill. The provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP 21, have been extended through May 31st, and we anticipate another continuing resolution through the fall, while Congress works towards passage of a multi year bill. Shipments to the non-residential end use market were up slightly, as the economic recovery enters a more construction centric phase. For us, this market is broadly comprised of two components, light and heavy construction. And importantly, we're beginning to see a nascent return to a 50/50 balance between these two categories, a normal equilibrium. The light non-residential component is primarily office and retail, and demand of this component is generally tied more directly to residential demand with a 12 to 18-month lag. The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy, with both direct and energy related shipments serving this area. The heavy non-residential end use market represented 25% of quarterly Heritage aggregates volumes, and shipments increased 1% over the prior year quarter. Texas leads the country with $39 billion in non-residential starts during the trailing 12-months ended March 2015, and billions more expected to be started. Further, diversified state economies have generated other non-residential and infrastructure projects to replace direct energy sector shipments, currently displaced by volatile oil prices. The company expects energy related construction activity to remain strong, supported by more than $100 billion of planned projects along the Gulf Coast, including a significant portion in Texas. The residential end use market represented 15% of Heritage aggregate shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed compared with the last few years, in part due to an inventory reduction in the availability of unimproved building lots in our markets. We were encouraged to see Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina join Colorado, in recording double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12-months through March. This represents yet another sign of recovery in the eastern United States. Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the first quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 11% of our Heritage aggregates volume, and shipments were up slightly compared to the prior year quarter. A positive trend for this end use is the increasing investment in capacity expansion and maintenance by major railroads, which should lead to higher demand for balanced shipments. Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 10.5% over the prior year quarter. Led by the West Group, based on what we're expecting for the remainder of the year, we're raising full year aggregates product line pricing guidance from what was a projected increase of 4% to 6%, to now an increase of 7% to 9% over our 2014 results. Heritage Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped remain relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and on average pay $2.04 per gallon, compared with $3.18 in the prior year quarter. Heritage aggregates downstream related product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3 million, primarily driven by the ready mix concrete product line, where nearly 11% increase in average selling price, led to a 490 basis point increase in the product line gross margin. Gross profit for the Heritage Aggregates business increased $27 million and was 9.7% of net sales, an improvement of 730 basis points over the prior year quarter. All reportable segments generated a higher gross margin, led by an increase of 1,040 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia, and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our Heritage business generated an incremental gross margin of 76%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. This performance was led by long-awaited recovery in both the Mideast and Southeast divisions. We expect continued economic recovery in other geographic areas hardest hit over the past several years. The Magnesia Specialties business continues its exceptional performance and generated net sales of $58.8 million, and a gross profit of $20.2 million, both of which represent first quarter records. For the quarter the business achieved a gross margin of 34.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter. Slides four and five provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the first quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $32 million, on external shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.83 per ton, which reflects a product mix skewed towards higher priced sand and gravel and rail yard shipments, compared to our Heritage operations. Despite the negative impact of weather during the quarter, we're pleased to deliver gross margin improvement compared with performance in the second half of 2014. Our recently acquired Ready Mix concrete business shipped nearly 1 million cubic yards during the quarter, at an average selling price of $88.75. This reflects the $6 per cubic yard increase implemented last August in the north Texas market. As a reminder, pricing increases typically have a six-month lag before full realization. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected operations, and reduced the profitability of this business by an estimated $6 million. The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. However, first quarter operating results were negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year. For the first quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers, at an average selling price of $93.41 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $96 million. The business achieved a gross margin of nearly 20% after incurring $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We expect to incur $2 million of similar costs in the second quarter, with $11 million and $10 million of such expenses in both the third and fourth quarters respectively. During the first quarter, the company announced a price increase of $10 per ton in the Texas and California markets effective April 1. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 7.8% of net sales, a decline of 120 basis points. This improvement reflects net sales growth outpacing the increase in SG&A, partially offset by higher pension expansion. We also incurred net acquisition related expenses of $1.6 million, which reflects our estimated run rate for the next few quarters. As detailed on slide six, our reported earnings from operations for the quarter of $25.6 million improved $41.5 million from the prior year quarter loss of $15.9 million. Our synergy expectations are consistent with our most recent guidance, we should complete the systems integration for the cement and Ready Mix concrete businesses during the second quarter, in line with our integration plan. We recorded a small income tax benefit for the quarter, driven by discrete events. However, excluding the discrete events, our effective income tax rate would have been 31%, in line with our full-year guidance. For the year, we expect to fully utilize allowable net operating loss carry forwards of $363 million, which will reduce cash taxes. For the quarter, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow compared with $7 million for 2014. The increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in the first quarter of 2015 for the 2014 tax year. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was slightly less than 2.5 times in compliance with our leverage covenant, and within our targeted range. As a reminder, we have Board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. We expect to complete the program over the next few years. However the actual time will depend on available cash and the market price of our stock during the time frame. Moving to our full year guidance, we anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with stronger employment gains, and construction end use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the western United States to continue, and importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies we expect growth in our three largest end use markets. Infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid single digits. Non-residential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase, and the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12%, with 4% to 7% growth in the Heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. Again, we expect aggregate's product line pricing to now be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregate's product line production cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales, and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million, and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%, despite an $18 million increase in Heritage pension costs over 2014. On a consolidated basis we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA, ranging from $835 million to $875 million. Interest expense should approximate $75 million to $80 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be 31%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy related capital, and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry, outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern and highly efficient rail connected quarry, capable of shipping products to south Texas, including Houston, for generations. To conclude, we are very excited about the future of Martin Marietta Materials. Our commitment to core foundational pillars, world class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability, and customer satisfaction, along with the growing demand for construction materials, should lead to improved profitability, and allow us to continue to increase shareholder value. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Todd Vencil: Good afternoon, guys.
Ward Nye: Hello, Todd.
Todd Vencil: Let's talk about incrementals first. 76% is a pretty good number I would say. I'm guessing strength in the price increase was a big factor in that. Can you talk about what else went into that?
Ward Nye: Yes, part of what you're seeing, Todd, you're just seeing that Southeast part of the United States come back a little bit. But you heard what those incrementals looked like in a state like Georgia, so you're entirely right. Does pricing help, yes it does. Does cost management help, yes it does. Does geographic mix where you're starting to see some business comeback help a lot, it does. I mean, let's talk a little bit about what we saw relative to our production analysis just on the cost side. I mean, the pricing side I think you can see with greater clarity, but if we're looking at total Heritage aggregates cost per ton, they declined 17%, or 2% after adjusting for increased production volumes. What we did, Todd, is we were able to fully capture a 36% decline per gallon in diesel costs during the quarter, but we saw Heritage production volume go up 12%, or 2.9 million tons. So what's happening at the end of the day, is separate and distinct from what's going on in pricing, is each incremental ton was produced at 20% lower than it was in 2014 from an actual cost per ton, so you're seeing it on both sides of the equation. The pricing I think from the release really jumps out and hits you in the face. But I think what's happening on the cost side, and what's happening geographically is important in that 76%, as well.
Todd Vencil: Got it. That's great. And then one other for me, and I'll give other people a chance to ask questions. But you talked about a pick up in subdivision development. Can you go into that a little more? Is there any quantifying you can do around that or at least talk about places where that’s strengthening up?
Ward Nye: We're clearly seeing better housing in the East than we seen for a while. I mean, housing is completely following the playbook that we thought we would see. Permits were up 5%. Starts were up 10%, completions at 12%. But here are the stats that move me. Permits are ahead of starts, starts are ahead of completions. And even when we're sitting here with those types of metrics, housing still remains well below historical averages. So I think it gives us a great deal of upside. What we're seeing too is its being fueled by employment gains. So if you go back to those states that we outlined in my comments, where we're seeing good employment movement, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, that's what's driving a lot of that. The other thing that I'm moved by, Todd, is the very tepid recovery in housing has really spurred pricing. So we can imagine what a really good market in housing is going to look like, but that's what we're seeing right now, Todd.
Todd Vencil: Just a follow up on that, am I right to think that subdivision development is sort of a lot steadier and longer tailed than the more sort of specifically related to, lot development or what goes on in a house?
Ward Nye: It is. One, it's a good early indicator. Two, it's longer lived. Three, it's more aggregate intensive because remember, Todd, when we talk about res, we are not just talking about the rock going into the lot development. We're talking about the lot going into the subdivision streets, the subdivision sidewalks, the subdivision utilities. That's part of what drives the comment that I said about moving to a more construction centric phase of recovery, and that clearly is moving towards more subdivision development, yes.
Todd Vencil: Yes. Thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First question I have is around energy in Texas, just for practical purposes, the volumes that were impacted by weather particularly in March, do you view those as delayed or lost? And then the second tag that's related to Texas, could you give more color on trends that you've seen for shale play specific volumes, and in your opinion has Prop 1, or will Prop 1 be more than enough to offset those volume losses that were going to pad build out? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure, Kathryn. Volume lost in Q1 is not gone. It's deferred, and it's deferred to the balance of the year. So I feel comfortable we'll capture all of that. And clearly a lot of that was driven by rain. I mean, I don't want to turn into a weatherman here today, but I looked at something to me that I thought was moving on how weather affected particularly north Texas. If we look at water reservoirs in north Texas, a year ago they were 68% full. If we look at where they were three months ago, they were 64% full. And if we look at where they are today, they're 94% full. I mean, that's remarkable rain in north Texas. That's what among other things gives me confidence that volume has been pushed to the right, it's not volume that's gone. What we are seeing in non-res in other parts of Texas continues to be very strong. We feel comfortable that whatever weakness we're seeing in shale energy, yes, will be picked up by housing, and yes will be picked up by other components of non-res. And to answer your question really directly on what we're seeing relative to shale, it's an uneven story. I mean, here is what I see. I see volumes down in first quarter in Eagle Ford shale 31%. I see volumes up in Haynesville 142%. Now, the short answer is do I think they're going to be down overall just pure shale volumes? Yes, I do. But here's my take on it, Kathryn. I think they're going to look a lot like they did in 2012. And in 2012, all rolled in we sold about 6 million tons to the different shale plays and when I think back to 2012, number one, everybody liked the way 2012 felt. And nobody really thought they would be that good. So do we think it will be back in the 2012 level in 2015? We do. Are we seeing uneven movement in some of the plays? We are. Do we think the volume that was lost in Q1 was simply deferred? We do. I think I answered your questions. Is that responsive?
Kathryn Thompson: Yes. Yes. And then my final follow-up question, just around guidance, fantastic growth in pricing. Is the conservatism or the factors driving your decision not to raise EBITDA guidance more, is it driven by you were saying listen we just want to be conservative, or is there any other factor that we should take into consideration for that EBITDA?
Ward Nye: What Kathryn I guess what I would say to is, it's April. And pricing was just so strong, honestly. You just had to come back and adjust that. I talked through on the previous answer what we were look like on the cost profile. So what I would say to you is the cost profile looks good. The pricing looks good. The geography looks good. And if someone wants to accuse us of being conservative, I'll probably take the accusation.
Anne Lloyd: Kathryn, we did obviously bring up the lower end of that range. So…
Kathryn Thompson: That’s good thing, yes.
Anne Lloyd: We did tighten it a little bit for you.
Kathryn Thompson: Yes, yes, absolutely. That’s a great point, I left that out. But yes, you did title the range. But to your point, just being more conservative than getting over your skis too much?
Ward Nye: Yes, Kathryn, that's it.
Kathryn Thompson: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions today.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Timna Tanners: Yes, hello. Good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon, Timna.
Timna Tanners: I think along the lines of Kathryn's question, I think I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the aggregate pricing in particular, because if we were to trend the first quarter through the full year, then you would already be on the high end of your guidance, so I know the first quarter can be skewed by low volumes. But do you think that's a good run rate, or is it just back to that just seeing how it goes kind of approach?
Ward Nye: It's funny, Timna. if I look across our enterprise, prices are up everywhere. And prices are up everywhere, there are some places that pricing is up over 30%. And obviously you don't want see that everywhere, but that gives you a sense of pricing, so it's actually very strong. And mix in the first quarter did not have a profound effect on what was going on with this. So we do want to let this play out a little bit more. But clearly, when you're seeing volumes ramp up, we're going to see the pricing come behind that.
Timna Tanners: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. So just switching gears to some item, I'm rusty on the topic, and you announced a price hike you said for April, you mentioned specifically that Texas was tight, so it sounds like that can pass, and usually if I recall it takes a little bit of time to see that flow through like you mentioned in Ready Mix. Are you as confident on the price increase in California, and is the market tight enough to perhaps warrant a further increase, can you comment on that?
Ward Nye: Yes, we're certainly going to come back and we're going to look at more increases in cement pricing as we get into the year. What I can tell you right now up through Q1, cement pricing in north Texas it was up 11%, and in south Texas it was up 19%. In California it was up 15%. So to your point those are pretty nice percentage moves that we're seeing in pricing in those markets. And again we have a leading position in the Texas markets, but even where we have the leading positions I think is important. This is not a west Texas cement play. This is a north Texas and south central Texas cement play. So we continue to feel very confident about where we sit in pricing in those markets.
Timna Tanners: Okay. So just I had to clarify those, California is looking like it sounds like just as strong as Texas. But I wasn't sure if it's not as tight a market, or if it is also looking quite tight?
Ward Nye: It is not as tight a market as Texas is, I'll certainly concede that. And the total pricing isn't right now as attractive as it is in Texas. But from a percentage perspective frankly it's moving somewhere on a percentage perspective, between where it is in south Texas and where it is in north Texas right now. And I think that's a good sign for a market moving toward in a very steady fashion equilibrium between supply and demand.
Timna Tanners: Super. Thank you so much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Garik Shmois: Thank you. Just a follow-up question on cement pricing. You indicated that you had I think I heard 19% year-over-year growth in north Texas. Just wondering how much of that growth is related to lower price projects coming off backlog and being replaced by market pricing on current jobs? And also, if you could maybe provide a little bit of color on how to think about some of these low price TXI projects, how should they roll off as you look into 2015, and what the potential mix benefit would look like over the remaining three quarters?
Ward Nye: Yes, here is the way I look at that. The different TXI price projects should roll off by the end of the year. So I think we just have to continue to feather that in throughout the year. I think it's hard to give you a percentage on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but – so that's going to be something that we will see in varying degrees for 2015. It will be gone at the end of 2015. If you think back to what was going on on some of those longer haul cement moves, that was really more of a south Texas issue, than it was a north Texas issue. And then if we're going back to the percentages that I spoke of, the increases that we're seeing in south Texas are 19%. So I think that does come back and tie to a degree here.
Garik Shmois: Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up question, if there is a nit to pick we think on the quarter it would be on incremental margins in the West Group within the Aggregates business. Just wondering if you maybe can provide a little bit of clarity on specifically what is happening in the West Group, and can we realistically see incrementals in the West Group come up to look a lot like the incrementals that you are showing in your other regions?
Ward Nye: Yes, the short answer is over time you can. Here is the West Group story. It was Colorado in January and February and March, which is winter in the Rockies, and it was really going back to a story in north Texas. If you think about what we are in Texas today after the TXI transaction, yes, our position in Houston is important, our position in San Antonio is important. Our position in Austin is important. But the north Texas market is the biggest single market that we have there. And when we're looking at the sheer degree of rain that we had in the days that we could not work in that marketplace, that's the single biggest driver. Now again we're seeing pricing move on a percentage basis in the West better than we are the East. That's not a surprise. In large part because it just has more room to go. But what I would say is one, dry weather is your friend, pricing is your friend, but increased efficiencies will continue to be as well. And we think we'll see that. So with the incrementals in the West, be as attractive as the East with immediacy, no. They never really have. Do we think they'll close the gap over time? Yes. And will it close the gap at different speeds and different markets? The answer to that is yes as well.
Anne Lloyd: And Garik, this is Anne. I would remind you that we had about $13 million profit impact of weather on the West Group in the quarter.
Ward Nye: That's really north Texas.
Anne Lloyd: That's really north Texas. If you throw that, or add that back in, and you've got a pretty decent incrementals.
Garik Shmois: Okay. So if we throw that $13 million back in assuming normal weather moving forward, that's a more realistic incremental that we should be thinking about?
Ward Nye: Garik, it should be that…
Anne Lloyd: Directionally, yes.
Garik Shmois: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Drew Lipke: Yes, good afternoon, guys. This is Drew Lipke on for Trey.
Ward Nye: Hi, Drew.
Drew Lipke: My first question just kind of goes back to pricing in the West Group, you saw it up 17%, you mentioned volumes there relatively flat. I'm curious you talked about the Eagle Ford volumes being down 30% there, and I understand ASPs on that business are lower. Can you talk about the mix within that piece and the impact that had on pricing overall?
Ward Nye: I can because we went and looked at mix overall in the business, and actually if anything, mix was a little bit of a headwind for us, not a tailwind for us, oddly enough. I think in part because you are seeing increased infrastructure activity in Texas. You are seeing different types of non-res. So you're right, sometimes you're just swapping base for base. So if you're scratching there, and I understand why you would, if you're scratching there to try to find out is there some noise and what's going on from a mix perspective, that's either masking or otherwise confusing the pricing story there's really not…
Anne Lloyd: Yes, if you look at the actual numbers Drew, it is like 2 basis points. So it's no impact.
Drew Lipke: Okay. Good to hear. And then on the EBITDA guidance, you raised the lower end, I am curious, you budgeted originally back in October, and you're using October diesel prices at the time, you said diesel was $2.09 in the quarter. So does your current guidance, what kind of diesel impact does that reflect?
Ward Nye: We're capturing some of that, Drew, candidly we're not capturing all of that because none of us are so good to sort out exactly what we think that's going to be for the balance of the year. So again, perhaps there is an element of conservatism in that, and we're willing to take that. And again we'll come back and talk to you more about it when we're back in half year. But that's really how we're approaching it right now.
Drew Lipke: Okay. Congrats on a great quarter. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Drew, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Hey, good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Anne Lloyd: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about within the West Group is where you saw the most dramatic price increases. How broad-based is that, is that really across the board, any mix contribution within that? And I guess when were the bulk of the price increases put through, and should we get a bigger tailwind in Q2 in that region?
Ward Nye: If you think back to last year we actually saw mid years in all the markets in Texas, and we came back and had price increases at the beginning of this year as well. And what I would say Jerry, I'd rather not go market-by-market through Texas, but what I'll tell is the lowest one that I'm seeing even in sub-markets is 10%, and others are obviously considerably more attractive than that. So we're seeing good solid pricing across that entire marketplace, which again I think is indicative of continued momentum there, and a continued positive outlook. If contractors feel like they're seeing something awfully challenging coming their way, I don't think we would see that type of pricing momentum in every corner of our business in that state. And when we're speaking to West Group, I need to pause on Colorado too. We're seeing good movement on aggregate pricing in the Colorado market. And again, part of what I believe we're going to see, Jerry, is more of a hard rock influence coming into markets north of Denver. Simply because they have alluvial plays they are playing out and again, we've got what I think is the premier hard rock position in that Denver market. So both in Texas and Colorado, which really define in many respects the West Group on aggs, that's the story I see on pricing right now.
Jerry Revich: Thank you. And then at times you put in price increases in April 1st instead of January 1st, should we look for a bigger price increase on a year-over-year basis as a result in 2Q in the West Group, or were most price increases effective January 1?
Ward Nye: I would say the majority of them were effective January 1. Frankly some did go in April, but remember Jerry, it's not usually, particularly markets like Colorado, not a lot of aggs are moving in January. And so I'm not sure in this instance, the timing would have made that big a difference. I just still think the overall market and the movement in pricing to me it is really moving. I'll just put it that way.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then philosophically can you talk about pricing in cement? Some folks are talking about an environmental surcharge of $5 per ton in mid-September. What are your thoughts around that topic, are you planning something similar?
Ward Nye: Well, we certainly plan to come back and look at what we feel like the price increases need to be for later in the year. I think coming back at some point and looking at another $10 a ton is not unrealistic, and I think that's the type of conversation that we're going to be having with our customers. Obviously I feel like, Texas will continue to be a sold out market. I mean, the way that we're seeing Texas, even with bringing on some additional capacity, we talked about that before, we thought that we would come back in 2014 and add some additional capacity in that state. We're still seeing that Texas is going to be short on domestic supply by almost 3.8 million tons. Keep in mind last year they were short on domestic supply by 3.7 million tons. So what we're seeing is actually a tighter market in 2015 there than we saw in 2014. I think a tight market probably gives you a sense of what should happen with pricing.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: All right. Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Craig Bibb: Hi. Just one quick question. Shale aggregate volume in 2012 was 6 million tons. What was it last year?
Ward Nye: Shale aggregate volume last year was about 7.5.
Craig Bibb: I am sorry, that was shale volume was…
Ward Nye: Yes, in 2012, and that's when we say we feel like it will be like this year, we think its around little over 6 million, and for the full year in 2014 pure direct shale volume was 7.4 million.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And feeling like 7.4 million on 2015 so far, but it's early?
Ward Nye: I'm sorry Craig, I missed that.
Craig Bibb: It sounded like from your comments that it's feeling like 7.4 flattish in 2015 per shale volume even with the oil uncertainty?
Ward Nye: That's what I thought I was saying, Craig. I think we'll be back close to 6 million tons.
Craig Bibb: Okay.
Ward Nye: In 2012, 6 million tons felt pretty good.
Craig Bibb: Okay. And the October $10 price increase for cement, how long did it take you to realize that?
Ward Nye: It's obviously going to vary from market-to-market, but give that a quarter to quarter and half usually.
Craig Bibb: And you realize all of it, is just takes a quarter to quarter half?
Ward Nye: It's going to take a quarter to quarter half.
Craig Bibb: Okay. If US steel production turns down does that have an impact on Magnesia Specialty?
Ward Nye: Yes, what we're seeing right now is steel the quarter running modestly over 70%. We're still seeing a very good business there. We're seeing a very good chemicals business in particular. Keep in mind US steel demand grew by 13% in 2014 to 118 million tons, compared to 105 million tons in 2013. So with this sheer amount of par manufacturing that we're seeing, with the strength that we're seeing in our chemicals business, and with some of the customer relationships that we have, we feel very good about where we're see sitting in mag specialties.
Anne Lloyd: This is a reminder Craig, the dolomitic lime that we produce in mag specialties is the product that really most directly goes in to steel. We are actually a purchaser of dolomitic lime to supply our chemicals business. So we do believe if there is some dislocation there, we have got room to absorb some of that in our chemicals business.
Ward Nye: Craig, the other element that's important separate and distinct from the steel is what's happening with energy there, and actually much of what we saw was natural gas prices for our kilns come down pretty considerably Q1 last year to Q1 this year. We saw that come down about 30%, and we feel like that's going to stay at a pretty good steady number for the balance of the year.
Craig Bibb: And the last one, with Ready Mix do you have room to go ahead and take price there coincident with the cement price increase?
Ward Nye: Well again, I think that's going to be a market-by-market phenomenon, because you're going to see very different prices depending on whether you're in Denver or whether you're in Dallas or frankly even if you're in some community relatively close to Dallas, but outside of the Metroplex. So that’s going to be a sub-market by sub-market decision. But if cement is going up Ready Mix is going to go up.
Craig Bibb: Great. Thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ted Grace: Hey guys, nice quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Ted. How are you?
Ted Grace: I'm great, how are you doing?
Ward Nye: I can't complain.
Ted Grace: Good. As I typically do, Anne, could we go through a bridge on the aggregate operations? I know slide six on your deck gives a couple big pieces. But I was just wondering if we could dig into the kind of like nuances within the volume pricing, and I guess the cost side, as well, which, can we start there?
Anne Lloyd: Well, Ted if you look at slide six, we break it down between the Heritage aggregate product line, the Heritage aggregates related downstream product line, which would be the Ready Mix business and paving, and the acquired businesses. So it's all laid out for you on slide six.
Ted Grace: Could you go through what the cost factors were, that $14.3 million dynamic?
Anne Lloyd: Primarily it's because of increased production volume. As Ward indicated earlier production volume was up about 12% for the quarter. And so you've got costs, you've got costs just increasing from the sheer number of tons you're producing.
Ward Nye: The other issue that's there Ted to be clear, we did pull some maintenance or repair forward and we did have some additional stripping in the quarter, as well, because we're anticipating a heavy volume year. So we accelerated a little bit of that, we believe. But I think those probably are the primary drivers that Anne outlined.
Ted Grace: Okay. And then I guess, on a similar note to some other questions I know you have seen pricing up 29, and that gives you 10.5 points or so year-on-year, and just the way you reflected it looks like that's all true economic capture of pricing. So I guess I come back to the question, if you flow through an extra 300 basis points, that's $30 million to $45 million of incremental EBITDA. I know there's the conservatism, but I mean, is there anything else we need to be aware of that has led to you. I mean, just logically if you left all other aspects of your guidance unchanged as you did in the press release, and you flow through $30 million to $45 million of EBITDA, it's just hard to understand why we're keeping the numbers flat or $10 million the low end, excuse me.
Ward Nye: No, Ted, look, I hear you. I mean, the only thing I can say is its still April. And I think just changing a full year EBITDA number, on last time I checked EBITDA numbers the people thought were pretty healthy EBITDA numbers, just didn't feel right in March, April. And as I said we can come back and revisit that here in the next quarter. But we just felt like until we had one more quarter under our belts, let's just watch this.
Ted Grace: Okay. And on the pricing data you gave us, I think in Texas you said it was up 10% or better, did I hear that correctly, to Jerry's question?
Ward Nye: Yes, what I was saying is that if I was looking across major and minor markets, I think what I was essentially saying is, I wasn't seeing anything that wasn't up at least 10%. So I was really bracketing on the lowest end, just to give you that lowest denominator.
Ted Grace: Yes, that’s rappel [ph] So I guess the question is, you bought a lot of assets in Texas, there is some debate whether they were kind of effectively pricing. Can you talk about at 10%, was that kind of coming up to where the market is, was the whole market moving up at that rate? Just it would be helpful to get some context o what that 10% was in the broader context of what the markets are doing?
Ward Nye: I guess, Ted, what I would say is you still got in most markets in Texas markets that are below our corporate average. And so what I would tell you is you're seeing higher percentage movement in the West than the East. But you continue in my view to have more room in the West to move at higher percentages. So if I'm looking at these percentages they're very attractive. If I'm looking at the prices, they're getting candidly to what I feel like is a much more acceptable and appropriate level. But I also still believe in a number of those markets you've got a lot of room ahead of you.
Ted Grace: Sure. That's great to hear. Again, nice quarter and best of luck this future quarter.
Ward Nye: Ted, thanks so much. We'll talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on a strong quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Ward you brought up the Tx DoT spending budget for this year is $9 billion. Do you have any sense for what that looks like for next year?
Ward Nye: It's going to continue to be strong in large part, because let's think of it two different ways Adam. Number one they continue to have the billion dollars from Prop 17 profile. Let's keep in mind too, Texas is a fiscal year that ends in August, not June. So it's different than many of our states. We've got an $8 billion or call it $9 billion budget this year that's coming on the tail of a couple of three record DoT budgets in Texas. So what I would tell you is anybody who tells you what they think Texas is going to be next year and the year after is going to be wrong, because if we looked at Texas, and we went back two or three years and did that same look forward, we too would have been wrong. It’s just consistently been better than anyone would have thought. And part of what I find moving and what's going on in Texas right now that $1.1 billion that's already been basically dedicated for this year under Prop 1, when we come back and look at what that means it's $85 million in Austin. It's $82 million in Dallas. It's $206 million in Houston, and its $147 million in San Antonio. So if we think back over the last several years on the part of Texas that was not getting as much infrastructure as some of the others, it was places like San Antonio that now have a toll system, and they didn't before and they're seeing a good slug from Prop 1. So as we're looking at infrastructure in Texas right now, what our team in Texas would tell me is Ward we've got two, three or four years of good work ahead of us right now.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask about the mix between res and non-res. I think last quarter you said that you expected non-res to grow faster than res, this quarter you are saying res was a little faster than non-res, I'm just wondering if that's because the res outlook went up, and the non-res outlook came down a little bit?
Ward Nye: Actually if you think about it our outlook is for non-res to be in the high single digits, and for res to be in double-digit growth. So I see from a growth perspective I think what we're saying in our forecast is consistent with it. What I would tell you too is the mix of business that we have from a pure bucket perspective, would call it 45% infrastructure, 30% non-res, and 15% res is a pretty normalized percentage. They all need to be lifted up, and that's what we're seeing. But from a pure breakdown of business geographically and end use across our company and our business, we don't feel bad with those percentages. We're just looking forward to more volume. We think more volume continues to create an enduring good pricing story.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks, Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brent Thielman: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Ward, your optimism on Texas is crystal clear, but was curious in some of the other energy exposed regions around the country, Oklahoma, around the Marcellus, I know you don't have as much exposure there. But are you seeing any evidence of slowing construction activities or starts?
Ward Nye: No, I mean, we're not. I mean, did we see some pure slow down in pure energy that's going in some of those? Yes, we do. But again, from a pure volume perspective, Texas just so much outweighs those. And I think the other thing that gives me some optimism about Texas, is most shale plates break even at the $50 to $60 per barrel, and $50 is I think a key threshold of pain for a lot of different areas. Texas and what's going on in Eagle Ford, is really one of the more competitive areas. So really one of the most competitive areas with the biggest volume for us, is again we think back to the 2012 level that we view relatively attractively. So could there be some headwinds in Niobrara? Maybe. Could there be some headwinds in Marcellus? Maybe. Do we continue to believe those are offset by other non-res activity and res? We feel very strongly that it will.
Brent Thielman: Yes. Got it. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Brent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mike Betts: Yes. Thank you very much. I had two or three quick questions if I could, please, Ward and Anne. First one you gave some, I think it was $11 million in Q3, and $10 million in Q4 of expected maintenance spend in cement. Could you remind me what it was last year so I've got some idea in terms of modeling? Secondly, we have just received a Texas cement data, it was very weak in March. Could you talk – did that have any impact at all on trying to put the price increases through, because presumably people were pretty disappointed by a double-digit decline in volumes, which appears to be the case in March. And then thirdly, could you talk about what California volumes did? I don't know if the figures for the quarter a year ago, but some idea of what the trend in terms of shipments is going on there? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Absolutely Mike. What we'll do, let's talk a little bit about what we think happens with kiln maintenance because as you outlined Mike, forecast $5.4 million, actually that is what we spent in Q1, $2 million forecast in Q2, $11.2 million in Q3, and $10.3 million in Q4. What we had told you that we would do early in the year was around $33.3 million worth of kiln expense for the year. We think we're coming in now at $28.9 million. So it's going to be about a $4.4 million difference, as a practical matter that's just looking at the way the marketplace is moving. I think the challenge is that you're seeing in cement in those March numbers were more weather and location driven than anything else. I do think west Texas is clearly a very different cement market than the cement markets in which we participate. So to the extent that those are almost purely energy driven, we are not going to feel that pain. I think we come back to the notion that we discussed Mike, and that is almost under any mathematics we see, Texas is almost $4 million on domestic supply short this year. So from a pricing perspective, I think we're going to be in fine shape. That doesn't concern me.
Mike Betts: Okay. And the $11.2 million and the $10.3 million Q3 and Q4, what did that compare to last year?
Ward Nye: We were at $8.1 million in Q3 last year, and it looks like there was none in four last year, I believe those are the numbers. And then again there would have been spend in Q1 and Q2 last year, but we don't have those.
Mike Betts: Okay. And then some idea if you have what the California volumes are doing? I mean, I know you didn't own the business a year ago, but you have some idea of what they've done in the quarter roughly?
Ward Nye: Well, we feel like from a volume perspective, California volume was up 9%. So again, we're seeing good volume growth in California right now. I think that goes back to the question that Timna asked as well, relative to what are you seeing there, when do you think, what's going to happen with pricing in that market. And that type of almost double-digit volume number up, is what gives us the continued confidence that market is on its way back to a supply demand equilibrium.
Mike Betts: Last question, what utilization rates are you now running at in California?
Ward Nye: You are Mr. Cement today, Mike. And across what we're seeing across our enterprise right now is probably something in the low to mid-80s, particularly coming out of Q1. So we're obviously looking to ramp those up as you may recall from our Investor Analyst day. We view 90% as a world class number, and our aim is to get it there.
Mike Betts: Understood. And thank you very much.
Ward Nye: All right. Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for any further remarks.
Ward Nye: Danielle, thank you. And thank you all for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are excited about the first quarter trends in case you couldn't tell, and we're going to work hard to build on this momentum throughout the year. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in July. Thanks for your time today, and for your continued support at Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-10 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Ward Nye - Chairman and CEO Anne Lloyd - Executive Vice President and CFO

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Martin Marietta Q4 2014 and Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As announced in this morning's release, we were pleased to complete the transformation year in 2014 from Martin Marietta culminating with the 77% increase in fourth quarter net earnings over the prior year quarter. Our results reflect growth in the Heritage aggregates business, the expanding contribution from the acquired TXI operations and the consistently strong performance by our Magnesia Specialties business. Additionally, we also announced a 20 million share repurchase program on which I'll further elaborate later in the teleconference. In addition to earnings growth, we were pleased to announce positive developments related to the TXI synergies. First, we exceeded our previously announced guidance for 2014 by 53% or nearly $10 million. Second, based on our integration progress to date, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016 more than 40% over our previous guidance. This rate of synergy realization made the TXI acquisition modestly accretive to 2014 earnings excluding of course to one-time costs related to the transaction. This accretion should continue into 2015 and beyond based on incremental synergy realization coupled with continued growth in the underlying business.  These developments confirmed our ability to deliver on our objectives and create additional shareholder value. Before further discussing the quarterly and full year results, as a reminder, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connections with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. To continue to provide transparency into our fourth quarter results, we will again discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of acquired operations. To facilitate this discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that is consistent with how management analyzes the business. First, as detailed on Slide 2, the Heritage Martin Marietta business which includes Magnesia Specialties provides the same-on-same comparison to the prior fourth year quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally on Slide 7, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better understand the drivers of our performance.  Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the Heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the Heritage aggregates business. We are pleased to report volume growth in all product lines and in all reportable groups within the aggregates product line. Additionally, pricing strength was notable in both aggregates and ready mix concrete product lines. Consistent with trends seeing through our 2014, fourth quarter aggregates business growth was led by robust activity in our West Group primarily in Texas and Colorado. Texas continues to benefit from a strong state department of transportation with the cumulative budget of $20 billion over fiscal years 2013 to 2015; Texas has created a sizable project backlog. This public work is naturally separate and distinct from a very healthy private sector in Texas. Thus all the aggregates product line shipping increase in the West Group was approximately 8.5%. The same-on-same comparison reflects growth of more than 15%. This comparison excludes shipments in the prior year quarter from the North Troy Quarry in Oklahoma and two rail yards in the Dallas area, which were divested in the third quarter of 2014.  This transaction was actually the only required divestiture for the approval of the TXI acquisition by the United States Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino review. North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all rank in the top five states for employment growth. A catalyst for construction activity. Consistent with this trend, recovery in the construction market is underway in the Eastern half of the country although currently lagging the west. Heritage aggregates product line volumes in the mid-America group which increase to 7.7% reflects growth throughout North Carolina. The South East Group benefited from activity --increased activity in Florida with the TIFIA funded I-4 project is beginning and the housing market is also improving.  Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. The infrastructure market represented 44% of quarterly volumes and the shipments to this sector increased 12%. This growth reflects double-digit improvement in each reportable group and notably was achieved while the Federal Transportation funding is being provided under a continuing resolution through May 31. During this time, we've seen increase in momentum for a multiyear federal highway bill. The executive and congressional branches of government each recognized the need to invest in the country's aging and deficient infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for new bill, the main area of debate continues to be the funding source. The nonresidential end use market represented 32% quarterly Heritage volumes and shipments increased 4% over the prior year quarter. Growth was achieved in the commercial and energy sectors. While declining oil prices caused concern about the sustainability of energy related projects, we don't expect the significant impact on our business based on both the backlog and the momentum of committed projects as well as $100 billion of anticipated projects along the Gulf Coast, a significant portion of which are in Texas. Additionally, late last year Texas voters approved proposition one which authorizes annual disbursements from the state's existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund. An estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred this fiscal year alone. The residential end use market represented 15% of quarterly Heritage aggregates product line volumes and shipments increased 5% over the prior year quarter. We continue to experience significant residential construction growth in our western markets. By way of example, for the 12 months ending December 31, 2014, residential starts rose 33% in San Antonio, 10% in Houston, and 37% in Austin. This reaffirms our view of the value of the company's strategic growth initiatives made over the last several years which should continue to benefit our future demand.  Finally to conclude the discussion of end use markets, ChemRock/Rail represented the remaining 9% of our Heritage aggregates product line volume and shipments increasing 5% versus the prior year quarter. This growth reflects an increase in ballast shipments partially offset by a slowdown in agricultural land shipments. Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong and we're pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Pricing increased 6% over the prior year quarter led by 9% increase in the West Group. For the full year, Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 4% in line with our guidance. Aggregates product line cost per ton shift declined to 2% compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction reflects increased operating leverage and an 11% decline in energy costs driven by lower oil prices. The Heritage aggregates related downstream product lines increased their total gross profit $5 million. The ready mix concrete product line experienced pricing and volume increases of 11% and 2% respectively, which led to an 840 basis points in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported 16% increase in its net sales. Gross profit for the Heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 21.7% of net sales, an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year quarter. Notably the Heritage ready mix concrete business gross margin expanded 570 points. These are primarily the operations acquired in the Denver market at the end of 2011 which have demonstrated steady improvements since the acquisition. We expect the similar trend in the acquired TXI ready mix business. Our specialty products business posted record fourth quarter net sales of $58.2 million and a gross margin of 39% contributing earnings from operations of $19.8 million. Slide 4 through 6 provides financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the fourth quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $31 million on shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.13 per ton helped by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments. Performance in the Aggregates business did improve at an accelerated pace given the strength of underlying market demand and synergy realization. The acquired ready mix concrete business shift 1.3 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $82.74.  In the South West, fourth quarter selling prices and production costs are typically lower than in the warmer months when temperature control measures are required during the production process. Such measures are passed on as additive pricing when incurred. A $6 per yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1st. For realization of the increase will likely take six months as we work through the current backlog.  As a reminder, the cement business includes a leading position in the Texas markets and the state-of-the-art rail located cement plant in Southern California. The Texas plants continue to operate in markets where demand currently exceeds local available supply. A trend expected to continue for the near future. In the fourth quarter, we shift 1 million tons of cement. Cement pricing of $93.02 per ton is $7.07 or 8.2% higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the cement business generated $100 million of net sales and $28 million in gross profit. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating below 70% utilization reflective of a slower Southern California construction economy recovery. We continue to anticipate California markets should reach the supply demand equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership is implementing strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, plant utilization at efficiency thereby creating a roadmap for significantly improved future profitability.  Our remaining key area of emphasis is to increase and accelerate the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. We're thus pleased to announce our revised expectations of $100 million of annual synergies by 2016. For the second half of 2014, we achieved synergies of nearly $28 million, 53% above our guidance. These results are not possible without the relentless and effective efforts of our workforce. I'm proud to thank and commend our employees for their stellar progress. We planned to complete the systems integration for the cement and ready mix concrete businesses no later than June of this year, accordingly and as planned certain duplicative corporate overhead costs will continue through that time.  As previously announced, we acquired over $500 million of TXI's net operating loss of NOL carry forwards. We used $48 million of these benefits to reduce our cash taxes to 17% of our income tax expense. We expect to utilize the remaining NOLs over the next two to three years. For the fourth quarter, consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point reduction compared with the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects both lower pension expense as well as net sales growth which outpaced the increase in SG&A. We incurred net acquisition related expense to $1.7 million which reflects our estimated quarterly run rate related TXI going forward. As detailed on Slide 7, our consolidated earnings from operations were $119 million. This compares to $63 million in the prior quarter and represents an improvement of nearly 90%. With the full year we generated $382 million of operating cash flow compared with $309 million for 2013. Importantly though excluding payments for acquisition related expenses, adjusted operating cash flow was $452 million. This increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and less cash taxes partially offset by cash utilized for working capital. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2014, was slightly less than 2.5x in compliance with leverage covenant and in line with our target as of yearend. Our ability cash has provided us the opportunity to increase our return to shareholders in addition to the quarterly dividend. Consistent with this objective, this morning we announced a new share buyback program that includes authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. To provide context to this number, this represents nearly 30% of our outstanding shares as well as the number of shares issued on our July 1, 2014 acquisition of TXI. We expect to complete the program over three years. However, the actual timing would depend on available cash and the market price for our stock during the timeframe. Our balance sheet strength has allowed us to provide this return to our shareholders while also continuing to invest in our business responsibly.  Moving to our 2015 guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets both geographically particularly areas with strong employment gains and construction end use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies we expect growth in our three largest end use markets. The infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits, the residential market is expected to experience a double digit increase and the ChemRock/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. Geographically, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with a 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 4% to 6% over 2014. Aggregates product line cost per ton ship is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit.  We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%. Despite an $18 million increase heritage pension cost over 2014. On a consolidated basis we expect to generate earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA ranging from $825 million to $875 million. Interest should approximate $75 million to $80 million and the estimated effective income tax rate is expected to be 32% excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million which includes $35 million of synergy related capital and $80 million for continued development of the Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern highly efficient rail connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas including Houston for generations.  To conclude, we are grateful to our shareholders for their support throughout an exciting and transformational year. The TXI acquisition strengthened and broadens our foundation and we are well positioned to benefit from the growth demand for building materials and to continue delivering enhanced shareholder value. Additionally, for those of who you registered we look forward to seeing you at our Investor and Analysts Day this week on Thursday, February 12 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. With those of who you cannot attend, the event will be webcast and our website contains more details. Again thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. The operator will now give the required instructions. We will turn our attention to answering your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson: Thank you for taking my questions today. First couple questions are focused on TXI and in particular for the quarter, what was the switch between Q3 and Q4 in terms of realizing the upside from TXI synergies? And to that and what inning are we in terms of cost take- out for TXI? 
Ward Nye: Kathryn, thank you for question. I guess two components in that. Number one you have to remember when we went into the transaction and closed it on July 1, because of the anti-trust process, our operating teams had really only had about a couple of weeks with that business before we closed. So from a practical matter their time on the ground and their time looking for what we signed or we turn found synergies were really pretty short. So what's happen is as you are seeing really the result of having our teams in therefore in more expanded period of time. That's what really driven the acceleration of these synergies. So I am not that surprised by it. I knew if we could get our good people on the ground they would capture those and we would see them quickly and I do think they did a fantastic job with that. To the next part of question, where we are in the innings. I think we are in the early innings of this game. I mean again we've owned this business for a little bit over half year, you are seeing that type of synergy realization that quickly. You have to assume that we as a combined work force and that's what we are now. We will continue to work very effectively to find more and I think you should expect us to find more. 
Kathryn Thompson: One other follows up question on TXI. What were the -- could remind me the total aggregate volumes for calendar 2014 and what is TXI earnings contributing to 2015 in terms of the guidance you outlined today? 
Ward Nye: I can give you exactly what they were for the -- we are looking at 3.5 million tons of TXI really for the quarter and that's stone side we are looking about 1.3 on the cement side for the quarter casually again. The full year, we had never gone back and talked about that but we have given good guidance on that going forward. 
Kathryn Thompson: Okay, perfect. In terms of the volumes related to energy, in the past you'd it was roughly 7 million tons related to the energy industry are region specifically impacted by that. How much of the volumes two tiers one, what do you think now in terms of trends you alluded to that in your prepared commentary and then the second half is how much of this volumes are more related to directly to the energy industry so for instance building out a pad versus in the other type of construction projects which might be, for instance, building on road in a region that would be building road anyway but happens to be in the oil patch?
Ward Nye: Understood. Here what we saw energy in the fourth quarter, give you sense, we saw fourth quarter sale volumes about 1.7 million tons that was down about 350,000 tons for the quarter. We saw pull back in the Eagle Ford oddly enough or maybe not oddly enough, we saw Haynesville will actually up so what you are seeing is a little bit of play on gas versus gas and oil, Kathryn. If you go back and look at full year is around 7.5 million tons, you just been dead on that, most of that is going to either roads or pass or otherwise but here is the take that we have on it. What are seeing is a strong enough recovery in other areas of nonres that we think that's going to offset whatever bumps there maybe in some elements of the products simply going to the different shale place. So from where we are sitting, the shale play has always been in nonres all by itself. We are just seeing other portions of it. They are growing so rapidly. We think it is likely to offset that. But the other piece of it Kathryn now I that think it is important is the way energy has been moving particularly in the state like Texas to put some metrics to it. We used -- I want to say 17 million gallons of diesel fuel in the South West last year, so as we are watching oil prices come down, can it affect some degree of volume going to shale fields? The answer is yes. Do I think it is going to be horribly dramatic? The answer to that is no. Do I think the cost benefit that we will likely to see from that is much better than the downside on the volume? The answer to that is absolutely. 
Kathryn Thompson: And last question. Touching on lower diesel, what was the benefit in the quarter if you can quantify that? 
Ward Nye: Kathryn, it was round $4 million for the quarter. To give you a sense of what run rate is looking like in Q3 we burned about 11.5 million gallons of diesel fuel. In Q4 about 10.4 and that goes back to heritage numbers. Q1 we were 6.4 and Q2 we were 8.5. So we are looking at a run rate for this combined Martin Marietta at our TXI business, we are probably in that 40 to 44 million gallons of diesel per year. That's not a bad way to think about it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tray Groom with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Tray Groom: Hey, good afternoon, Ward Nye. I am doing well, how about yourself? Good, so just kind of follow up on that, on the last question about energy. So if you look at your Texas business overall, what is the mix -- is the mix of Texas any different than the mix that you have for your overall company that outlined here?
Ward Nye: No. It is not dramatically different. And the one thing that I would say that I think we need to think about is they have got a record letting program in Texas this year tries to the simple fact is if you look at a record infrastructure letting program this year close to $10 billion. And then doesn't include lot of the P3 work that's going on in that state. From an infrastructure perspective it is simply getting larger and keep in mind even the energy cargo road work that started last year about $150 million worth of that work was let but Texas I'd tell you they got $1 billion issue, they are all by themselves, so my point is thus more and more of that work probably for the next two, three years at least in Texas will tend to be infrastructure driven simply because that market is so immense right now. 
Tray Groom: And so the comment that you made about seeing some areas of nonres, seeing them those areas grow rapidly in your expectations for those to offset any slowdown you would see in the energy related demand. Can you talk more specifically about your -- what are you seeing, where are you seeing those that rapid improvement? 
Ward Nye: Here is a quick way to think of it. It continues in some respect to be highly concentrated in Texas because if you are looking at nonresidential start, so these are projects that aren't completed, these are projects that are underway and starting. The change from 2013 to 2014 was nearly $17 billion. So you just got an enormous amount of activity in that market place that's moving in that fashion. At the same time when we come back and take a look at more traditional commercial. In other words what's going on in office? What's going on in retail, what's going in shopping centers? What we are seeing right now Tray is considerably more work in that space and we've seen over the last several years. But you will remember we have seen a lot of heavy work in nonres over last two three years but not a lot on the lighter side of commercial, now we are starting to see that turn. But we are also starting to see that turn in other states is important to us. South Carolina, up 14%, Colorado up 17%, so again very good nonres activity across the board.
Tray Groom: Okay, thanks for that, Ward. And then shifting gears on the share repurchase program. Are you guys expecting to fund the majority of that or all of it or I guess how much of it with free cash flow versus -- are you thinking you may need to lever up some and bring on some debt to fund the buyback? 
Ward Nye: I will take the first part and let Anne come back and give some color to that. But our view is we can do this using our excess free cash flow. So we can go through this, we can take care of the requirements of the business. We can take care of the requirements of the dividend. And as we come down to that targeted range of between 2 and 2.5 and as you heard in my opening remarks, we are now below 2.5. As we get towards that 2 range, Tray, if our projections are right the free cash flow or excess free cash flow to this business is going to kick off, is pretty considerable. And I think that's something that we had a lot of conversation about it. But Anne you want to add some color to that. 
Anne Lloyd: Yes. I mean I think the free cash flow alone could fund the program. Our view however that is you can preserve your leverage as your acquisition firepower, we think today that our ton of leverage is $850 million that can do some pretty good M&A activity funding. So we would target that kind of two times leverage is all of our excess cash flow, similar to capital priorities are there. And preserve our firepower for financial flexibility. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois: Hi, thank you. And congratulation. First question I guess is the follow up to the free cash flow generation that you are expecting over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about the CapEx requirements that you anticipate over the next call two to three years? You identified a large project that you are putting into the budget for 2015. Does that go into 2016 and 2017 or how should we think about CapEx I guess when we are footing that against some pretty strong free cash flow potential? 
Ward Nye: Let's do this. Let me come back and talk about capital spending for this year, Anne will come back and talk a little bit more about CapEx in the out years. I mean if we are looking at $320 million for this year really the way that we are looking that's probably around 184 is an aggregate we are seeing probably around $40 million in cement, as I mentioned in my comments around $35 million on synergy, around $28 million in ready mix concrete and then of course we are buying land and otherwise. Back to your very specific question the Medina quarry project that we have outside of San Antonio, we are looking to put about $80 million into that this year. And we expect that project to be substantially complete this year. So we expect the term to switch and have that process very much underway as we go into 2016.
Anne Lloyd: And the total spends on that Medina project is about $150 million. So we've already acquired the property and done initial work there. As we look at 2016 and beyond from a capital allocation perspective, we could have placed holder in our forecasting of about $350 million annually for the combined business. If you can look back over the pattern of our capital spending, Garik, we generally are counter cyclical. When the markets are rising, recovery is rising, we generally are investing in Martin Marietta, expanding capacity, upgrading facilities. And then generally we do most of our M&A activity as the markets down. 
Ward Nye: Garik, one thing remember there -- as you remember when we are really spending at a maintenance level, at that point we are looking at DD&A numbers closer to 175 to 180 and we are looking at DD&A numbers today closer to 70 just to put some scope to that. 
Garik Shmois: Okay, thanks for the color. I guess switching to cement and cement pricing. You saw a nice sequential increase in the second quarter of ownership of the TXI assets. Just wondering if you can help parse out how much of the sequential price increase was just a low price to legacy projects rolling off so you had favorable project mix as opposed to organic price increases that we are putting in the market throughout the course of calendar 2014?
Ward Nye: Garik, it is tough to parse much of that I can tell you. Obviously the order projects are rolling up now with pretty quick rapidity. Obviously, we came in and put a $10 a ton increase in that market. And Texas is sold out market. And we are going to do more of same and we made that clear to our customers. And we are in very good places in that market place. So I would say the order prices are rolling off and what you are seeing going forward should be just true real sequential movement. 
Garik Shmois: Got it, thank you. And then my last question is respect to your cost guidance. You provided some of the sensitivities around diesel in your consumption. But unit cost guidance is for small decline, just wondering how much of the potential diesel benefits you do have embedded in your formal guidance for a cost in 2015? 
Anne Lloyd: Garik, we have included I would say about $20 million of embedded diesel improvement in our forecast and we actually -- you think about when we do our planning, we do our planning in the October timeframe, so we are going to use energy prices as of that time, so there has been obviously a rapid decline from that point in time to the end of 2014 but we've kept that diesel price in our plan with all but about $20 million of that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman & Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon. I am doing well, thanks. How are you? I am wondering if you could talk about which chemicals and LNG projects are within your target markets in Texas and maybe you could outline which of them are via truck versus rail, just help us understanding how you are positioned on those.
Ward Nye: I'd tell you what; I don't want to talk specific project by project. What I can tell you is if we are looking in South Texas, there are four major energy projects, is one major DOT project and if I just look at those all by themselves I can see the prospect of 2.5 million tons of aggregates on those. If we look at Houston, I can see a 11 different projects there with well over 2 million tons required, Houston road project separate and distinct from those other private projects, six major road projects over 4 million tons on those. And then back to the conversation we were having around infrastructure and specifically what's going on in North Texas. We are looking at projects in Dallas and Fort Worth in North Texas; they will call for almost 9 million tons of aggregates. So these are big projects all over the state, big tonnage and it makes us feel awfully good about where we are. 
Jerry Revich: And how long are the infrastructure projects I guess we are hearing from some of the REITs around Texas that new activity for them in 2016 will slow and I am wondering do you have enough visibility on the public side to really drive growth into 2016 or for 2016 at least based on what you see even if the private side slows? 
Ward Nye: All right. If I am looking on I-65 and 69 in Houston just starting to supply the project on US- 290 in Houston just starting to supply the project on state highway 288 in Houston, we are just starting to take bids on the Grand Parkway on another leg of it will be coming out again in May. So a lot of these projects, Jerry that I am talking about are projects that have multiple years ahead of them. And they are just starting. So I am not really speaking to jobs that I feel like to be going away in near terms. These are jobs that have likes to them. 
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then I am wondering if you could just talk about the pricing actions in cement and aggregates, and I believe you are planning a significant increase in January 1 for aggregates in Texas and then maybe you can comment on when --did you notify customers about next price increase in Texas, cement I think the general market expectation is for another round of increase around margin, I am wondering is that consistent with your schedule. 
Ward Nye: I mean that's the conversation we certainly going to having with customers. Again going back to the conversation we had a minute ago, these are markets they are in large part sold out. And DFW in particular to market that showed on sand and market that's long on really big projects. So we will certainly continue to push price along in these markets simply because of where they are. And the effect that this would which we can supply them. 
Jerry Revich: And would you care to comment on the magnitude of that price increase in aggregate in cement? 
Ward Nye: Yes. In cement, we are looking another 10 bucks a ton in the Dallas and in Texas markets. And in aggregates in that market place, we came back at a mid year price increase and Dallas we worked last year, we are coming into this year, it is going to vary by product but you could be looking anywhere from on the low end of $0.50 a ton to a high end of close to a ton to a couple of bucks a ton.
Jerry Revich: And then in terms of just a path to get to full utilization in the Texas cement operation. I guess based on the bookings in hand, do you anticipate you will be at full production rate in 2015? Can you just give small color there please? 
Ward Nye: I think we will continue to drive full production rate. Here is what full production rate is going to look like for us, Jerry. We are looking to be at 7 million tons by 2017, so here is the way that I would think about it. We are going to look in 2015 to add probably 250,000 tons in Texas that should be about 200,000 tons at Hunter, and 50,000 at Midlothian, in 2016 looking to come back and add another 300,000 tons probably about 140 at Hunter,  , 160 at Midlothian and by 2017 looking to add another probably 250,000 tons in Texas. That's going to give you bridge to what we say is 7 in 2017.
Anne Lloyd: And Jerry this is a reminder. You don't just get those efficiencies at a drop of a hat. You have to work through them as you go through planned outages at the various plants and facilities.
Jerry Revich: Okay. And maybe you could just say a bit more on that last point just calibrate us on how we should think about seasonality and for the cement business 2015 versus 2014, you had a very good fourth quarter despite the maintenance work and you just help us understand which are the seasonally weaker versus stronger quarters in 2015 since the TXI reporting was a bit off schedule from yours? 
Ward Nye: It is really going to be more driven plans when the outages are. So if you look at total outages in 2014 we had about $30.5 million spent at the cement operations in 2014. I think you should expect similar cost call it little bit north of $31 million in 2015. So what we are looking at is in Q2 and Q4, we are probably looking at nature outages in Q1 and Q3, we are looking at smaller outages. So the way that I would say major outage defined that is something that's in the zip code of plus $4 million and small outage somewhere being between $1 million and $2 million. 
Anne Lloyd: Yes. If you look at in the $30 million number that we gave you for 2014 was obviously annualized. We didn't incur $30 million in the second half 2014. So the TXI business had $30 million at calendar 2014 outages expect $31 million in 2015.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes, SunTrust. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. You might address this in couple days at the Analysts Day but I was intrigued with your question of using cash flow to fund this repurchase program. If that something you are going to cover, I am not going to make you go over the numbers on the call, but generally how are you going to get there? I'm having a hard time with the math.
Anne Lloyd: Well, I mean I don't have your model in front of me but just based on our view of the cash flow projections of the business, you got to take into consideration the minimal cash taxes that we will be paying over the next two years. We believe that there will be sufficient excess free cash flow to generate the $1 billion to $2 billion over the next three years that we would need to execute against this repurchase. So we can talk more about detailed.
Ward Nye: Keith, remember the other piece of that as well. We did identify excess properties at TXI. 
Anne Lloyd: Good point.
Ward Nye: And as we come through and sold those excess properties too that will play into this. 
Keith Hughes: Okay. Do you have an estimate amount what those are going to be?
Ward Nye: We talked about them at the time of transaction that would be $100 million plus minus.
Keith Hughes: So that as a change, you give as change. 
Ward Nye: Correct. 
Keith Hughes: Okay. Second question when you got some very bullish nonresidential discussion here we talk about one about Gulf Coast and Texas construction, is there any other areas in nonresidential that you feel be improving in 2015 versus what it is on 2014? 
Ward Nye: I think what we are seeing is we are seeing across the enterprise now Keith because what's happened and you have seen it too in Atlanta and other markets, that's going to tend to follow housing with a lag. And in markets that you are seeing good employment dynamics and now you got North Carolina and Georgia and Florida all with good employment dynamics, all with much better housing dynamics and now what we are seeing is we are seeing the change on nonres moving in those states exactly as we would have anticipated. So we continue to see strong momentum and growth in markets like Texas. Good momentum and growth in markets like Colorado, increasing momentum and better growth in markets like Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Ted Grace: Hi, it is Ted, congratulation on a very impressive quarter. I was hoping just talk about kind of the 2015 EBITDA guidance. So they really focused on the quarter aggregates business. Anne or Ward, can you just walk through kind of how you would encourage people to think about the flow through rate just for the aggregates business and maybe you help dimensionalize with diesel dynamics that will be -- from the standpoint of kind of when we normally think about call it 50% to 60% flow through rates for the core business ex pricing, and you said that over normalized, you never said that that's kind of target given here but could you just give us a little hand holding kind of either how people should be thinking about 2015 and to work the key variable that get you between 825 and 875, is that volume depended more than anything, is the synergy dependent more than anything just to the degree you can kind of flesh that out that will be great. 
Ward Nye: But the primary thing I think some of that is I think synergy certainly helps with that. I think the more powerful element of that really is when you are coming back and you are starting to see the Eastern United States perform a little better. I mean here is the way that you can think about it. We actually for the full year in the Mid - Atlantic division so less tonnage in 2014 than we sold in 2013. Now we are seeing then market get much stronger going into 2015, we made more money in Mid Atlantic on last tonnage in 2014 than we did 2013. So our point is simply this with that type of volume momentum now in those markets and with that type of performance in those markets, we feel like that could be awfully powerful to this business. And again what we are seeing particularly in North Texas around infrastructure, we think it is a great story. And again to your point, we are seeing lower occupancy rates in nonres than we've seen in Dallas in close to a decade right now. So when we look at what's going on sold out cement market, what we can do it pricing in that market but to your point what we can do in aggregates with synergies in TXI and an emerging strength in the South East and the Mid Atlantic group is performing more strongly, that's the key to it. That's the part of the country as you know Ted that has been the slowest to come out of this. And that's the part of the country that's the most disproportionately profitable for us particularly in heritage aggregates when it is performing in the more normalized way. 
Anne Lloyd: And if we look at the kind of booking of 825, 875, Ted, I mean obviously where our energy costs wanes for the course of the year, if energy costs were the same exactly as they were at the end of 2014 throughout the course of 2015, that 275 number pretty easily achievable. Pricing up or down one way or other and then really it back to Ward's point, it is improvement that we began to see in the back half of the year in that Southern lower right quartile of the United States. If that continues I think you can see a strong recovery in that EBITDA line. 
Ted Grace: Would you be willing to kind of state --
Anne Lloyd: But I will point, I would point out Ted if you don't mind, one of the challenges I believe that we are going to have as we move through the course of 2015 is the fact that our integration of TXI is progressing very smoothly to the point where it is becoming difficult to discern one operation from the other. 
Anne Lloyd: Which is the way it should be.
Anne Lloyd: Which is the way it should be. So parse now where those synergies are, they are there and you can see them in the results so whether they are coming from the fact that we are using a TXI Bridgeport Quarry or the Martin Marietta Chico Quarry, it is getting tougher and tougher to tell because these operations are becoming more and more seamless. 
Ted Grace: That makes sense. Would you be willing to plant a flag stake kind of like just to give us a mid point this is flow through rate on the aggregate business people should use? 
Anne Lloyd: No. 
Ted Grace: No, okay. Fair enough 
Anne Lloyd: I have got one Ted but that's your job.
Ted Grace: True, true. So my second question would be just following up on a couple others and then we are the second highest estimates on The Street and I understand and appreciate kind of the tax shield related to NOL but cumulatively we had you generating like $1 billion something cash over the next three years which based on your comments sounds too low, I know you talked about $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash but you are talking about kind of $135 of $2.7 billion of buyback. So I think that's what we are trying to struggle with that math, so I guess the question is are you actually implicitly telling us that the mid point, you said $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash is really more like $2.5 billion is what you are thinking of generating? If you can something organically or is that include cost of sales beyond the $100 million and I mean all granted you were to sell that or lever I guess that's what kind of I think people are trying to square up today is you are talking about find back $2.7 billion of stock at today's market price and we outlined is not free cash number that is even close to 2,000 so can you just talk about that little bit more to help us understand it. 
Anne Lloyd: Ted when we do our evaluation of $1 billion to $2 billion of share buyback, if you recall I mean this stock price came happened today so $133 mark got yesterday, right. So we look at $1 billion to $2 billion buyback that we thought could generate that cash flow and at the market price before today that very easily got 20 million shares, right. But obviously we will reassess and evaluate. We have said that it is excess free cash flow that we would generate from the business after organic capital and dividends; we will add back any proceeds from non strategic non operating asset sales through TXI. And that would be what we would deploy for share repurchases. 
Ted Grace: Okay, maybe I was really slow to that but just to be clear, when you are saying when you set the goal of $1 billion to $2 billion that back into like a million share count number to lower stock price. 
Anne Lloyd: I don't know how to answer your question, Ted. I am sorry. But as we look at the free cash flow available for the business that we thought we would generate it would be $1 billion to $2 billion. And that is -- what we have believe that we could allocate to share repurchases over the next two to three years. 
Ted Grace: Well, thanks, I think that's what we are trying to understand. So thank you for that clarity. Good luck. Looking forward to seeing you this week, guys 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with DA  Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well just back on the quarter the 12% increase from the infrastructure end market in Q4, was the majority of that from Texas or is it kind of evenly distributed among kind of Colorado, Florida and some other markets that you talked about. 
Ward Nye: It was relatively evenly distributed. I mean here is what we got. If you are looking in North Carolina, I mean we are seeing some good projects that are underway and some good projects that are coming. I mean in particular we are seeing some work coming up on Charlotte and work coming up in Greensboro, but again we saw better infrastructure work in North Carolina than we are seeing for a while. Georgia, remember as you well know the T plus program has put $1.8 billion over 10 years since South Georgia primarily, so now that's starting to pull through a degree. The Florida program as you referenced is really very, very strong. I mean it is the largest DOT budget in that state's history. One thing that's important about the state like Florida and I think it is a good model for the rest of the country, less than 30% of their DOT money actually originates from federal coffers which gives that nice staying power all the way through. And of course Colorado as we discussed has a good DOT program supplemented by their rep program, supplemented by a lot of FEMA spending in that marketplace right now. So you've got a series of markets in addition to what's going in Texas that have actually done quite well as you recall when we actually gave guidance last year the same time for 2014, we anticipated that infrastructure would be up and I think really a lot of people has some skepticism about it at the time and we said, where you are really matters on this DOT programs, and that's exactly what happen in 2014, that's what we think is going to happen in 2015 as well. 
Brent Thielman: And on that, so can we look at your kind of mid single digit assumption for infrastructure for 2015 is kind of a base level and then depending on some of these larger projects there maybe upside or timing of these large projects? 
Ward Nye: I think depending on the time of these large projects I think that is probably the case. And the other thing that I would tell you is that we can come through with a multiyear highway bill. I think in some respect that could change everything. Remember, we've been doing this in many respects moving hand to mouth on a DOT program for the better part of a decade. We haven't had a clear run on multiyear bill, and if we get a multiyear bill then I think you are clearly looking at something that we put out that's very, very safe number. And it would likely be popped up and part of what I am encouraged by is right now for you got members of the tea party like Rand Paul looking hard to find way to put a multiyear bill out there, I think that gives us a pretty good sense of where the year maybe going. 
Brent Thielman: Sure, that's interesting. If I just annualize kind of the cement gross profit business this last quarter, I mean you are kind nearing the low end of your 2015 guidance for that segment already. And clearly had some positive near term drivers in front of you for that business. I just wanted to be sure there isn't any sort of unusual expenses or other things we should consider as we are thinking about that for 2015?
Anne Lloyd: Hi, Brent, as you analyzed that you need to consider the fact that in that quarter there were about $10 million of outage cost that would only replicate likely in two of the four quarter in 2015. 
Brent Thielman: Okay 
Anne Lloyd: And that was back to the comment that I gave for Jerry and that was really if you are looking -- you should expect old and summer costs on outages but in 2015 you should look forward Q4 and Q2 to have some major outages in Q1 and Q3 to have smaller outages. Does that help? 
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities 
Craig Bibb: Good to be with you on the phone. Could you -- your estimate of Texas industry synergy is now 40% above your initial estimate. Can you able to breakdown the $100 million in savings you expect now? 
Ward Nye: I think the primary things that are happening SG&A numbers haven't changed. What's gotten more robust procurement is gotten more robust, operation is gotten more robust. So those primary areas that you would imagine. If you would think about in these terms the two big quarries that we picked up, the Bridgeport that is literally next door to our Chico operation. And their Mill Creek operation and cleverly our Mill Creek operation delivering next door to each other. Those now operates a single quarry and the efficiencies that we are getting from that operationally and otherwise are very significant in addition to procurement. So basically the markers that we put down on SG&A and otherwise that we knew we would be getting, they done exactly as we would have thought, the operation side of it has come through better, is come through faster. 
Craig Bibb: The planned buyback sizable, you gave in -- given some guidance in terms of maintaining your debt to EBITDA, but you are buying back a lot of stock. Do you have a goals kind of across the three years of the planned buyback, are you think in terms of 2% a quarter or any broad strokes of --where you would like to climb up -- 
Ward Nye: We will give you a good readout of it on a quarter by quarter basis. A lot of it is going to depend on how the end line business is performing. A lot of it is going to depend on what opportunities are out there as well because the primary thing that we want to make sure we do is create value and buying share back creates value. Doing the right transaction creates value as well. So it may not be a perfectly linear buyback you should expect it to be. But we will come back and we will tell you quarterly what it looks like.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for any closing remarks. 
Ward Nye: Again thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. We remain committed to what we like to call our pillars of shareholder value, world class safety, ethical conduct, sustainability, operational excellence, and cost discipline and customer satisfaction. We look forward to discussing these and other highlights with you in our first quarter results in April. See you then. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead sir.
Ward Nye - Chairman and CEO: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta’s quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The results we reported for the third quarter 2014 reflect the successful TXI acquisition and frankly underscores the value and timing of the transaction. Bringing TXI into Martin Marietta not only continues to enhance our overall presence in the Western United States, but importantly augments our significant heritage position in Texas, which as you know, leads the nation in job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity. Texas is also operating with the robust department of transportation budget having embraced alternative financing with the vision and vigor unlike any other. Allowing the state to commit to numerous major multi-year projects that should benefit our business in 2015 and beyond. To give you some examples of the value of TXI, the acquired operations contributed $274 million of net sales, an increase of 53% and $44.5 million of adjusted gross profit to our third quarter results. And for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we generated $202 million of operating cash flow compared with $166 million for the prior year period. But what are the initial and clinical takeaways, we view them largely as four-fold. First, the acquired operations provide a powerful complement to our strong heritage business and has Martin Marietta ready to supply the increasing demand for building materials. Second, by our refinancing of TXI’s public debt, we’re now positioned to reduce legacy TXI’s annual interest expense by $34 million. Third, our original estimates of synergies of $70 million every three years now seeing too low and too slow. We anticipate doing considerably better. Finally, the $400 million of NOL carryforwards we originally estimated have increased by nearly $100 million. We’ll discuss the specifics of all of these value enhancing factors and more during this teleconference. Additionally, we’re also pleased to see increased demand in our heritage business during the third quarter resulting in 130 basis point expansion of our consolidated gross margin. This improvement was driven by volume and pricing growth in our aggregates product line, despite costs in various inefficiency headwinds from rail transportation. Further, the specialty products business contributed record third quarter net sales and earnings from operation. Before discussing the quarterly results further, as a reminder, today’s teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance like other businesses, which subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. As a preface, let me offer that it’s not easy to fully understand, calibrate and compare this quarter’s results with other periods due to the TXI acquisition as well as TXI related non-recurring items. Simple comparisons to prior periods for either Martin Marietta or legacy TXI will not provide an adequate understanding of a business that’s been transformed with a 53% increase in net sales. That said, we classified legacy TXI reporting to conform to Martin Marietta. As a result of the reclassification and the impact of business combination accounting, direct comparison to legacy TXI’s publicly available data from prior years does not reflect same-on-same performance results. In addition, because TXI’s fiscal year ended May 31 whereas ours in December 31, the reporting periods are not the same. Still we have provided reference to prior year legacy TXI data where relevant to the understanding of the underlying business. So on today’s call and in future presentations we’ll be making, we will endeavor to be as transparent as possible so you can more easily track and evaluate our progress. In our earnings release and in the charts made available, both during this webcast and on our website, we supplied supplemental financial information through the lens we used to analyze the business in light of the TXI acquisition. First, as detailed on slide two, our heritage Martin Marietta business which includes specialty products provides same on same comparison to the prior year third quarter; second, as detailed on slide four, our acquired operation including a view of performance in the acquired business’s product lines and finally, we provide an overview of TXI related and non-recurring items. We believe this approach provides meaningful data and makes the performance in our business more transparent for the quarter. Let’s begin with the look at our EPS. Consensus estimates vary considerably, as analysts attempted to predict the impact of the TXI acquisition on quarterly results. Based on Wall Street’s estimates as reported by first call, we believe two key differences totaling $0.17 reconcile these estimates to reported EPS. First, analysts assumed weighted average outstanding shares of 62.6 million versus a reported 67.5 million. This alone reduced EPS by $0.07. The 67.5 million shares include shares issued in the acquisition as well as the impact of conversion of TXI stock-based awards. Second, business combination accounting rules dictated a fair value markup of acquired aggregates and cement inventory effectively eliminating nearly $11 million of profit in inventory sold during the third quarter, a $0.10 per share negative impact on EPS. Next, let’s review our heritage Martin Marietta business. Slide 3 provides you key metrics for our heritage operation. Our aggregates business continues to improve led by robust activity in our West Group primarily in Texas and Colorado. Aggregates product line shipments in the West Group increased more than 5%. Notably aggregates volumes in the West Group would have increased 9% over the prior year quarter if the required TXI-related divestiture had been included for the full three month period. The Midwest and Eastern part of the country was negatively affected by unseasonably wet weather during the quarter. Notwithstanding this short-term impact, we are seeing signs of increased South Eastern construction activity led by job growth in Atlanta, Georgia and Florida, as well as TIFIA-supported infrastructure projects. Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in our three largest end use markets. The infrastructure market represented 47% of quarterly volumes and shipments to the sector increased 3%. Public-sector work in Texas includes the benefits of nearly $20 billion of construction investment from 2013 through 2015. We recently began serving the interstate 35 East project in Dallas and are positioned to serve upcoming sections of the TIFIA funded Grand Parkway project in Houston. The East and other major projects have contributed to a multi-year backlog in Texas. Colorado is also experiencing growth driven by the responsible acceleration of maintenance and partnerships or RAMP program, as well as reconstruction work resulting from last year’s flooding. For the quarter, infrastructure shipments in Colorado were up more than 20% over the prior year period. During the quarter, Congress passed an extension of MAP-21 through May 31, 2015 and also authorized $11 billion of transfers to maintain the High Way Trust Fund solvency. We believe these are the first steps toward reauthorization of a multi-year federal highway bill. The non-residential end-use market represented 30% of quarterly heritage volume since shipments increased 3% over the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by shipments to support shale energy expansion projects notably in South Texas. Recently, there have been market concerns about the sustainability of these projects primarily due to the decline in the global price of oil. However, there are over $100 billion of anticipated energy projects along the Gulf Coast and over $1 billion of needed infrastructure repairs on roads damaged by heavy construction vehicles used in energy projects over the past several years. Early portion of this repair work are now underway. Given this level of ongoing activity, we expect the ramping up in construction materials demand for these projects. Consistent with that expectation, on the November 2014 ballet, the Texas legislature has advanced Proposition 1. Our proposed constitutional amendment who directs needed road repairs. If approved by the voters, Proposition 1 would authorize annual disbursements from the state’s existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund, an estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred in the first year alone. Current polling data indicates Proposition 1 is expected to pass in next week’s elections. The residential end-use market represented 14% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and shipments increased 9% over the prior year quarter. We experienced significant residential construction growth in our western markets in direct contrast to national trends. By way of example, for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2014, residential starts were up 31% in San Antonio, 11% in both Houston and Austin and 27% in Fort Collins, Colorado along the front range north of Denver. This reaffirms our view for the value of the company’s strategic growth initiatives made over the past several years which should continue to benefit our future demand. Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets. The ChemRock and Rail market representing the remaining 9% of our heritage aggregate product line volume and shipments declined 9% versus the prior year quarter. The performance of Class 1 railroads both in terms of capital maintenance and operational efficiency has led to continued weakness in balanced sales and is the primary driver for the decrease in shipments. Heritage aggregates product line pricing remained strong and we were pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Prices increased 5% over the prior year quarter led by an 8% increase in the West Group. Product mix did not have a material impact on the quarterly pricing comparison. Aggregates’ product line production increased 4% response to higher demand. However, direct production cost per ton increased slightly as greater leverage was offset by higher repair and supply costs and the productivity impact of certain weather constraints. Cost of sales was also negatively affected by higher transportation costs related to our long-haul distribution network, principally rail inefficiencies. We estimate that these increased third quarter costs to be over $12.7 million, a cost headwind likely to continue in the fourth quarter. However, energy costs, which were essentially flat during the quarter should mitigate ongoing production costs as the effect of declining diesel fuel prices work through the business. The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines provided an enhanced quarterly contribution. The ready mixed concrete product line experienced volume and pricing increases of 17% and 14% respectively which led to an 840 basis-point increase in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported 13% increase in net sales. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased 16% to over $142 million, yielding a gross margin percentage to net sales of 24.3%, an improvement of 170 basis points from the prior year quarter. The incremental contribution from each dollar of net sales would have been in line with stated expectations excluding the impact of higher rail transportation costs. Our Specialty Products business again posted strong quarterly results, delivering record net sales of $58.7 million and the gross margin of 34%. The business contributed earnings from operations of $17.7 million also a third quarter record. The first 90 days post TXI acquisition have been both busy and invigorating. Our aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations teams have worked diligently on integration into the existing West Group structure. Specifically, we completed the back office integration of the aggregates business, including closing our former district conference in Lewisville, Texas as well as moving to Southwest division’s leadership team from San Antonio. Both groups have relocated to TXI’s former Dallas headquarters. Simultaneously, our cement group team also based in our Dallas office has been refining the sales and operational strategies of that business. We plan to complete systems integration for the cement and ready mixed concrete businesses no later than June 2015. Accordingly and as planned, certain deflective corporate overhead costs will continue through that time. We’re pleased with the progress to-date and are especially proud of the response from the combined workforce as we forward to new unified accountability and performance culture on every front. Leading the safety through operational and profitability expectations. Our team is energized and enthusiastic about solidifying the foundation for future growth and shareholder return. A key area of focus is increasing and accelerating the synergistic value of the acquisition. When we announced our planned acquisition of TXI, we said that we expected annual synergies of $70 million by 2017. We were conservative in our estimates. As our integration efforts progressed, we now expect synergies will be higher and the benefits will occur sooner than originally expected. Over the next few years, we also fully anticipate utilizing the income tax benefits from legacy TXI’s, net operating loss carry-forwards as well as incremental value from the expected divestiture of identifying non-operating real estate asset. After completing initial estimates of legacy TXI’s fiscal year 2014 tax provision, the NOLs now exceed $500 million, also the completed refinancing of legacy TXI’s outstanding debt is expected to reduce annual interest expense by $34 million based on current interest rates. This amount is incremental to the previously stated synergy target. Slides four and five provides you financial information and key metrics for our required operations. The acquired aggregates business reported net sales of nearly $37 million on shipments of 3.2 million tons. Average selling price was $11.83 per ton driven by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments. After adjustment for the non-recurring impact of the mark-up of inventory to fair value during the quarter, the acquired aggregates business generated $8 million of gross profit, a 21% adjusted gross margin. Performance in the aggregates business should improved at an accelerated pace given the strength of the underlying market demand coupled with synergy expectations. The acquired ready mix concrete business shipped 1.5 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.10. When compared to the legacy TXI quarter ended August 31, 2013, shipments increased 20% and pricing when adjusted for comparable legacy TXI presentation increased 4.5%. The business contributed nearly $10 million of gross profit. A $6 per cubic yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1st. The full realization of this increase will likely take six months as we work through the current backlog. As a reminder, we acquired a leading position in the Texas cement markets and a state-of-the-art rail-located cement plant in Southern California. These plants produced Portland and Specialty Cements with a combined annual capacity of 6.6 million tons, as well as the current permit that provides an 800,000 ton expansion opportunity at Midlothian plant near DSW. As discussed earlier, the economic climate in Texas has moved beyond recovery into an expansion phase in infrastructure, non-residential and residential construction. As such, Texas cement demand currently exceeds available local supply, a trend that’s expected to continue for the near future. In the third quarter, we shipped 1.525 million tons of cement. Volumes were 16% higher than 2013 when compared with legacy TXI’s publicly disclosed data for the three months ended August 31, 2013 a period higher to our ownership of these assets and reflecting a quarter based on TXI’s fiscal year ended May 31 versus our fiscal year ended December 31. Cement pricing of $85.95 per ton is $6.52 or 8.2% higher than legacy TXI prices reported for the three months ended August 31, 2013. For the third quarter, the cement business contributed $110 million of net sales and generated nearly $28 million in adjusted gross profit, yielding an adjusted margin of 25%. The adjusted gross profit excludes the non-recurring impact of a required markup of inventory to fair value. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating in the low 70% utilization reflective of a slower recovery in the Southern California construction economy. We anticipate California markets should reach the demand supply equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready-mixed concrete teams developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiency, as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency providing incremental supply for a sold out Texas cement market and a roadmap with significantly improve profitability for 2015 and beyond. Further, on October 1, 2014, we announced the $10 per ton price increase for both the Texas and California market. Our results for the quarter also underscore the continuing discipline we bring to managing our business. Consolidated SG&A was 5.3% of net sales and 90 basis point reduction compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement reflects transaction synergies, lower pension expense and the absence of information systems upgrade costs incurred in 2013, but does not reflect non-recurring transaction costs. We incurred net acquisition expenses of $26.1 million which includes transaction and integration costs and a gain on the required divestiture of assets. As detailed on slide 6, our adjusted consolidated earnings from operations, which excludes the cost related to the markup of acquired inventory, as well as net acquisition-related expenses was $153 million. This compares to $109 million in the prior year quarter and represents improvement of more than 40%. On a year-to-date basis we generated $202 million of operating cash flow compared with $166 million for the prior year period. This increase is primarily due to earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense coupled with cash flow generated from working capital, all in relation to the prior year. Further, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2014 was 2.91 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant. As to full year 2014 guidance, we expect continued growth in our markets particularly in areas with strong employment gains and reaffirm our guidance for heritage aggregates product line shipments to increase 6% to 8% and product line pricing to be up 3% to 5%. Heritage aggregates product line direct production cost per ton is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2013. And lastly we expect the TXI acquisition to essentially breakeven to earnings per diluted share excluding non-recurring cost and corporate overhead allocations. We have now completed our initial planning for 2015 and are in the process of formulating our definitive guidance which we’ll provide to you in our year-end earnings release. Broadly speaking, we continue to see our end-use markets growing albeit at varying degrees depending on geography. Importantly, the Eastern United States continues to recover year-over-year. Meanwhile economic expansion in the Western United States will continue to outpace recovery in the east and force the acquire TXI business will contribute significant incremental growth in 2015 driven impart by the realization of a full year of operations coupled with continued synergy realization and operational improvement. In Martin Marietta geographies, the infrastructure market is expected to increase mid single-digits. Non-residential construction should increase in high single-digits. The residential markets should experience a double-digit increase. And ChemRock and Rail should remain relatively flat. Our company’s outlook for the cement industry is largely consistent with PCA’s forecast and should increase in the high single-digits. To conclude, we’re grateful to our shareholders for their support of the TXI acquisition. We are already benefiting from this transformational transaction and the growing demand for building materials. Job growth should continue to serve as a catalyst for construction activity, and provide opportunities for us to increase earnings and create additional shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we’ll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: Certainly. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your question please.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Good afternoon, Ward and Anne. Could you expand, you gave us some detail about the heritage aggregates business, but could you expand a little bit more about the balance of 2014 and into 2015 by geographies of where you seeing particular strength or weakness and maybe highlight your outlook for the various end markets, because I know you do it bottoms up for various geographies?
Ward Nye: Sure Arnie, thank you for your question. As we look at top side Arnie, the west will continue to outperform, but we’re seeing both in Texas and Colorado is pretty exciting and we see that’s being very strong for the balance of this year, and we see that’s being very strong into next year. I think part of what we discussed in the earnings release and in the telecom is infrastructure work as well as non-res and res in Texas is all very, very attractive right now, same story is true in Colorado. The fact is all of those are getting better in the Eastern United States, but it’s lumpier and it’s a little bit slower. So for example in the quarter, we saw volumes nicely up in parts of North Carolina. So Charlotte was better quarter-over-quarter, but here is the lumpiness of it, Greensboro and Raleigh were actually modestly down. Now, I do think weather has something to do with that. And I think timing of some infrastructure work has something to do with that. But as you’re aware, when we have that type of group in North Carolina, we discussed for years that we feel that rather disproportionately. So as we look at the business Arnie, it’s progressing in the recovery phase how I would have thought. Part of what I was pleased with as I looked at quarter is really that the component of the quarter that I think was clearly unplanned is the cost that we incurred relative to rail freight. So, as we pause and step back from that and look at it, rail freight all by itself was somewhere probably $8.5 million to $9 million worth of cost for the quarter. And the reason that I call that out in particular, maintenance repairs is a cost that’s going to ebb and flow depending on what’s happening with volume. But what happened with rail is extraordinary. And for the quarter coming back to your question, if we pull that extraordinary cost out, what I like about the quarter is we were seeing incrementals in our heritage business very much in line with what we’ve been anticipating. So I hope that’s responsive to your question.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: That’s great. And there’s an obvious second question for me if you don’t mind. On the synergies, you mentioned 70 million over three years and in your prepared remarks you said greater and sooner and used a term considerably better. So, I guess it’s fair to ask can you try to quantify what the savings you hope to get are and the timing?
Ward Nye: Let’s think of it then in this term Arnie. So, we talked originally about basically $70 million of operational synergies and let’s call it $34 million of interest rate synergies that gives you $100 million all by itself. Coming back and just speaking to the targeted synergies that we spoke of $70 million that we thought we would have at the end of 2017, based on what I’m seeing right now, I think we’ll likely have $70 million probably by midyear ‘16. So we’re going to capture if at least 18 months in advance. And as I look at what’s going on what I like about that is that’s really going on primarily within what we’re pulling out in the operations. And keep in mind we’ve got quarrying that are littering next door to each other, the fewer operational efficiencies that we’re seeing in the transaction are going nicely ahead of where they thought -- where we thought they would be. And I think what we said is right. Our original estimates for too low and too slow, they’re going to be higher, they’re going to be faster, I think we’ll hit that 70, 18 months of it.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Arnie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your question please?
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. In the 8-K you filed in the quarter was helpful and gave us some sense of the magnitude of contribution of divested asset related to the TXI transaction. For the quarter end what was the revenue and gross profit contribution impact of those divested assets and also tagging that you a little bit earlier with the freight impact in quarter, have you taken a stab at what contribution margins would have been with the clean year-over-year cost taking to account those divested asset? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Let me look at this right, Kathryn. If we look at the divested assets, if I look at the tonnage that came out for the quarter, it’s probably around 570 some thousand tons for the quarter. So that’s probably a good way for you to go back and really sort out what that means. I think the second part of your question I think it really goes back to what we were talking about before, if we’re simply looking at the change in cost quarter-over-quarter, the rail freight and the adjustment there is the primary driver on where we’re seeing the difference. And again, if that’s $9 million, if you take that $9 million bring it back into the adjusted gross margin of 162 and then go back and at least work with call it 575,000 tons that work historically coming out of North Troy. I think that gives you your bridge.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Okay, great. Thank you. Looking at some of the certain regions in the Southeast, particularly more call it a passionate certain markets, Alabama which received feedback not only from our base and material contracts, but also our building product distributor. So, completely different construction end market. What has been the feedback or the driver of just tapping at the pedal and then in certain markets. In other words is it a more end market focus, weather driven or is there something else we should take in consideration. And what do you see on [Touchstone]?
Ward Nye: As far as what you’re seeing in Alabama and the entities in South, is that your question, Kathryn?
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Yes, it is.
Ward Nye: Okay. I think the primary issue that we are seeing there and principally more in part of a quarter, remember we are not all things to all people in Florida. We’re really infrastructure play in Florida and our positions in Alabama are really more headed toward Birmingham and heading South as well. I think what we’re seeing particularly in Florida is we have a timing issue and the timing issue is relative to larger projects. So, we know for example the I-4 Ultimate work is going to began in 2015. That’s going to be significant work for multi-years inside of a record Florida DOT program. So, we’re looking at that portion of the Southeast. We think it’s more of a timing issue. Part of what I was particularly hard to see though is we do continue to see a nice recovery in North Georgia. And as you recall, we’ve changed our footprint in that Atlanta market pretty considerably over the last five or six years and have a very attractive number two position in Atlanta today, which is very different from number four and number five position we would have there 6 or 7 years ago. So, what I would say direct response is we think Florida is a timing issue for us on infrastructure and we think North Georgia continues to recover.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Great. You described that a little bit in your prepared comments, but have you seen any change in pace of orders or change in conversations and energy beverage regions and response to the decline in lower pricing?
Ward Nye: We have not. And the simple fact is if we go and take a look at what’s going on in shale with our business, I can say our shale-related tonnage. And again this is in frac material, this is what’s going to road it’s going to [pads] et cetera was up 424,000 tons for third quarter last year to third quarter last year. My guess is at the end of this year, we’re going to see tonnage going to those different shale plays of an access of $7 million tons. Now but I would remind you, obviously I think most people last year thought it probably peaked up and if we’re right this year is going to be higher than last year was. Here is what we’re seeing and the different place Niobrara is better, Marcellus is better, Eagle Ford is better, Haynesville is better and Barnett is off. Now that’s really the way that stacks up right now, Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Okay. thank you. Then my final question today, just to clarify what you had certain specific comments regarding interest expense. Is interest expense reported in Q3 a good run rate going forward or there will be additional decline on quarterly run rate going forward?
Anne Lloyd: Kathryn I think the interest rate in the third quarter is a pretty solid run rate.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Great. Thank you so much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak from BB&T. Your question please.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.
Ward Nye: Hey Jack.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: With regard to the rail congestion and the increased cost there, isn’t it likely to persist at least for a little while longer?
Ward Nye: I think it is and I said it much in our prepared remarks. I think several things are affecting Class 1 railroads. I think a lot of them came out of a very difficult winter behind April. I think they have had a lot of traffic this year in March driven by what’s going on their rails. I think some of their infrastructure needs some work right now. I mean we’re certainly seeing evidence of that. So I do think that continues to go on. I think part of the evidence of it is, Class 1 railroads this year by my data will use about 20% less ballast in 2014 than they did in 2013 and our ballast shipments are down a little bit less than that year-over-year. It’s not the lack of need that they are taking that ballast. They’ve got that much activity on the ballast. Now, here is the quick response to it as well, Jack. And I think the way that we’ll likely respond to that is twofold. One we have the ability to run distributed power and bring more cars into our yards and make up for inefficiency by share volume coming through. And candidly the other component of it is transportation is going to be tight for everyone by both rail and by truck and that’s likely to end up being a price point. And I think if we continue to see that type of headwind, I think we’re going to come back and we’re going to adjust prices accordingly.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: Got you. Thanks for the color. Let me ask about corporate overhead in the quarter which I think you are even take out the acquisition cost that you reported is up substantially in the high 50 million versus a little less than 6 million in the same period last year. Obviously you have TXI later in there and you told us not to compare legacy TXI numbers but to my point of reference, we have and it seems like an outsized increase even after adjusting for the acquisition cost taking them out, is there something else in there or how should we think about the corporate line going forward?
Anne Lloyd: We look at corporate overhead and Jack, I want to make sure I am following you where you are. I mean we look at total SG&A cost to $48 million versus $37 million last year. The corporate pieces principally have all the acquisition related cost in them. And then if you look at TXI as a whole, so if you look at the acquired operations, we picked up about, rounding about $16 million of SG&A from the acquired businesses. Included in that $16 million is about $4.5 million of basically overhead we allocated here from the corporate office, there was some unallocated overhead that remained that we allocated to that business, there is about $6 million of what I’ll call duplicative overhead and that is the remaining SG&A really left as we continue to integrate the ready mixed concrete and the cement businesses which is most commonly indicated, we are expecting to be done by June of next year, so that cost to begin to work its way out of the system. So as we look at the pure SG&A that we picked up from TXI, I think we picked up around $5 million of SG&A on a go forward basis against their corporate run rate in the third quarter or quarter ended August 31st of about $18.5 million. So that’s where we’re looking at. If you’ve got some other specific questions, maybe we can uncap that offline.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: That’s helpful to go directionally, thank you. And the diesel fuel, can you tell us the price change in the maybe for the heritage operations if you have that versus last year?
Ward Nye: I’ll tell you what I’ve got. I’ve got 309 in Q3 versus 322 last year in the same quarter. So, we’re seeing a nice decline. And obviously what we’ve got is about two weeks worth of storage at facilities. So, if that helps, I’m going to stay a little bit for Q3; if it continues like that, it really is going to be much more of a player in Q4 than it was in three.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: Yes, very good. Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: All right. Thank you Jack.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please?
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: So, a follow-up question to the last one with respect to diesel costs and your expectation that it should offset the higher anticipated rail congestion expenses. Just wondering if you could maybe provide some clarification. Are you expecting that the lower diesel is going to fully offset or just be a partial offset moving forward?
Ward Nye: Hi Garik. I think it will be a partial offset; I don’t -- I think the word I used was mitigate, not offset. So, I think it will make it easier going forward, but I don’t think it makes up a whole.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. And with respect to cement price increases that you have mentioned for October in both of your states, can you provide maybe a little bit more color on how those are sticking at this point?
Ward Nye: Yes, I can Garik. I mean we don’t see any retraction on those at all. I mean we went into both Texas and California resolute that we needed to have those, I don’t think we like we particularly needed to have that in California. Our intention is to make that plant profitable and that’s exactly what we intend to do and the other thing that we intend to do is come back with a very similar looking increase in 2015 as well.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks. And then just a question for Anne. Just under tax guidance of 39% for the full year, quite a big step-up obviously in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about the tax rate looking forward?
Anne Lloyd: The tax rate is paid down and track down all of the really TXI-related costs that were non-deductible including the goodwill that we wrote-off for the divested assets sort of the change in control costs that were not allowed tax deductibility and some of the transaction costs that were tax deductible. If you strip all of that out, the ongoing tax rate for the core business including TXI is 29%, which is really where our guidance thought it would be. If you recall back in the second quarter, we indicated we probably have a 29% tax rate excluding this figure there. All of these TXI issues are what drove the tax rate to that from the 29% to 39%. So, I expect it to continue to be 39% for the fourth quarter because it’s just (inaudible) the run rate is 29%.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess just my last question on the TXI accretion guidance for this year is expected to be flat. Correct me if I’m wrong, it’s not previously when you had announced the deal you had anticipated accretion to earnings for this year and for year one closing somewhere along lies in mid-to-high-teens accretion. Just wondering, if you could speak to the change, is it just a timing issue around the closing and if you are still contemplating the year one accretion levels that you previously outlined?
Ward Nye: Thanks for the question. I think we’re sticking with what we thought full year one would look like. I’m going to quote one of my colleagues who looked at this and said, this is all subject to the tyranny of purchase price accounting. And candidly, that’s exactly what we’re dealing with. When you look at the inventories and the other odd things that go through purchase price accounting, they are in [advisory] delta. I think we could end this year with this deal being accretive. I think it depends on what fourth quarter looks like. And I’m hopeful that that’s where it will be. But if we come back and really look at what the delta is, I would point you to purchase price accounting and what’s tied up in that.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks so much. Best of luck.
Ward Nye: Okay. Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. It’s Matt Ryback on behalf of Jerry. It sounds like you had some pockets of soft demand overall. Just wondering if you could talk about whether volumes improved in October and maybe say more about your confidence in the mid single-digit infrastructure growth next year?
Ward Nye:  I guess a couple of things on that. We’ll tell you more about Q4 when we’re together in February, but here is what I’ve always said about October. It should be the busiest month that the aggregates industry in this country sees. And if you’ve got good weather, you would have to work reasonably well. And what I’ll tell you is I’m not sure what it’s doing for you, but it’s sunny and clear in Raleigh today. So, but I’ll talk more about October when we get together in February. As we come back and address your question relative to infrastructure next year, here is what I would say on that as well. We’re showing infrastructure up, it’s all about where you are. And here is why we see infrastructure up. It’s going to be another good year in Colorado. It’s going to be another steady year in [Iowa]. It’s going to be another great year in Texas. I think we’ve got probably four years of great infrastructure work ahead of us in Texas. We’ve got Florida clearly getting better year-over-year with a record DOT program. And we’re seeing a good steady program right now in North Carolina. The Governor has come back, he’s laid out his 20 plus year vision of transportation here. It’s more urban focused than it’s been historically, but he is also looking at a considerable bonding program that could come back and have more rural initiatives as well. So when we come back and say Colorado feels better, Iowa feels fine, Texas feels better, Florida feels better and North Carolina feels steady, that gives us a good start. I think if we again more a Northeast or more Great Lakes focused I would probably have more concern, but if I look at where we are I feel good about infrastructure next year.
Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs: Great. And then just to follow-up on pricing, pricing has been well ahead of your guidance. Can you talk about what surprise to the upside and maybe why you’re not changing the pricing guidance range for the full year?
Ward Nye: Well, keep in mind, we had a lot of mixed issues and timing at the beginning of the year, so we thought we would see a make-up as we came through the year. I think part of what’s giving us some tailwind on that right now is we did see more midyear price increases this year than we’ve seen last year. As a remainder, we actually saw midyear price increase in Dallas Fort Worth market this year and that’s been a market for years that we did not see a midyear price increase. So again, I think the pricing is doing exactly what we thought the price would do and the volume recovery we always said there was going to be a lag there, but I feel good about it, feel good about as we look into ‘15.
Anne Lloyd: And also Matt, I would say that the fourth quarter pricing is very much affected by mix of agricultural line shipment and that will obviously be dependent on -- it’s very weather dependent as to whether that ag line goes down.
Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs: Perfect. Thank you very much Anne.
Ward Nye: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your question please?
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Hi thanks. Good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Good morning Trey.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Kind of back to the cost in the quarter, you pointed to the rail but also I think you said $8 million to $9 million in the quarter from congestion there, but you expect diesel should mitigate this. So just for clarity, so the impact in 4Q from this kind of net of diesel should be less than the $8 million to $9 million that you realized in 3Q, we think about that right?
Ward Nye: I think you’re thinking that right Trey. I mean I think directionally you are in the right place on that. I think the maintenance and repair spike that we’re seeing is not a surprise. We talked about last quarter, it’s not going to be something that goes in a quarter or two. But I think you will see that come back into a more normal place. But I do think if we have diesel down and we have a normal Q4, it will certainly start to mitigate some of the congestion and related issues that we’re seeing in rail.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. I’m sorry if I missed it, but the higher repaired supply cost, what was that in the quarter?
Ward Nye: It’s about $4 million.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. And then looking at your initial guidance range for ‘15 volume, I guess kind of the directional range for ‘15 volume. I appreciate you’ve given us kind of an insight into that a little early and you have made a few comments, but didn’t really get into a whole lot of detail about pricing. But just given the backdrop of volume, could you give us any directional sense or any color on how you think about pricing in that kind of demand environment?
Ward Nye: As you heard us say before Trey, I think pricing tends to follow volume up with the lag. And I think we clearly feel the benefit of increased midyear pricing this year, more next year. I think if we come back and take a look at where we particularly see strong economies and we have leadership positions in Texas and what we could do in Colorado. Keep in mind, even as we look at the quarter, we’re looking at price increases on a percentage basis in the west that are going up higher than they are in the east. So there is your volume and your price link. So, I think we’ll continue to see that. And obviously, we’ll give more definitive guidance on pricing when we come out in February with our full year results. And I’m sure we’ll talk about that at the Investor Day that we’re playing in February as well. But I think the pricing story continues to be a very different and very appropriate in this industry given the reserves that are incredibly valuable and hard to permit.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. Thanks for that Ward. And then you mentioned in October $10 price increase in cement. It sounds like that’s come along pretty well. But there is some announcement from some of your competition in those markets, California and Texas for price increases, substantial price increases as we look into 2015. What are your thoughts as we kind of look into those announcements? Have you guys put anything out in those markets for that timeframe or just general thoughts on increases on cement as we look into next year especially in the Texas and California market?
Ward Nye: I guess, this is when I would say Texas is sold out, I mean Texas is sold out. And I think when you’re operating in a sold out market, obviously you’re going to see pricing do what pricing will do in a sold out market. I think the other thing that’s perfectly inherent is California is working its way back to equilibrium. I think one of the things that we’re most excited about is coming back and increasing the efficiencies in all of our plants Trey, within the permit limits to make sure that we can really meet this rising demand need also in a situation in Texas where do see pricing going up very nicely. So I guess my point would be this, in a sold out market, you’d expect pricing to go up. In a market in which frankly we need to make that plant profitable, you’re going to see as push price, we’re deciding our brand, because we need to do that. But what I think as well is we can come back and add as much as 250,000 additional tons of cement to our business next year just through efficiencies. And I spoke in my prepared remarks of what our teams were doing to ramp those up and simply getting a place like Hunter and Hunter [One] that’s operating in the high 70s up to something closer to deals like 85% working its way toward 90% which is the type of the theoretical world class capacity that we’re looking to. Giving us that type of volume in that type of pricing environment is where we think we need to be.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Great. Thanks for the response, Ward. And good luck.
Ward Nye:  Thank you very much, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne.
Ward Nye: Timna welcome back.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I just want to take a step back and ask a little bit since this acquisition didn’t burden you too much on the balance sheet, I wanted to hear a little bit more about your thoughts of uses of cash down the road as we look into 2015. So you touched on some optionality perhaps of expanding at Midlothian, you have clearly the acquisition environment seems to be hued a little bit for aggregates. So just wanted to get your panorama of opportunities and how you’re thinking about it?
Ward Nye: That’s a fair question, Timna because I think we’re going to have a nice [sprouting] going forward because I think we’ve got what is going to be a remarkably cash generative business. I think the opportunities to continue to grow our business responsibly is one that we’re excited about. So number one, we’ll look at it from that lens. And number two, we are going to come back and look very carefully the way that we put capital into the business as well because part of what we’ve seen over the last several quarters and we’ve talked about it as volume ramps up, rolling stock needs some help. And we’re going to make sure that we’re putting appropriate and sensible capital in rolling stock. The other thing that we’re always going to be sensitive to and always look at is coming back and looking at share repurchase and where we are. We’ve got an authorization from our Board right now that we’re mindful of, but we’ve -- look we like acquisitions we like Martin Marietta too and we’re going to be looking at that going forward. Part of what I’m grateful for is, shareholders, as you said, we didn’t put our balance sheet in any form of -- in fact our balance sheet is in a very good place. At the same time, shareholders would like to see some of the natural dilution that occurred from that go way and we’re sensitive to that. So, we’re going to be looking basically at what we’re going to do with acquisitions, we’re going to be looking at what we’re doing with capital and we’re going to be looking at really what we can do with extra cash. The thing that I would remind we’re 120 days end. So, it all sounds exciting and it is exciting. And we think it’s a great story, but I’ll say we’re 120 days there.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That make sense. Just to be able to more granular real quick and I know there has been a lot of discussion about this, but on the rail side our folks are expecting that this isn’t a temporary situation this could last into next year and even two years. And I just want to understand how the mechanism would be if you were pass along price hike. Would that be lag effect, could you do it on a case-by-case basis or how might that look?
Ward Nye: I think it’d be several form. I think you can look at just a pure price increase. I think you can look at surcharges, although that’s never been a mechanism that we prefer. And again, I think part of what we can do to mitigate that because of the way that we build our rail yards, if the traffic is going down we can put in longer train. If we’re going with distributed power and by that meaning really two locomotives one at the front one in the middle, we can go in and we consider being more than 100 cars and that’s the dialogue we’ve been having with all the Class 1 railroads.
Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Sounds like you’re on it. Thank you for your help.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Timna.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Hey guys, how are you doing?
Ward Nye: Hi Ted.
Anne Lloyd: Hi Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Anne, I was wondering if you could go through the EBITDA bridge that we’ve historically done on the legacy side of it. I know you have made comments, I think you have outlined $8 million or $9 million of headwinds on rail and maybe four R&M on legacy side. But could we just go through that? And I know on slide six you had kind of a $49 million bucket, but could we maybe just aggregate what that is?
Anne Lloyd: Okay. So the $49 million bucket, can we have a detail of that in the back, excuse me Ted. That’s going to include -- has it been adjusted? There has been no detail provided on that one, excuse me. But those cost increases are going to include for the aggregate product line the $9 million on rail that we’ve been talking about; the $4 million on maintenance and supply; and then the normal cost increase that come along with the volume on the business.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: And so when you go into the cost, could you just help us understand, I mean last quarter you guys were very helpful in kind of explaining inventory dynamics. Was there a repeat of that at all in the legacy business this quarter?
Anne Lloyd: Not at all. As we indicated in the last quarter, it was -- we didn’t it was, but no there was not. We made the conscious decision and to reduce inventories for the second quarter. And now the inventories we think are in good balance. 
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay. So, those are kind of the key factors that you would bridge on the legacy aggregates business?
Anne Lloyd: Yes.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay. And then on the specialty products, I guess we’ve come to expect incremental kind of a net 30% range, it was a little low this quarter. Were there any kind of discrete cost items that would have weighed on incrementals that will be helpful to be aware of?
Ward Nye: Really you’ve got two things there Ted, I mean you’ve got natural gas pricing year-over-year up but 2Q to Q3 down that’s the quick way to think about that. The other issue that we’re faced within that is we did have a kiln shutdown that affected that business to the tune comparatively about $1.2 million. So if you look at the net gas and the kiln down for a period of time, which happens, I mean that’s just a way that this (inaudible) outage. That’s entirely the difference.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay. And then the last thing I was hoping to ask before I jump back. When you talk about infrastructure being up potentially mid double-digits -- I’m sorry, mid single-digits next year, could you walk through how much of that is public versus private and how you’re thinking about the public piece of infrastructure?
Ward Nye: That’s all public in our domain. Although, there may be pieces of it that have a P3 component to it, because as you know on all major infrastructure projects now in the United States under map 21, they have to go and look if whether a P3 element would makes sense to go with it. But as we’re looking at that just to be clear, it’s all public infrastructure.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: And then so, are you making any assumptions on the federal highway bill, the highway bill or is that all kind of driven by other programs mostly state and local?
Ward Nye: I guess the primary -- it’s primarily driven on the upside about what’s going on in the state right. Because they’re clearly taking more and more charge of what they’re doing. On the federal side Ted, the primary thing we’re assuming is just going to keep on, keeping on, it’s relatively flat in our view and that’s the assumption that we’re making.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: So that was the last thing I wanted to ask, because just kind of what’s the latest you’re hearing on the highway bill, optimism you have or like thereof and then I’ll get back in queue?
Ward Nye: Sure. I guess here is to take I’ve got Ted and nobody’s that’s been right on it. So you can probably add me to that queue as well. I think legislative fatigue is going to take this over. If we look back to the last of $11 billion that when it showed up, every time they go to the well looking for whatever the next $11 billion is, it gets harder to get. And I think one of the things that I was most moved by as I was reading this week is this notion that if the Republicans for example took the House from Senate, one of the issues they’re concerned about is that they don’t demonstrate an ability to govern. They don’t feel like they’ll get a shot at a White House in 2016. And as we’re looking at things that are simply fundamental to job creation and economic growth, the transportation bill is one of them. And part of what we’ve seen there’s been recent study that actually did put out early in the month or last month things that are sustainable feel like this would add 2 million jobs of construction jobs in the United States. So, I think as we sit here and consider the fact that they’ve kicked the can down the road but there is just not a lot of road left to kick the can down. I think our sense is we do end up getting a fixed; they do have to deal with the rough side of it. Nobody necessarily needs to do that but simply gasoline going down as much as it has over the last several weeks and months and the fact that it’s likely to continue going down may give people opportunities to do that. That’s probably a long answer Ted. I’m not sure that it’s precise but it’s probably as good as anybody can offer right now.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: That’s very helpful guys. Best of luck this quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks Ted.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your question please?
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Yes, a couple of questions. First on the NOLs, you raised your estimate to 500 million. Can you just kind of update on timing of how the shape or form you’ll be realizing those?
Anne Lloyd: Yes, we actually think over the next several years and if you look in the press release, this year we indicated that in 2014 we’ll actually be able to use 84 million of those NOLs.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust:  Do you have a ‘15 estimate at this point?
Anne Lloyd: We don’t have -- well, I do, but we haven’t talked about it. We’ll talk about that when we release guidance for the balance the year.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Are these NOLs in the next let’s call it 18 months or so, are they on foregoing capital gains taxes or are they on operating income?
Anne Lloyd: It’s operating income.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: And I think you said 39% tax rate in the fourth quarter so that seems a little high considering you’re getting an NOL. How does that all work out?
Anne Lloyd: Well, as I indicated early, this is the effective tax rate, the NOL only deals with your cash taxes.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Okay, I got that. Thanks.
Anne Lloyd: And we’ve also indicated we estimate cash taxes for the full year is expected to be about $13 million.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Switching back to the previous question on assumption for infrastructure spending in ‘15, you’re assuming flat federal dollars that would mean at same stage what have to be double-digits less or some kind of [trickier] offsetting there, can you reconcile that for me, Ward?
Ward Nye: I think we don’t see it could be offsetting there because if we’re looking at 77 hot lanes in Charlotte at high four, and Charlotte -- I mean in Florida right now if we’re looking at what’s going Interstate 35E and Dallas and we’re looking at more underground Park Lane in Houston. Those are just some of the headline projects. We also think that we’ll see more of those come through as we enter into ‘15.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Okay. And then final question, I know you don’t typically breakout revenues by state or geographies, but Texas becomes so important to you here and so many good things going on. Can you just give us a feel of how much of the my revenues are intensive?
Ward Nye: We’ll give you some more of that at the end of the year. Here is a good way to think about it, look at what’s going on in non-resi in United States because that’s an area that’s we’re getting considerably better year-over-year, it’s fasting. Look we’ve seen an additional $30 billion of non-resi activity in the United States this year. What that means effectively is that $45 billion of areas that are up about $15 billion that are down, but next year to the 30. Here is the takeaway, $15 billion of it is in Houston all by itself. So that gives you a sense of to your point how important and how dynamic Texas is but at year-end we’ll come back to give you the snapshot.
Anne Lloyd: And Keith just a reminder, we obviously will have to likely be what we’ll give you is what we think 2015 looks like because obviously 2014 will only have half the year of TXI’s operations in it.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Yes, I was looking for pro forma combined.
Anne Lloyd: Yes. So, we’ll give that to you as we come out with the annual guidance.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Thanks Keith.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your question please.
Mike Betts - Jefferies: Yes. Thank you very much. I just got two questions left, if I could. Firstly on SG&A and I heard your comment on the check side that was fill-up by another $10 million to go out which we at least give about $5 million in that, that seems extremely low on almost a billion of sales. Maybe I’m missing something and I guess the real fundamental question Ward is with the new IT system and with cement potentially requiring less SG&A. Now we move to structurally lower level of SG&A as a percentage of sales within the business? And then my second question just on the TXI heritage aggregates price, the $11.83. You gave an explanation, Ward and thank you for why it was higher. My question is though do you report the aggregates pricing any different from the way TXI reported that number. I mean is there a some kind of accounting difference or actually is that all mix I mean with that number similar to what they would have looked like and you are attempting? Thank you.
Ward Nye: I’d say, let’s do this way, let’s bifurcate that. I’m going to talk about pricing and aggregates and Anne is going to talk a little bit about SG&A. I think this is what’s going on. I do think you are seeing sand short in much of Texas to give you a sense of it. The sand and gravel numbers that we’re seeing in much of Texas right now is actually ahead of our corporate average. So it’s somewhere between $11 and $12 a ton. We’re also -- keep in mind and this is different. We gave up those two yards at Frisco and Dallas. We picked up 8, so that’s 8 yards, so we picked up in Texas. The average selling price of those yards is in excess of $60 a ton. Now Mike to answer your question directly when we come back and look at what’s going on at the stone facility that we picked up in North Texas, they do tend to be considerably lower than our corporate average that’s something that we’re working on right now and that help TXI would have rolled all of that out. And you do have some dynamism in the market right now, particularly relative to what’s going on in sand and gravel that has used that. I hope that’s responsive to your question. I’ll let Anne to talk about SG&A.
Mike Betts - Jefferies: Thank you.
Anne Lloyd: Change in SG&A, I do believe that we’re entering an area and arena at time we will have some structural change. As I think about 2015 and beyond, I don’t believe a 5.3% SG&A level on this side is sustainable, but neither do I think it’s going to be 7.5%. I think if I was modeling, I’d probably put in 6% to 6.5% of total sales as a pretty decent run rate on a business at this revenue base. But obviously we like to always outperform against our target. So we’ll always work to keep that going down.
Mike Betts - Jefferies: That’s great. Thanks both of you.
Ward Nye: Thanks Mike. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please?
Stanley Elliott - Stifel: Hey, thank you for taking my question, most of have been answered. Real quick on the specialty products. You mentioned the kiln shutdown. What happens in Q4 to kind of get to the gross profits ramp like it’s schedule to do according to guidance?
Ward Nye: Look, I think we just -- the pricing is working we’re seeing a lot of demand for clays, we’re seeing a lot of demand for chemical products as we come back and look at the types of margins that we’re getting on that business on a record quarter. I don’t see anything disrupting that. And we won’t have to count them. I think those are your differences, Stanley.
Anne Lloyd: I’ve got to say we’ve got a 34% margin on that business for the quarter. It’s a darn good business.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel: No look, I think it’s 32 but when you look at it, the sequential ramp relative to how it’s been historically, I was just curious, plus I got out of questions.
Anne Lloyd: We’ll give you that.
Stanley Elliott - Stifel:  Thank you. 
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Ward Nye for any closing comments.
Ward Nye:  Thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call. We remain to running this business in a world class fashion. We’re convinced we’re going to do it and we’re convinced that we’re going to have the returns as a company of world class business. We look forward to talking you about that when we’re together in February and we look forward to seeing you in New York in February. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s program, Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we announced in our earnings release this morning, second quarter 2014 results reflects record net sales of $602 million and earnings improvement. Net sales growth was driven by a 13% increase in aggregate’s product line shipments and a 5% increase in aggregate’s pricing compared to the second quarter of last year. Additionally, our specialty products business again achieved new quarterly records for net sales and earnings. Importantly, the significant note that our growth was achieved in public and private sectors, a sign of economic stability and further recovery. Our performance through the first half of the year, combined with positive trends in key economic indicators of construction activity has led us to raise our aggregate’s product line volume guidance for the year to an increase to 6% to 8% over 2013. Earlier this month, we successfully completed our acquisition of Texas Industries. This transaction was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders of both companies and enhances our strategic position in major aggregates and concrete markets in Texas. It also provides us with participation in the growing cement markets in Texas and California at a very opportune time. However before further discussion of the events of the quarter, let me remind you that today’s teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Now for additional commentary on our quarterly performance. We experienced aggregate’s product line volume growth in all of our end-use markets with notable strength in private construction. Shipments to the non-residential market represented 31% of our volumes and increased 16% over the prior year quarter led by both energy and commercial sectors. We continue to benefit from our industry-leading position and participation in supplying building materials to the nation’s major shale energy developments. We are also benefiting from growth in commercial construction driven partly by the ongoing residential construction recovery in a host of our markets. The residential construction market which comprised 14% of our quarterly aggregate’s volume aggregate’s led private sector construction activity, shipments to this end-use increased 20% over the prior year quarter. On a year-to-date basis, housing starts are up approximately 7%, an encouraging sign for the durability of the housing recovery. The ChemRock and Rail market comprised 10% of aggregate’s shipments and increased 13%. We were pleased to see a 9% increase in volume to the public sector which represented the remaining 45% of our aggregate’s product line shipments. Growth was notable in the west and southeast groups which experienced increases of 16% and 21% respectively. The west group improvement was driven by activity in Texas and Colorado where state department of transportation budgets have been positively affected by the ability to secure alternative financing sources. Texas volumes reflect the ongoing benefit of nearly $8 billion in multi-year transportation projects awarded by the State Department of Transportation in 2013. Our Colorado operations are benefiting from continued reconstruction efforts following last year’s historic flooding. Additionally, earlier this year, Colorado approved its first public private partnership project to renovate and expand US highway 36 corridor. Growth in the southeast group reflects early signs of recovery in Georgia after many years of underinvestment. The Georgia Construction Aggregate Association reports Metro Atlanta aggregate shipments increased 29% in the first half of the year and Georgia DOT aggregate’s consumption increased over 11% both compared to the prior year period. Additionally, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced a $10.2 billion DOT budget for fiscal year 2014, 2015, the highest level of infrastructure investment in Florida’s history. This budget together with the state public private partnerships provides a solid multi-year outlook for infrastructure activity. As we’ve often said, geographic location is critical and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on continued recovery. Growth in infrastructure shipments was achieved despite the overhang of the then pending of expiration of MAP-21, the current federal highway build. We believe this demonstrates a strong underlying demand for infrastructure investment and the fact that was underscored recently when the US House represented its past legislation to provide $10.8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund and extend the provisions of MAP-21 through May 31, 2015. The Senate is expected to address highway legislation before the August recess and President is already on record in favor of the bill. We believe these are first steps toward the full reauthorization of a new multi-year federal highway bill. Geographically, growth in aggregate’s product line shipments was led by the west group which increased 22% of the prior year quarter. Encouragingly, the southeast and mid-America groups achieved improvement of 7% and 5% respectively. Recovery is accelerating in the east, particularly in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all fueled by strong employment numbers. We continue to believe this growth pattern will be experienced on a more widespread basis in the eastern United States. We were pleased to achieve aggregate’s product line pricing increases in each geographic group which led to an overall increase of 5% over prior year quarter. The growth was led by a 10% increase in the southeast group, which benefited from both improved and improving market conditions. We recently implemented mid-year price increases in many areas across the business and are also reaffirming our annual pricing guides. Aggregate’s product line production increased 10% in response to higher demand. Greater operating leverage led to a 5% reduction in cost per ton in both the west and southeast groups. Production cost for the Mid-America group was hampered by challenging weather conditions in the Midwest, that’s illustrated by Iowa’s third wettest June in 141 years. Midwest operations battled the elements through much of the quarter and experienced correspondingly higher repair costs. So, direct aggregate’s product line production cost per ton decreased slightly compared with the prior quarter. Finally, consolidated cost of sales were adversely affected by over $13 million when compared with the prior year quarter due to the impact of changes in inventory levels. In the second quarter of 2014, we reduced finished goods by 1 million tons. On a comparison, in the second quarter of 2013, we built over 2 million tons of inventories. Our vertically integrated operations consisting of asphalt concrete and road paving, each achieved sales growth over the prior year quarter. Notably, the ready mix concrete product line improved 48% reflecting both pricing and volume growth. On a combined basis, gross profit for these businesses increased more than $5 million over the prior year quarter. Overall, the aggregate’s business leveraged 20% increase in net sales into a 170 basis point expansion of gross margin to 20.7%. Notably, the Mid-Atlantic and Mideast divisions achieved an incremental gross margin consistent with our publicly stated expectations. The specialty products business again generated quarterly records for net sales and earnings from operations. Net sales were $61.9 million, an increase of 9%, primarily driven by growth in the chemicals product line. The business reported a gross margin of nearly 38%, which is up slightly versus the prior year quarter. As expected, consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 6.1%, a decline of 140 basis points. The reduction reflects lower pension expenses and the absence of information systems upgrade costs that were incurred in 2013. As previously mentioned, we’ve closed the TXI acquisition earlier this month by issuing 20.3 million shares of common stock. I want to publicly welcome our new members from TXI and look forward to their contributions to our company and shareholders. I’d be remised though not to acknowledge and thank all of our employees for their extraordinary work in connection with this transaction as well as the integration of TXI to our southwest division managed by Larry Roberts and now headquartered in Dallas. The collaborative teamwork that was exhibited throughout this transaction and at every level of the organization enabled us to move forward smoothly and greatly enhanced with our aggregates and ready mix concrete positions by adding operations in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. We also acquired three cement manufacturing plants and several distribution terminals in Texas and California. Our cement business also headquartered in Dallas represents a separate operating segment for our company and is managed by newly hired division President, Bob Kidnew who joins us with more than 20 years of cement industry experience. We are pleased that our internal day one operating targets from that and our teams are working hard on integration and synergy realization. We expect annual synergies of $70 million by 2017. We recently issued $700 million of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 4.25% ten-year senior notes and $300 million of three year variables rate senior notes. The proceeds along with available cash and incremental borrowings under in the trade accounts receivable facility were used to refinance the public debt we assumed from TXI, which carried an annual interest rate of 9.25%. Based on current interest rates, we expect to save $34 million of interest expense as a result of the refinancing. We also expect to realize additional value from TXI through the sale of non-operating real estate. TXI also provided more than $400 million of net operating loss carry-forwards as of May 31, 2013. We expect to utilize these NOLs as well as NOLs generated during fiscal 2014 over the next few years. Overall, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per diluted share this year excluding one-time costs as well as cash flow in the first full year following integration. Shortly before the closing of the transaction, we announced an agreement with the United States Department of Justice under which we would divest our North Troy quarry in Oklahoma and two rail yards, one in Dallas and the other in Frisco Texas. This agreement resolves all competition issues with respect to the TXI acquisition. As of the acquisition gain our market capitalization is nearly $9 billion. Further, Standard & Poor’s Dow Jones Indices announced our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. We view this as an endorsement of our financial stability and prospects for future growth. We are delighted to welcome new shareholders index based investment funds add our common stock to their portfolio. In anticipation of closing the TXI transaction, we incurred $5.3 million or $0.07 per share of acquisition and integration-related costs during the second quarter. For the quarter, earnings from operations were $96.2 million. Excluding TXI related costs, adjusted earnings from operations were $101.5 million, an improvement of more than 30% over the prior year quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $70 million of operating cash flow, 45% improvement over the prior year period. This increase is directly tied to our earnings growth. We remain in compliance with our leverage covenants and in that regard, our consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times at June 30, within our targeted leverage range. We recently modified the leverage covenant to exclude one-time acquisition and integration costs during the next 12 months. We also increased our trade receivables by $100 million. As amended, the facility has maximum borrowings of $250 million subject to the level of receivables. Looking at the balance of the year, please note that our forward guidance excludes the impact of TXI operations. As mentioned earlier, we fully expect the acquisition to meet the financial and strategic goals we set. We will provide you with more specific information about the impact of these new operations and their benefits to our results on our third quarter earnings call and we’ve had a full quarter of that business under our belt. As to the guidance, we are continuing to see the positive impact from a macro perspective. Moreover, the favorable trends in our business and markets especially growth in employment in general construction activity augur well for increased revenues and profits rise. The Dodge Momentum Index continues to forecast growth in non-residential construction and we expect further growth in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. Shale developments in related following public and private construction activities are anticipated to remain strong. Furthermore, the commercial building sector should benefit from improved market fundamentals including higher occupancies and rents, strengthened property values and increased real estate lending. Based on these factors, we anticipate non-residential end-use shipments to increase in the high single-digits. Residential construction should continue to grow in our primary markets driven by rising employment near historically low mortgage rates and pent-up demand. For the first time since 2007, total annual housing starts are anticipated to exceed 1 million units. We believe this trend will lead to double-digit volume growth in residential end-use shipments. For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 will increase slightly compared with 2013. Furthermore, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are expected to grow and continue to play a more role in public sector activity. Based on these trends and expectations we anticipate aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase slightly. Finally, our Chemrock and Rail end-use market is expected to have mid to high single-digit growth compared with the prior year. As previously mentioned, we increased our volume guidance and now expect aggregate’s product line shipments to increase 6% to 8% compared to 2013. Our outlook assumes that Congress approves measures to provide federal highway funding beyond the expiration of MAP-21 in September and an additional revenue source for the Highway Trust Fund. We also expect aggregate’s product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013. Aggregate’s product line direct production cost per ton is expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013. Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $385 million and $405 million of net sales and $40 million to $45 million of gross profit. Net sales from the specialty product segment should range from $225 million to $235 million generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas remains two key drivers for this business. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline compared with 2013, driven in part by nearly $8 million of non-recurring costs incurred in 2013 primarily related to the information systems upgrade, as well as lower pension costs in 2014. Interest expense should remain consistent with 2013. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 29% excluding discrete events and capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million. To conclude, we are excited about our business and how it’s positioned. Important key drivers for us are getting better. We expect to see further stability in the public sector which combined with continuing growth in private construction provides a great opportunity for us to continue our margin and profitability improvement. In addition, the timely acquisition of TXI enhances our ability to leverage and grow the dynamic western markets. As we look ahead, we remain focused on completing the integration of the acquired operation, capturing synergies and creating additional shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to your questions.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. And first focusing on the public end-markets, are you seeing any DOT slowing down in light of the uncertainty and do you see – we have not seen that based on our industry work with DOTs. But first, we’d like to see, what you are seeing on your add and then also if you could clarify what states are accepting more responsibility for funding versus relying fully on Federal? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, interesting question, short answer is we are not seeing state slowdown, we are hearing states talk about slowing down. So, our take is – the talk is more prevalent right now than the action is. This issue may recall states like Colorado earlier in the year came out and definitively said that they would move more slowly on public works. We haven’t necessarily seen that but in some instances, where we have seen edges of that. What’s happened is private work has been so robust. It’s pushing up public working to 2015 is actually something that we would welcome. So, that’s the primary take that we are seeing, but as we look at the states in which we are most active Texas, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, we don’t see it. Obviously, public works in Georgia has been under some degree – over the last several years period and if you look at what’s going on there, Kathryn, the city of projects in Georgia right now in the northwest parkway is this large, is the Georgia DOT budgeted. So coming back and answering the other part of your question, states like Georgia, North Carolina, soon is what we believe is kind of the I77 hot lane, Florida with I4, Colorado on Highway 36. Obviously, a lot of Texas C3 work right now. Those are the states that we are principally seeing that type of public private partnerships. We see a lot of those projects going now and believe that they will turn actually into same year projects in the foremost time. But that’s what we are seeing and I hope that’s responsive to your question.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Sure, it is. Moving over to price, last quarter, discussed having a mix impact of pricing. This quarter, put up 5% pricing which was ahead of expectations. Can you discuss the dynamic of mix and to pricing in Q2 and how we should think about that over the next nine to 12 months?
Howard Nye: So, when we look at Q1, several things we really have, you saw a geographic shift to the west and you are seeing more base activity particularly in markets like Houston. That was the primary shift that we are seeing. I think you saw that shift aside from the volume, I mean, obviously you had much more volume in the last – at 22% top in the west. I mean, that’s a notable number. So I think you had to take that into account. But from a pure mix perspective on product mix, we didn’t see that much of a shift or something that I would say is notable with one exception and that’s in Colorado, because we are selling a lot of fill materials in that market as they come nearly 9%. So Kathryn what we are seeing across the front is good solid steady price increases and of course I mentioned in our commentary as well that we saw a good number of mid-year price increase.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: And what’s the driver for the greater rate of increase in base stone versus clean stone pricing?
Howard Nye: I think several things, I think you are just seeing more new work and I think you are seeing more new work in two different dimensions. So I think you are seeing more new work in some divisions. You are seeing more new work in commercial construction and you are seeing more new work in these T-type projects going forward. So I think simply that’s product that’s more in demand and demand tends to drive product type. So think that’s primarily what we are seeing Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: And final question, what are the markets where you are pushing through amid your price increase?
Howard Nye: And what – as we look at mid-years, this year I am happy to report that we are seeing mid-year price increases in all divisions including specialty products. We actually saw wider slots as mid-year price increases this year and sure a number of them we saw last year. The blend goes anywhere from a low of up $0.30 a ton up to – in some instances to $2 a ton in aggregate, we’ve seen changes of $5 to $10 for cubic yard and ready mix. And of course, I mentioned in our commentary that we will talk more about TXI – our build per quarter . One thing we had to add under our belt is the ability to go and put in a cement price increase in both Texas and California and we will look for $10 a ton in both of those markets effective October 1.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Right, thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Kath.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your question please.
Lee Jagoda – CJS Securities: It’s actually Lee Jagoda for Arnie. Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Lee.
Lee Jagoda – CJS Securities: Ward, can you expand a little bit on the $13 million negative impact of profitability from selling product out of the – where there any segments in particular or any product line have been impacting more than others?
Howard Nye: And I mean the, the quick answer is, during the quarter, we reduced aggregate’s finished goods by million times and what you do when you do that is you effectively release the related capitalized costs into earnings. So as operations principally in our west and southeast groups use the inventory stockpiles to meet demand. The action we saw happened that was pulled down. Now as a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we build over 2 million tons of inventories and again that was primarily the west group. So when you have that type of swing in inventories, what we saw at the end of the day was consolidated cost of sales were adversely affected by a little bit north of $13 million. That was the swing.
Lee Jagoda – CJS Securities: Okay, and then just as a follow-up, could you modify the impact of the higher maintenance and repair costs in the quarter and maybe discuss some of the factors that led to the increased expense?
Howard Nye: Sure, and here is the way I would think about that, Lee. If we look at maintenance and repair and the part of our company that has seen volumes going well for a while and let’s focus on the west group, because that’s where our volume recovery has been more constant. Our MNR numbers in the west group are actually favorable. Now what’s happening is we are seeing our – it’s not horribly robust but we are seeing volume go up in both the southeast and in mid-America. So again, mid-America, 5.1, southeast up 7.3. What happens when you see that for the first time in a while is basically you are re-commissioning rolling style. And you are going to have certain costs as you re-commission it and then push it forward for some period of time and hopefully you won’t see that cost recur. So as we come back and look at that, clearly, we saw a rise in that in portions of the southeast and in portions of mid-America as volume then grew. It tended to be focused really on rolling stock, so primarily loaders, and I think that’s the primary issue. The other thing that I did mentioned in my commentary, I think it probably did us to the tune of a couple of million bucks was purely what was happening with some of the costs that were inherent and the weather that we were seeing in the mid-western United States. A lot of wind, some conveyor damage that came from that literally soft ball sized in part of that, and as I mentioned, one of the wettest Junes and in nearly 150 years. So, that does have an effect particularly when you are entering Q2 as we were.
Lee Jagoda – CJS Securities: Okay, thanks very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Lee.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack F. Kasprzak from BB&T. Your question please.
Jack Kasprzak –BB&T Capital Markets: So, good afternoon, Ward.
Howard Nye: Hi Jack. 
Jack Kasprzak –BB&T Capital Markets: Congrats on a good quarter. Relative to residential commentary which is strong for you guys in the quarter. However, housing starts lately have flattened out in particular in the east, basically flat in the second quarter. Should that not give us a little cause for concern with regard to housing activity in general and what we might do for your volumes in the back half of the year not in the south is a key market for you guys. Or are you guys seeing something different that might give you more optimism than what’s represented in the macro numbers right now? 
Howard Nye: Right, I think, Jack we have said it. I think we are in a time and you’ve heard us say it over the last, really a year that where you are today matters more than it has than any other time in our industry and such that you pause and look at housing in our markets right now, some of the numbers that I have seen, these are percentage changes over the last 12 months. North Georgia, clearly a market that has suffered disproportionately up 27%. San Antonio, a market that’s seen a lot of growth over the last several years still up 27%, Virginia up 26%, Florida, up 23%, parts of North Carolina, up 21%, Greensborough, the Triad has really had a tough time in this downturn, those numbers were up 12% and even if I go to a market like Houston that we would have told you a year ago it was not an recovery. But was an expansion even during that period of time that’s been an expansion. We are seeing numbers there up 11% right now. And I think part of what’s happening is you are seeing two things to in residential right now. You continue to see good multi-family. So we are writing around here in Raleigh anecdotally what’s going on. I am going to see a lot more multi-family in this market and I am going to see single-family in this market. But what that tells me is the single-family is likely coming behind that, Jack. So, I think as we look at our individual markets, I am not particularly alarmed by the more macro trends. So I think it’s about where you are.
Jack Kasprzak –BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, great. And second question is, within your non-res segment, how much of your volume is related to oil and gas activity, shale activity?
Howard Nye: And what if you want to go back and take a look, obviously, non-res for us last year was around 30% and if we look at what non-res was for the quarter, again, it’s lining up in a pretty healthy place. It was about 31% for the quarter. If we look at shale for all of last year, Jack, shale for last year was around 6.7 million tons and as we look at where we are this year, we see shale being healthier in 2014 than it was in 2013. For example, we are expecting annual growth in the Niobrara by itself of 10% to 15% and we continue to see good strength in Eagle ford. And surprising strength right now in Haynesville and I guess the one that continues to surprise me, we saw over 1 million tons last year simply going to the Marcellus. So that gives you a rack up of what’s going on in those shale plays is how that fits into the overall non-res.
Jack Kasprzak –BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, great. That does it for me. Thanks.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jack.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs:  Hi, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Can you please talk about out of the P3 projects that you alluded to, what proportion of your infrastructure business would you estimate that’s today and presumably your visibility is reasonably good on those projects going forward. I am wondering if you have a rough sense of how significant part of your infrastructure volumes that could be a year from now based on the projects?
Howard Nye: Well, Jerry, I think that can be a more considerable portion next year. If we look at what’s out there right now and markets that matter to us. In Georgia’s northwest corridor, in Texas, Grand Parkway has took your money, in California they are going to be a few that’s going forward, I think we should have some impact on. But if we look at what the likely next round of approvals is going to be, that’s much more meaningful to us. So in Texas, interstate 35 is in queue and North Carolina I-77 is. In Ohio, it’s 5 – in Florida we know I4 ultimate is going forward, but it’s going to get $50. So those are the ones that we think will stay in the next round of approvals. Even beyond that if we pause and take a look at what I think is in the queue but we are uncertain on the level of timing, there are couple of projects in Florida, really in the Tampa corridor. If you combine those two, you’ve still got the mid- Mid-Currituck Bridge in North Carolina. That's a $611 million project. And then by my last count, there were at least five other projects, state highway 288, 183, and Padre Island, and route 4 – I am sorry, those four in Texas and then two more in Virginia. So as we tally up what the work is that we think is, A, likely next round. We think those are pretty big and impactful projects to us and then when we look at the ones that have a more uncertain future timing. We think those two can be impact to us given the fact that much of it disproportionate number of it is either in Florida where we are the infrastructure people in Texas where we are a market leader.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Any chance you have the total project value out of the ones that you think are likely to move forward in those markets?
Howard Nye: You know what, okay. If we look at I35 east and Texas at $1.4 billion, I77 in North Carolina, the 50 is funding is over $0.5 billion the bridge and I mean the bypass in Ohio was $819 million and I4, again the TIFIA funding, $2.7 billion.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs : Thank you for sharing that and I am wondering, on the TXI cement business, you were kind enough to talk about the price increase announcements you've laid out. I'm wondering if you could update us on what the realized cement pricing was for the business in July or in calendar 2Q, if you're willing to share that?
Howard Nye: Here is the way that we are going to approach that Jerry and part of what I think I need to explain is like a process works when you are in a DOJ governed transaction like this, because part of what we recognize is until we had DOJ approval to close this deal, we couldn’t be certain that they was going to go. We felt confident that would but you can’t ever bid on. So what we never said, take our local management and put them in that business. We had people here at our headquarters looking at that. But Larry Robert, I mentioned Bob Kidnew in particular who is riding our Cement business has literally had 30 days of hands on time in that business. So what we are focused on right now is recognizing that the TXI Martin Marietta business that’s combined together going forward is a very different business and the TXI was the ruling here. And the management team that was there and responsible for that business is in large part not a part of the business going forward. So what we are going to do is really get this under our belt, come back and talk you about it the next earnings call. But what I’ll tell you is this, we have found nothing in our integration activities. We have done nothing in anything that we’ve done that has in any way diminished. How good we feel about this transaction and we feel very, very confident and comfortable that the numbers and strategies that we’ve laid out are very achievable.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And then if I could ask on the inventory de-stock, is there any additional room to go? Or was this the biggest chunk we saw this quarter? We'll talk about that a little bit more in the third quarter? 
Howard Nye: We will talk about that a little bit more in the third quarter. I mean, part of what we said for a while is particularly on base products, again, I don't think this is Martin Marietta issue, I think it's an industry issue. As the industry was going through the downturn and we were having to play more for clean washed stone, because that's what a lot of the stimulus work was and otherwise. People were genuinely building base. And then part of the earlier questions we had is, why are we seeing base pricing going up. Part of what we are seeing is more base activity out there. So again, it is not something that I lament. I think being able to go and rebalance the inventories is actually a very responsible and appropriate thing for us to do. And in some respects, Jerry, I hope we are faced with that problem. And I put problem in quotation marks.
Anne Lloyd: Jerry, it’s Anne and I would say that, possibly you could see some in Q3. Now if volumes continue to be as strong as they were in the second quarter, we could likely begin to see some inventory build as we hit the last part of the year to get ready for a strong construction season in 2015. But again, we will see that as we move through the balance of the quarter and complete our planning for 2015.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then lastly, if I could, on the capital deployment side, now that the TXI deal has closed, can you calibrate us on how you're thinking about capital deployment going forward in terms of buyback versus acquisitions? How does each path look to you? And I appreciate it might be a couple of quarters before you are willing to put capital to work after closing that transaction. But I would appreciate you giving us an update on your framework. Thank you.
Anne Lloyd: Okay. Thank you, Jerry. That’s a great question. I think one of the beauties of this transaction is it droves off tremendous amounts of cash and that as we’ve said, we thought we would be cash flow accretive within the year after the transaction was complete. So that will give us the opportunity to continue to look at capital deployment strategies. As always, we look at the strategy that the opportunities present themselves. But, it’s always looking at acquisitions to see in those places where we can continue to execute against our strategic plan to gain leading market positions across the US. Obviously, we have some organic capital needs. We’ve estimated about $50 million this year for TXI on top of the capital deployment that will do here and then we do have an outstanding authorization for share buyback. Then we firmly believe that a share buyback plan is an important part of the capital allocation strategy as we continue to get – build out the cash transaction. We have committed to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and I think that’s important to our public debt holders and these things will have plenty of opportunity there. 
Howard Nye: And Jerry as a reminder, we do have an authorization as Anne said to repurchase up to 5 million shares. So, just as a reminder that is there.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye:  Thank you, Jerry. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Olin from Cleveland Research Company. Your question please.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research Company: Hey, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Chris.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research Company: Just wanted to ask on transportation. There has been some talk that either cement or aggregate volumes had been running a little bit softer because people couldn't get the rail or trucking necessary. I am wondering if that impacted you all during the quarter and will it have any type of impact in the next quarter or so?
Howard Nye: The short answer, I think it is impacting some of the industry or much of the industry now, particularly with respect to trucking. And I think as you get into areas where there is a great deal of shale activity. So if you are looking at parts of Niobrara, or you are looking at parts of South Texas where there is some lot of trucking that’s been utilized in those shale plays and by the way pretty well paid trucking activities, it’s hard at times to get the truck. So, I think, when you factor that out realistically, it is a challenge in some markets. It’s not a challenge in all of them. But if we look at trucking today versus where trucking was a year ago, it is a more difficult component today. The rail business is spotty. I mean, there are going to be some places that you are going to see services to actually going to go very well. There are going to be others and service is going to be more challenged. I wish I could tell you there was a – that did to the way that that works, I don’t know that there is, in fact I am relatively confident that there is not. So, Chris, if I am sitting for you are, I would factor a little bit of trucking difficulties into these markets. Some of them, but I think not just for this year, that’s probably a multi-year issue that the industry has to be sensitive to in playing around.
Anne Lloyd: What we do see, Chris, thought is, historically as activity picks up and demand picks up, rail shortage, rail movement shortage is not uncommon. I’ve kind of take it as a good sign that economic recovery is expanding beyond just the construction materials business, while that real shortage can create challenges and also creates opportunities, because we’ve got a nice rail network that we can leverage and it also gives you the opportunity to realize the value of the products that you are moving.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research Company: Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your question please
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Good afternoon, Anne and Ward.
Howard Nye: Hi, Trey.
Anne Lloyd: Hi.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Can you – I appreciate some of the color you’ve given us on the mid-year or I guess the fall price increase for cement, $10 a ton for California and then also Texas. But how do we think about the rollout there, and how it impacts the overall cement pricing, as far as timing? 
Howard Nye: I think, it’s price matter. I think the timing is going to be relatively immediate. I mean, that there is going to be some protection that is going to be in various markets, but at the same time, I think one of the reasons that we are talking thus far in advances to let people know this is coming. And part of what we have been very focused on is making sure that we are running that new TXI business absolutely sufficiently as we can and I think what this is indicative of is, we see a very good market in both Texas and California not measured by a period of months, and I think in particular measured by a period of years and I think we have an opportunity to make sure we are capturing value in that product.
Anne Lloyd: And Trey, we had indicated in earlier comment, as we rolled out all the public – required public disclosures of the TXI transaction that, about a third of TXI’s existing volume was covered under some form of longer term agreements. Those should be substantially gone by the end of this calendar year.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Okay, great. That's real helpful
Howard Nye: Okay, yep. 
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: And then one last question, looking at, and I know it’s early in the process, but I think there TXI's – excuse me, Midlothian plant had the opportunity or the permitting, however you want to talk about it, to expand by about 800,000 tons. And given the tightness that's in the market now, I mean, at what point does it make sense to start thinking about that expansion, and then on that as well, how long would the process be, if you decided to green light it hypothetically tomorrow, how quickly could that capacity come on?
Howard Nye: Trey, exactly it’s something that we would talk to more with you about going forward and I think the primary thing that we are focused on is making sure that we are making money. I mean, that’s what that game is about, that’s what we are going to do and that’s what the focus is going to me and Bob Kidnew and his team understand that very well.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: That's fair enough. And then, on concrete, very strong pricing and volume. Can you talk about the markets you're seeing there? Which geographic markets you're really seeing the strength there, both from a volume and pricing standpoint?
Howard Nye: I mean, most of the volume and price strength that we are seeing right now is really more driven and what we are seeing in our Colorado operations and I think if we are looking at what’s going on there, pricing has moved very, very nicely. Volume equally has moved well in that market. Again, the housing market is performing, the non-residential market is performing. Keep in mind, that’s going to be disproportionately driven in some instances, particularly in Rocky Mounts by private work anyway. So that is it need to be solid for us. We continue to feel like that’s going to be very good and we believe that, if we are looking what’s going on in the Dallas Fort Worth area, is particular right now, I mean there is just an immense amount of infrastructure work that’s going on in DFW. If you look at what’s going in with respect to single-family homes that got the lowest foreclosure rates in Dallas today that they had in 10 years. Sales were up 7% in June with over 9000 sold. That was really an all time high. So as we are seeing that type of massive infrastructure work that’s underway in that market. When we are seeing more and more commercial work, I mean to give you a sense of it right now, there is about 4.3 million square feet of construction underway just in Dallas. So we are seeing that in non-res. We are seeing that in res and then we are coming back and seeing, I 35 east, 635 state highway 184, lot of Dallas Area Rapid Transit or the DART work in that market as well. I think that bodes awfully well for what the ready mix business can look like in DSW and that’s the other big market that we have post TXI.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: That's very encouraging. Thanks a lot, guys and congrats on a good quarter.
Howard Nye: Trey, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: To follow up on the maintenance and rolling stock expenses you had in the quarter, just how we should think about that, moving forward, as demand improves. Should these be gradual expenses that we layer in, presumably as the cycle rebounds or will they be more as step function increases to get your rolling stock and capacity where it needs to be?
Howard Nye: Garik , as we go back in time and look at cycles, the latter is what’s almost always been. It’s almost been a step-function increase and then you go ahead and address the issues and then it evens out and you move forward. And I think, and so we saw it during the quarter.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, thanks. And just shifting to pricing for a second. Just in the southeast group, if we can dig in there, double-digit price increases, how much of that was mix versus – this will be a like-for-like price increase?
Howard Nye: Well, you know what, that’s an easy one to say because mix was actually not our friend. In the southeast this quarter, we are going better that notion that you see a lot of new construction there. So actually everything that you see in that number is the real McCoy.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, well, okay. So, I guess, just lastly, just two questions on TXI. Can you just update us with respect to where you are in the divestment process of the North Troy quarry and the rail yards?
Howard Nye: No absolutely – thanks for the question on that. As you know, that the assets that would divest as part of the transaction are actually heritage Martin Marietta assets which means from a timing perspective we recognize going in and that was likely to be the result. So, we were in a position to go ahead and start looking at options with respect to those sites earlier as opposed to layer, because they weren’t TXI sites. They were our own. So we can have the conversation. Our aim is this Garik, we are mature in that process. We believe it’s moving in a very constructive fashion right now and if we are still talking about a process at the next quarterly call, I’ll be disappointed. I think, we will have that done before you and I have a conversation like this again.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay that makes sense. Is it fair to assume that you're going to keep the North Troy results within the third quarter operations within the legacy business? Or is that going to be stripped out as a one-time?
Howard Nye: I mean, what we are doing is, we do have a whole separate quarter. So we are looking at North Troy separately from the rest of our business, but if you go back to what I’ve said about our teams and the fact that we had to operate in a very bifurcated fashion going through the diligence, we are having to do the same thing with North Troy right now. So, you understand it Garik.
Anne Lloyd:  But they are in our legacy operations, Garik. 
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, yes, that's what I was getting at. And then just lastly, you previously identified $70 million of operational synergies with the TXI deal. Now that it's closed, wondering, you only have a month in there. But I was wondering if you can provide any guidance if you could, at this point on any revenue synergy opportunities that you may have identified?
Howard Nye: You know what, obviously, we are looking at trying to finish up really a lot of just a pure integration right now, Garik. I’ll tell you, there is not a component of this business. That has been a surprise to us. There is nothing that has been a negative headwind. Obviously, I think we can come back and talk about what we think next year is going to look like, what pricing is going to look like and a host of markets including the FW at some point later in the year and I think that’s probably the best thing for us to do right now.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks so much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hello, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Anne and Ward, I was hoping to dig into the inventory dynamics a little more. I know you said you'll talk more about it in the third quarter. But just, as it relates to calibrating our models and expectations, could you just walk through at least as it pertains to 3Q and maybe 4Q. How you would expect to either draw from inventories or build? I think you made the comment that you may draw in the third quarter and build in the 4Q. As a starting point, did I hear that correctly? 
Anne Lloyd: Yes, you did, Ted, but, I am not going to walk through those dynamics, because that would in some ways – having us give quarterly volume guidance which we don’t to. I was just giving you a macro direction as to what I would infer that could potentially happen just based on the seasonality of the business and expectations for thinking about demand in 2015. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Absolutely understood and appreciated. And I guess the challenge we have is a year ago you over-produced, but didn't call it out. So now a year later when you have the reversal, it’s just hard to figure out how we should normalize for this dynamic. So guess, may be ask a little differently, could you just walk through where your inventories are now on the tons basis and where you exited 2Q, compared to 1Q and a year ago?
Howard Nye:  Go ahead. 
Anne Lloyd: If you look at inventory today for the aggregates business, we are about 54 million tons as of June 30 and last year we are about 65.4 million tons. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay and 1Q, if you don't mind.
Anne Lloyd: I apologize, Ted, I don’t have 1Q in front of me. I usually look at in a quarter based on what’s going on from the 12/31 perspective. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Sure.
Anne Lloyd:  That I’ll be happy to, we can answer that for you offline. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then just maybe again and this will be the last thing I will ask and we can go through it offline. But, in terms of how to think about what you target either as a percent of LPM or forward 12 months or annualized quarterly volumes, what do you target in terms of running the business? And where are we relative to kind of the peak and trough in absolutely inventories?
Howard Nye: The aim is four to six turns per year, Ted, I mean, that’s where we would like to be. It’s clearly that’s the more normalized process that you should expect from us. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And we're right now, like two turns?
Anne Lloyd:  In some areas, you are getting into that four range, but you are in that probably two to three turns, yes. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask about, I know you mentioned aggregate pricing increases ranging from $0.30 to $2.00 a ton and do you have an average that you put through at the mid-year?
Howard Nye: You know what, every market is different, Ted, and it may move within a 50 mile radius. So that we did not, we deal as we are honest with each market, very much on an individual basis. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: But you don't have a bottoms-up consolidated average?
Howard Nye: No, we don’t, not right now. Not that we want to talk about. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And just – I think you said it was up in, was it most markets or all markets? 
Howard Nye:  I mean, what I said was up in all divisions and it was up in more areas this year than it was last year and when I said all divisions, I also meant specialty products. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay could you – and the last thing I'll ask, could quantify when you say more areas this year than last, what those numbers are?
Howard Nye:  Last year, we said it was – from a division it’s all up, last year we said it was going to be about half of our districts and this year it’s comfortably more than half of our districts. 
Ted Grace – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, great. I'll get back in line. Thanks guys. Good luck this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Ted. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you for fitting me in here. Real quick, so when we think about the NOLs, a few years, is there a way to get a little bit better handle on how the pacing of the NOLs will be on a go-forward basis?
Howard Nye:  I’ll let Anne, talk NOLs. 
Anne Lloyd:  Yes, Stanley, we have indicated that we thought we would realize those NOLs over about a two to three year period. And from a pacing perspective, it’s going to depend on the earnings dynamic. Of course, we’ve not provided any – well. And I can tell you, if you think about TXI’s legal entities for those fiscal year, the short period and for the calendar year, you are probably going to actually increase the NOLs this year. You think about the one-time costs related to the transaction et cetera that I’ll get – have deductibility. So, I think the pacing of those really begins to pick up in 2015 and probably realizes over a three year period. 
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, and then, I apologize if I missed it, you talked about the North Troy assets, but what about some of the other assets that TXI had that were up for potential divestiture, kind of the non-core? Have you started making any progress with those and any color there would be helpful?
Howard Nye: What we had said, we felt there was probably about $100 million worth of excess property there. We continue to feel very comfortable around that number. It is something that we are focused on. I don’t want to give you a precise timing on when that will go because real estate are real estate deals. But again, we feel like comfortable within a couple of years we would have dealt with that. 
Stanley Elliott – Stifel Nicolaus: Perfect. Well, thanks very much and best of luck.
Howard Nye: All right, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Mr. Nye for any further remarks.
Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our second quarter earnings call and for your interest in our company. And as you know, we are committed to a very disciplined approach and our aim is to grow long-term shareholder value and we look forward to talking more about our heritage business and our new business with you when we meet next in October. Until then, take care, and thank you for your interest.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ward Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.
C. Howard Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials' quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we announced in our earnings release this morning, first quarter 2014 results reflect both sales growth and improved profitability. Aggregates product line shipments increased 8% for the quarter, with notable growth in Texas and Colorado. Importantly, despite the impact of unusually adverse winter weather, shipments for each month increased over the respective prior-year month, led by 13% growth in March. Higher net sales, coupled with diligent cost management, resulted in a 400 basis point improvement in the Aggregates business gross margin. In addition to our quarterly results, we're excited about our proposed business combination with Texas Industries. This transaction will enhance our position in Texas and provide an opportunity to serve the expanding California cement market. Most importantly, we believe the combination will create long-term value for shareholders of both Martin Marietta and TXI. As part of the combination process, we're continuing discussions with Department of Justice toward resolving our Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act filing or HSR. Although we're not yet in a position to publicly respond to any specific possible resolution, we believe any HSR issues will not be material. Accordingly, our views today regarding this aspect remained unchanged from January. We expect the combination will proceed on the original timetable, likely to close this summer. Before elaborating further on our first quarter results, let me remind you that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Now for more in the quarter. Private construction continued to be strong across all of our geographies, with each private end-use market achieving double-digit aggregates product line volume growth. The nonresidential end-use market represented 34% of our quarterly shipments and increased 13% over the prior year quarter. Growth was notable in the energy sector and, specifically, at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, where shipments, consisting primarily of base stone products increased over the prior year quarter. Private residential construction put in place during the first 2 months of the year increased more than 15% over the comparable prior-year period, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consistent with this trend, volumes to the residential market, which accounted for 15% of our quarterly shipments, increased 16% over the prior year quarter. As residential strength in many of our Western markets continues to both endure and grow, we are particularly pleased to see emerging residential strength in important Southeast areas, among them Atlanta and Charlotte. For example, in 2013, the 22-county Atlanta region experienced nearly 14,000 housing starts, up 67% year-over-year. And new-home closings were up 39%. In fact, the Metro Study Report is forecasting Atlanta housing starts to increase by another 25% in 2014. In Charlotte, home builders are projecting new starts to be up nearly 12%. This trend is supported by a recent Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers report projecting the Charlotte Metro area to be the 16th fastest-growing housing market in the United States in 2014 Wrapping up the private sector. Shipments to the ChemRock and Rail end-use market represented 12% of quarterly volumes and increased 14% due to higher ballast and agricultural lime shipments. The remaining 39% of our aggregates product line business went to the infrastructure end-use market. Despite the impact of winter weather, public sector shipments were positively affected by state funding initiatives and were flat compared with the prior year quarter. We noted growth in the West Group, particularly in Texas and Colorado, where robust state funding programs, along with public-private partnership initiatives and the promise of long awaited TIFIA awards provide additional funding sources for transportation investment. As previously noted, we expect state initiatives to play a more critical role in future public-sector activity. That said, the infrastructure market continues to be unsettled by the lack of certainty surrounding long-term federal highway funding. To that end, we continue to monitor congressional deliberations regarding the federal transportation funding beyond the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, which is scheduled to expire on September 30. Additionally, a revenue infusion is needed to maintain an uninterrupted flow of reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund now expected to encounter a funding deficit before the end of the fiscal year. Over the previous 5 years, Congress has used general fund transfers to bridge the shortfall. Amid this circumstance, several states, including Colorado, Georgia and Iowa, have stated their intentions to take a cautious approach on committing to major projects until federal funding is stabilized. As a practical matter, since most state fiscal years start on July 1, it is possible fundings [ph] will be weighted toward later in the various state fiscal years. On a positive note in that regard, both the House Transportation and Senate Environmental and Public Works committees have announced their support for a new highway bill at existing funding levels, plus adjustments [ph] for inflation. Further, both President Obama and House Ways and Means Chairman, Dave Camp, included highway trust fund remedies in their respective tax reform initiatives. Due to a combination of geography and product mix, our aggregates product line experienced a 1.3% average selling price decline versus the prior year quarter. Notably, base stone and sand and gravel shipments, particularly in the West Group, represented an expanded share of our quarterly sales. We view this as evidence of early-stage construction activity and an attractive precursor to more follow-on clean stone demand still to come in a host of our markets. If our aggregates product line had the same geographic and product mix as the first quarter of 2013, the average selling price would have increased approximately 1%. Aggregates production decreased 2.4% as sufficient workdays were either hampered or lost due to extreme weather conditions, including snow, ice and freezing temperatures. For example, our Greensboro district was shut down 10 days during the quarter due to such weather constraints. As expected, the decline in production led to an increase in production cost per ton. We estimate that as a result of unusually adverse winter conditions, aggregate direct production costs were impacted by $5 million. Our vertically integrated product lines each reported growth in sales and gross profit. Ready-mix concrete product line achieved a 45% increase in net sales, reflecting volume and pricing growth. The asphalt line reported increased shipments, which led to a 9% increase in net sales. The road pavement business nearly doubled its net sales, primarily due to increased activity in Colorado. The Specialty Products business continued to make a significant contribution to our consolidated results. For the quarter, net sales for this business were $57.4 million, an increase of $2 million, which was driven by both growth -- driven by growth in the chemicals and chemicals product line. The business reported a gross margin of nearly 33%, which was negatively affected by increased usage of natural gas and the impact of a colder-than-expected winter on natural gas pricing. Consistent with our outlook for the year, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.4 million or 190 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction is due to the absence of costs related to the information systems upgrade completed late last year. Additionally, pension expense declined from the prior year. Our adjusted consolidated loss from operations was $6.4 million compared with a loss from operations of $23.3 million in the prior year quarter, an improvement of over 70%. That said, we, of course, incurred business development expenses related to the pending combination with TXI. For the quarter, these costs totaled $9.5 million. Inclusive of these costs, our consolidated loss from operations was $15.9 million. Our loss per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding business development expenses, our adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.35 compared with the loss per diluted share of $0.61 for the prior year quarter. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $7 million, which reflects the impact of higher net sales on working capital. We prudently invested $37 million in capital projects and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At March 31, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 2.74x in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant. Looking ahead to the full year 2014, we continue to see positive trends in our business end markets, especially private-sector employment and general construction activity. Nonresidential construction is expected to reflect growth in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. Shale development and related follow-on public and private construction activities are anticipated to remain strong. Furthermore, the commercial buildings sector should benefit from improved market fundamentals, including higher occupancies and rents, strengthened property values and increased real estate lending. Based on these factors, we anticipate nonresidential end use shipments to increase in the mid- to high-single digits. Residential construction should continue to grow in our primary markets, driven by near historically low mortgage rates and rising employment. For the first time since 2007, total annual housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units. We believe these trends will lead to double-digit volume growth in residential end-use shipments. For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 will increase slightly compared with 2013. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are expected to grow and continue to play a more enhanced role in public-sector activity. Based on these trends and expectations, we anticipate aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase slightly. Finally, our ChemRock and Rail end-use market is expected to have low-single-digit growth compared with 2013. Cumulatively, we look for aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 5% compared with 2013. The most significant risk to our aggregates volume guidance will be congressional actions and timing surrounding the expiration of MAP-21 in September, along with uncertainty over funding for the highway trust fund. We also expect aggregates product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013, although this increase will not be uniform across the company. Aggregates product line direct production costs per ton are expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013. Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $385 million and $405 million of net sales and $40 million to $45 million of gross product. Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $225 million to $235 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices remain 2 key drivers for this business. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline compared with 2013 driven in part by nearly $8 million of nonrecurring costs incurred in 2013, primarily related to the information systems upgrade, as well as lower pension costs in 2014. Interest expense should remain consistent with 2013. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 29%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million. To conclude, we are encouraged by numerous macroeconomic indicators of increased construction activity for 2014. We believe the private sector will continue its strong growth, which, coupled with increased state level funding of key projects, should stimulate public-sector activity. We also remain enthusiastic about the pending combination with TXI. We believe our expanded platform for growth and increased levels of construction activity are a powerful combination that will enhance long-term shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: I think the first thing, Ward, is congratulations on your new role within the company, well deserved. Could you expand a little bit, you talked about geographic issues impacting pricing and mix. Could you expand a little bit on both of those, since pricing early in the year does tend to have a fairly important impact for the overall company for the year?
C. Howard Nye: Sure, Arnie. And Arnie, thanks for your comments, too. I really do appreciate that. Here's the way I think about volume -- or pricing in Q1. Look, we had strong volume increases in Rocky Mountain and we saw strong volume increases in the Southwest. So really, those are 2 of our lowest priced areas. So if we think about that in varying degrees of context, in the Southwest, we saw base sales go up by almost 1 million tons, but we saw clean stone stay relatively static from a volume perspective. Now what I'll tell you is the base stone pricing went up as did the clean stone pricing, but still that's 1 million more tons of base, which is obviously a lower priced product in a lower-priced market. Similarly, if we look in the Rocky Mountain division up and down the front range in Denver, again, if we're looking at base and fill material in that market, they are up about 2x over where they were last year in the first quarter. So again, you're looking at a lower-priced market and lower-priced products going. I actually think that's a good sign, Arnie, because what it's telling us for the first time in a long time, we are seeing new construction. And part of what I tried to spell out in the prepared remarks is that's simply going to be a driving force for more mature construction that's coming behind it. And in fact, we're seeing some of that in the pricing that we're seeing in concrete stone and asphalt stone. If we look at pricing for the quarter for concrete stone, that was up 2.9% for the quarter and pricing for asphalt stone was up 3.7%. So as we come back and revisit where we are relative to pricing, to us it is truly a geographic and a products mix issue. Our confidence around the pricing story continues to be very high and I think what we're seeing in Texas on a continuing basis and what we're seeing in Colorado are very, very good signs.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Were there any markets you didn't actually have some price increase in the materials that you were selling?
C. Howard Nye: When we're going to same product, same quarry, this is not a marketplace in which we are seeing pricing retreat. Again, as we are looking at pricing, we're watching it go nicely up. There are a number of markets that we didn't put price increases in until April 1. As you recall, that's really when much of the construction season's starting in earnest anyway. But I think that answers your question. Did I hit what you needed, Arnie?
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Absolutely. Very thorough. My other broad question which I'm sure is on the mind of virtually everyone on the call is you have the potential for a transformational acquisition with Texas Industries and yet we're having some issues with the DOJ. Is there a way you can perhaps expand on some of the issues you're dealing with and how this might get resolved?
C. Howard Nye: Sure. Happy to do that. Actually, we are precisely where we thought we would be with DOJ right now. I mean, you're right, there's a second request. The second request is really quite narrow. We feel like the issues that are involved in the second request and we're working with DOJ staff right now are very much in line with what we had anticipated. We think this is a circumstance that's likely to be resolved in a matter of weeks. Because as you'll see, we are not changing our ideas around when the closing will occur. The other thing I will tell you, if this gives you some comfort around it, if we look at the scope of the second request, what that tells us is the view that we've long held that there should not be any quarries put up for sale in Texas is very much consistent with what we thought it would be. So from a timing perspective, Arnie, I think we're exactly where we thought we would be. Looking at the markets and anticipating what the likely result is, I think, again, we're exactly where we thought we would be. And the conversations and dialogue with DOJ staff continues to move along in what we feel like is a very constructive, very progressive way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just to kind of expand on the last set of questions. Can you talk about the range of the price increases that have gone in this -- so far this year and the timing?
C. Howard Nye: Todd, they will vary. Some will have gone in on January 1, some probably would have gone in on around April 1. If I'm looking at the data that we have right now, in some markets, I'm seeing price up as much on a percentage basis as 14% in some areas. Obviously, there are going to be other areas that will not have that degree of price increase. I don't really want to go market by market for, obviously, competitive reasons and give you a sense of that. But again, if we're looking same on same, price increases are very much where we thought they would be, Todd.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: That's good. With regard to your aggregates margins, nice looking performance in the quarter, which is interesting given that price was down or the average price was down and you mentioned in the release that production was also down. So can you talk about how you were able to pull that off at the margins?
C. Howard Nye: Number one, I would say we had awfully good cost control and I think that's real kudos to our team. Here's the way that I'd like to think of it for the quarter, Todd, and I think this is a story that we haven't been able to say for a long time. If you come back and take a look at the quarter and you put $9.5 million of extraordinary costs to the TXI transaction, and if you want to come back and basically say that our gross profit was hit by another $5 million, simply due to what we dealt with extraordinary weather. And the biggest component of that was felt principally in our Midwest Division right now or Mid-America. At the end of the day, that's another $5 million. You come back and take that $9.5 million on the extraordinaries with TXI and the $5 million that we feel like we were hit because of the extraordinary weather, basically we're looking at a breakeven Q1, and I think that's pretty impressive because when you go back and take a look at it, that's 24.6 million tons of sales. Back in Q1 of '12, we had 24.9 million tons of sales and on a normalized basis then probably around $0.47 per diluted share loss normalized. And if we're looking at something that feels awfully like breakeven, when you pull out these extraordinaries, I think what that tells us is the cost structure continues to be in the right place. The team is focused on the right things and what we believe we can do relative to pricing continues to be very consistent.
Anne H. Lloyd: Todd, I think, you could almost summarize it by saying when the sun was shining, we were shipping, and that's just not very common in the first quarter.
C. Howard Nye: And the odd thing, Todd, was that was true across the enterprise. I think what a lot of people would have assumed is in a market like Denver, that can be really profoundly affected by winter weather, to Ann's point, when the sun was shining in Denver, life was working pretty well there. So when we suddenly pause and come back and take a look at what was happening with respect to ready-mix in that market, ready-mix in Denver all by itself was up 35%. And asphalt remarkably up even more than that on a percentage basis in a remarkably weather impacted world. So it tells us the momentum we saw in '13 does continue into '14 right now.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And this is probably obvious, but that's a function of underlying demand and backlog, do you think at your customers?
C. Howard Nye: That's what we believe. Again, we think the momentum that we saw in Q4 last year, again, that we thought was very attractive, we think continues into Q1 and throughout the year.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And just sticking with Colorado for a second, do you have a sense for how much of the business there is rebuilding for the floods and FEMA money versus how much is highway money and how sustainable each of those things is?
C. Howard Nye: I think one of the big things that's odd about Denver right now, a lot of the flood and other Colorado DOT money has actually been a little bit slow coming out. I think we saw some of that come out quickly in Q4, simply because they had to. But I think they're looking at so much potential work there, it's coming out slowly. What that tells me is this: The private sector and, again, that's back to the commentary that we had, continues to not only be good, but continues to get better in that market. And from where we sit that's an attractive place to be because private sector work is actually more profitable work for us. So again, if we recognize there's going to be more public work coming behind that, it just continues to make us feel better about that market.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Final question for me. Specialty Products business. So given that you had an impact on the margin from nat gas in the quarter, but given you didn't change your guidance for the year, can I assume that you're anticipating that, that impact wanes or has already begun to wane? And can you talk about the sensitivity of the gas prices there?
C. Howard Nye: Well, it has begun to wane. I mean, steel continues to run at about 76% of capacity right now. Nat gas is back in that $5 range, which is really where we had kind of planned. Keep in mind, what we saw during Q1 was nat gas up year-over-year with the spike of 58% and usage up about 6.5%, because we had some lime constraints really because of that extraordinary weather, which made us operate our kilns in a fashion that's not optimal for running our business. So we think where we're sitting right now for the balance of the year and frankly with what we see as backlogs in the business, we have a lot of conviction around where that business will wrap up.
Anne H. Lloyd: And Todd, that increased usage and cost, our price was about $1.8 million impact on the cost structure of mag -- the Specialty Products business, excuse me, which really essentially, if you would normalize for that, the margins would have been essentially flat with last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: First question is just on pricing in the West Group. You called out mix as a pretty sizable headwind. Just wondering if you have a line of sight as to how long mix could be a headwind this year, are we looking at another quarter, another 2 quarters or there's going to be potentially a longer run headwind until the initial base stone shipments wear off?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, I think it could go for a while. And frankly, I hope that it does in many respects because if we look at the way -- let's talk about Houston for a second. Houston typically is a market that's running at around 85% clean stone. I mean, Houston is considerably below that right now on both sand and gravel and base material. But again, part of what's going on in Houston is they need base stone because they need to come back for new construction and there's been such little demolition in that market. Remember, that's one of the few markets in the United States where oftentimes recycled or crushed concrete can be used as the base product. So again, what we're seeing are some shortages on product like that. We're continuing to see new construction. And the fact is the more new construction that we see, while it may give an optical headwind on pricing, at the end of the day, Garik, that's all it is. Because even as I'm looking at these base price sales in the Southwest and in Denver, the prices are up year-over-year. And the clean stone prices will be up year-over-year. And specifically, coming back to Texas, as you recall, that was the market where last year we did see a number of midyear price increases. And I think you should expect us to come back and look for that again this year as well.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That makes sense, and I guess it's a good problem to have at this point in the cycle. But I guess just my follow-up there in the context of your pricing guidance being unchanged, just wondering if you could expand a little bit on how you're thinking about it. I can appreciate that there's -- that market volatility is not going to be uniform over the course of the year. But you can help us maybe bridge the gap between the reported price in the first quarter and what needs to happen for you to hit your guidance for this year.
C. Howard Nye: Right now I think in large part, we just need to see volume return to Mid-America and Southeast. Keep in mind, if we're looking at the first quarter, volume in the West was basically up a considerable percentage point. And at the same time, we're watching volumes down in Mid-America and Southeast, particularly as Mid-America comes back, that geographic shift all by itself, Garik, I think comes back and probably fills that hole that you're wondering about.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, makes sense. I guess my last question is on the volume guidance as well. Really good volumes in the quarter. But your full year guidance implies some deceleration in growth. Just wondering what you're thinking about respective volumes over the balance of the year, is it just a measure of caution with respect to the highway bill uncertainty or is there something else going on there?
C. Howard Nye: Okay, Garik, you nailed it. And that's exactly where we were a couple of years ago. And you remember that as well when we were in a reauthorization year. And suddenly it seemed like some win [ph] came out of it. Frankly, it's hard to sit here right now and see that win's [ph] going to come out of it, like it did then. At the same time, it's not our first rodeo with this. So I think to your point, coming back and just remembering what history has been and approaching it in a reason [ph] manner is what we're looking to do. As a practical matter, I think we will likely have some degree of resolution on what the rest of this year looks like on the highway bill relative to funding, probably before Congress leaves for the August recess. And if that's what we have, then when we come back at half year and report our half-year results, then we can come back and revisit where we are on volume guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: The first is on volume progression and the feedback that you had with March being up low teens was very much in line with what we had heard in the market. But in terms of -- if you could maybe dig a little bit more into regional and end market differences and it's -- you're steadily moving your mix shift away from the structure being a bigger percentage of your sales and res and non-res growing to be a bigger percentage. Obviously, we've seen growth there. But if you could maybe compare and contrast, as I said, on the end market and regional differences today and what you're seeing as we go into Q2 and how is that different than what you saw a year or 2 years ago?
C. Howard Nye: Kathryn, that's a good question, a fair one. Let's think about it this way. Let's start in Colorado and work our through the business. Here's a good way to think about what we're seeing in Colorado. I mean, we're continuing to see good residential activity there. We're seeing good commercial activity there. To give you a sense of it, last year at this time, we had 4 paving crews in place in Colorado. This year, we have 16 paving crews in place in Colorado. So again, what I would tell you, is we're watching every component of that economy hit pretty well. As we come a little bit farther south and take a look at the Midwest, again, that's never going to be a big driver on the res side, although res around Des Moines in Omaha is actually, for those markets, look pretty good. Again, what we're seeing is particularly good commercial activity there. We continue to see add-ons at data warehouses for Google, Microsoft and others in that marketplace. And again, what I would tell you on infrastructure there, it continues to be very, very steady. If we come a little bit farther south and take a look at what's going on in DFW and parts of Texas, I mean, DFW, we're looking at Interstate Highway 35 West with considerable tonnage. We're looking at State Highway 183, considerable tonnage. We're looking at homes up 60% year-over-year in DFW, now probably to a 25,000 per annum start right there. If we go down to Houston, we talked about the fact that that's usually a market that you see 85% of the market in clean stone. Base is now considerably up. We're seeing good toll road work there. We're seeing -- basically Harris County Tollway Authority now putting in a $900 million job in Q3. Res is up 8% in that market. When we come back and look at San Antonio, res is up 14% in that market and home inventories are down to 4 months only. So again, we're seeing great activity there. And then suddenly you hit South Texas and you got $5 billion worth of petrochemical or related work. And now for the first time, we are seeing people come back and really look hard at the Energy Sector road repair work that needs to be done there. So that's a good walk-through what we're seeing West and how some of that's moved. When we come East, what we have at last are markets that are important that are getting considerably better. I think part of what you heard us speak to with some degree of specificity is what we're seeing in particular in markets like Charlotte. We were seeing much better employment numbers driving housing and commercial. The I-77 hot lanes, light rail there and apartments are far better than they would've been a year ago. We also continue to see very robust work at Charlotte Douglas Airport. But Kathryn, this is important to North Carolina because the area that had been the sickest for us in many respects has been around the triad, Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, we're seeing good infrastructure work there, in particular the Western loop, which is $100 million job is in that market. We're seeing the Eastern loop coming behind that, 68 connector and seeing a strong subdivision work there. So again an important market for us that's starting to get its legs more slowly than others. But still getting its legs. And then when we come back and take a look at what's going on in Atlanta and we called that out specifically relative to housing and commercial, that's a market that's feeling considerably better than it did a year ago. Not so much, in fairness, on infrastructure, although some of it's better. Of course, the northwest Carter [ph] job went there and that job all by itself is almost as big as the rest of Georgia DOT budget would be. But again, that's a market that saw the private sector just go off the edge. And the private sector in Atlanta has come back very, very nicely. But then as we wrap up and head really more toward Mid-America and Indianapolis in Ohio, Indi for us has been a very good, steady market. And what we like about it is non-res is getting much healthier there. We're looking at Indianapolis as the fifth hottest warehousing area and district in the United States. So when you're adding that commercial component on top of what's been a very steady infrastructure, that's a bit of a change. We're also seeing housing get considerably better in Northern Indianapolis up toward Carmel. And then when we come back and take a look at Ohio, res has gotten much better. There's your delta there. Permits are up 19% in Cincinnati and vacant lots are down 17%. But we also have good infrastructure work on I-70 and I-275. And part of what I really come back at the end of the day and say works well is ready-mix pricing up in that market as much as 6%. So when we're seeing that type of activity, I think when you're seeing ready-mix pricing move in an upward trajectory, that's usually a very good sign for every sector of the market. I apologize for the length of response in that, Katie [ph], but I thought going market by market probably made some sense.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Yes, no, that helps. And I guess this is really a 2-part question, one more directly with pricing, the other somewhat relates to pricing. If you're able, could you parse out on a rough percentage basis how much of pricing the quarter was impacted by geography versus product mix? And then, finally, if you were to look at your markets today versus 5 years ago, how consolidated are your top markets today versus 5 years ago?
C. Howard Nye: I'll let you do the math on the latter part of the question. What I'll say with respect to the geographic and the product mix, I mean, both of those issues, again, were an optical issue going in the quarter and I tried to give some very specific numbers around what we saw, particularly in Texas and Colorado. Okay, if it was same on same, Kathryn, it would have been up 1% or more. I think that's still the best way to think of it.
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes. Kathryn, this is Anne, about, I think it was about 2% with geography, about 1.3%, 1.5% was product, from that average to be just right around 1%, the impact of it.
C. Howard Nye: In fact, 1.8% was geographic and 1.3% was product.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: That's helpful. And the second part of the question, which was I don't if you caught. I had -- my phone cut out, but if you were to look at your overall markets, Martin Marietta today, what percentage are fully consolidated? When I say fully consolidated, you have 3 or 4 players that account for 80-plus percent market share. What is your consolidation today versus the prior peak?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, Kathryn, I think clearly, the industry has seen considerable consolidation since the prior peak. And I think that's a safe observation. I think the other thing that I would ask you to look at and I think it's better for you to look at than for me to opine on is what equals a relevant geographic market, because whether you're moving product by truck, by rail, by boat, by barge or otherwise can impact that pretty considerably as can the barriers to entry, and they're going to vary considerably across markets as well. So I'm going to artfully dodge your question on that at the end of day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Back to pricing for a second, going back a couple of years, 2 or 3 years, there were issues with inventory imbalances in some markets. I'm just wondering where we stand today and whether any issues over inventory imbalances are having a material effect on your pricing outlook for the full year?
C. Howard Nye: The short answer on that is no. They're not having a material impact on pricing for the full year. As you recall, we basically had about 60 million tons that were out there. We pulled that down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Where we were out of balance was on base products. So the fact is, as we see base work go with greater vigor in almost every market that we're in, that goes a long way toward curing the imbalance. But no, we do not see that as a pricing issue, Jack.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. Second question is, in the risks section of the press release, you talk about fiscal issues and risks to transportation budgets and spending. And it mentions North Carolina, which of course is a very important state to you guys. Is there something specific going on there that you see that's changed in the last 3 or 6 months with regard to the outlook in North Carolina for transportation spending?
Anne H. Lloyd: Jack, this is Anne. There's not. I mean, that really we're -- that is a pretty standard issue. As you know, North Carolina disproportionately affects profitability. And so we make sure that we highlight that. And back to our whole commentary as the southeastern corner of the United States begins to recover, then you get a disproportionate impact on profit.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And there's another comment about some markets in the West being now in growth mode when you kind of look at the cycle from bigger picture perspective and we know Texas has been and still is a great market. And I guess you're calling out some improvements in Colorado. Is that where the change is coming in terms of more markets being in growth mode?
C. Howard Nye: I think that's entirely what we are seeing there. I mean, part of what we anticipate in Colorado, for example, Jack, is we're looking to put a midyear price increase in ready-mix in Denver of $6 a cubic yard. That's already be sent to the marketplace. But again, if you're looking at that type of a midyear price increase on ready-mix in a market like Denver, and I think that gives you a pretty good sense of what that growth looks like. And based on a Colorado budget, based on what their RAMP program is doing and based on what the flood relief dollars will look like in that market, we anticipate that market being pretty strong, not for a matter of months but rather for a matter of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Olin of Cleveland Research.
Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company: Just wanted to talk a little bit 2 big picture questions. The first is the TIFIA spending contribution. I guess, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that going forward and how your assets may be positioned. Are you winning some of these projects that are getting released?
C. Howard Nye: Look, I think we look at it the same way we talked about it for a while in that is we think it's going to make a profound difference. We have been disappointed, as I'm sure you have been too, at a pace with which it's come out. Given the pacing at least relative to 2014, we put our plan together as if there would be no TIFIA activity in our plans. So to the extent TIFIA really starts hitting it hard this year, frankly, it will hit it harder next year, it would simply be an upside. I mean here's what we know. Look, all the awards are likely to be done or -- well, they had to be done before the expiration of the highway bill. The total applications right now exceed $51 billion. If we look at the states in which we participate, ongoing applications right now are $18.5 billion. If we look at places that it's been approved, northwest Carter [ph] in Atlanta; downtown Richardson, Kentucky; and The Grand Parkway in Texas, my guess is you're going to see TIFIA dollars go into the hot lanes on I-77 and Charlotte. You're likely to see TIFIA dollars go into the ultimate I-4 in Florida, that's just been let. And again, these are states in which our infrastructure presence tends to be pretty profound. So again, if you're seeing Texas come back with $35 billion with the TIFIA applications, North Carolina over $1 billion and Florida with several billion, with the footprint that we have in those states and our ability to supply, particularly in those granted markets, good quality DOT stone, we feel like it will make a nice difference for us. And again, we feel like we are disproportionately located in areas that will benefit from that. I think whether it's TIFIA or whether it's residential or whether it's non-res, this is a year and I think next year will too where, where you are matters disproportionately. And I think our where is in our favor.
Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company: Good. That is helpful. And then secondly, I know it's somewhat early, but looking at the potential impact of the investment in port capacity, port expansion related to the Panama Canal, I mean, how do you think about that? Do you think you're positioned well? Are you seeing anything?
C. Howard Nye: I do think we're positioned well because, remember, a lot of stone in those markets will end up coming in by rails to different areas. And we're the largest movers -- so if you think about the markets that can be impacted, it's going to be going from South Texas across the gulf and into Florida. And we are, of course, the largest mover of stone by rail on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Union Pacific and the Kansas City Southern, #1 on CSX and #2 on NS. So our ability to move stone to those markets in what we feel like are importantly strategically placed sales yards is very attractive. And of course we're also coming out of Bahamas by boat and Nova Scotia by boat. So our ability to hit it by water and by land is very impressive, and we like where we are there, too.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I'm wondering if you could talk about the, I guess, range of areas where you're putting in an April 1 price increase, if you could just quantify it as what proportion of your served markets and how is that different this year versus last year? It sounds like you may have more gotten more Jan 1 than April 1 increases last year which maybe is driving the variance this quarter. Is that the right, Ward? Can you just frame that for us?
C. Howard Nye: I think the variance for the quarter is really -- it's geography and it's product, Jerry. And I think that was really more the story than anything else. And candidly, I don't think the April to January delta was really that much different this year than last year because it tends to be, oddly enough, in more the cold-weather states anyway. So at the end of the day, I'm not sure really going in April puts you behind in any meaningful way. So I continue to believe the pricing story this quarter is just what we've outlined. It's a mix issue on both sides of the mix debate.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And you've outlined a pickup in the Southeast would be pretty positive from a mix standpoint. Can you just talk about the lead times that you see in your business by each of your 3 reported geographies? Are you seeing that manifest itself in the backlog? Do you have more visibility in that market than the 2 other reported regions?
C. Howard Nye: I think we are clearly having more visibility into a res market, because there is a res market now. And we're having more visibility into a non-res market. I think both of those. And now I'm not necessarily talking about reporting units; I'm just talking broadly geographically. I think both of those are much clearer and better for us now in the Southeastern United States, and by that I mean Virginia all the way through to Carolinas and into Georgia and Alabama, than it's been for a while. We also are not seeing anything that feels like it's taking a step backward in any of those states relative to infrastructure either and I think that's an important piece of it. So as we're looking at what's going on in those states in our business, really across the board, it feels considerably better. I think part of what I've been particularly moved by as we come back and take a look at Florida, which was such a tough state for everybody through the downturn. I mean, right now, Florida is #4 in the United States on pure growth that it's seeing. And Governor Rick Scott has just announced an $8.8 billion DOT budget for fiscal year '15 and they have also just finished awarding the ultimate I-4 bid in Seminole County to the Skanska Granite and Lane [ph] team. That's a $2.3 billion project that they'll get a notice to proceed on later this summer. I mean, that's the type of visibility that we're seeing on res, non-res and these large infrastructure projects in that part of the world that we haven't seen for a while, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And you mentioned you're shipping on any day that you could in the first quarter and you still had really excellent year-over-year volume performance. I'm wondering if the momentum is continuing to a similar extent in 2Q. Could you see double-digit volume growth in 2Q in this business based on what you're seeing today?
C. Howard Nye: Well, I would tell you all about Q2 when we come back at half year. But again, we've talked about momentum building from Q4 into Q1. So I think the primary swing factor is going to be what either does happen or doesn't happen in Washington D.C. If Washington doesn't get in the way, I think it could be pretty impressive.
Anne H. Lloyd: So and just a reminder, we have -- the second quarter 2013 volumes were down almost 2%, and they picked up pretty strong in April but then deteriorated very quickly in May and June, so -- because of the rain we had last year. So the comps in the second quarter, assuming we have a normal spring as opposed to a rainy, rainy spring, are pretty helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Real quick, Ward. I think you were saying that you expect a geographic shift as we go throughout the year, which you mentioned will help to bridge that gap on overall pricing. And then also, Anne, you touched on Southeast markets, and North Carolina having disproportionate impact to profits. With your outlook for kind of a geographic mix shift here kind of as we look in the next few quarters, how should we be thinking about the impact to incremental margins in that scenario?
C. Howard Nye: Clearly, it's going to be very kind to incremental margins in that scenario. The fact is, if we go back and take a look at what incremental margins are, really just for the aggregates product line, if we go back and really normalize for that $5 million of extra expense that we felt like we had because of the extraordinary weather, I mean, the odd thing is even with a pretty challenged volume quarter, what I'll tell you is we comfortably outperformed the target that we have out there for incremental margins. So we feel pretty good about it and, again, that's just normalizing for the $5 million, Trey.
Anne H. Lloyd: And Trey, we've said incremental margins we think are in the 60% on average, which means that those markets in that southeastern quadrant of the U.S. likely have incrementals in excess of that.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. That's encouraging. Lastly, res strength that you're seeing, Ward, it's kind of what we've seen from the builders and starts and orders have kind of been kind of lackluster the last few months at least. And it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of a different story here. Is that more of the, what you're seeing, more of the infrastructure side of res, like the streets and the sidewalks within the new neighborhood? Or more of the kind of leading indicator to starts type work? Or is this just your typical slabs, driveways, that sort of thing?
C. Howard Nye: Trey, I think it's better across the entire spectrum and we are seeing more subdivisions. So are lots being built out? Yes. And we saw some of that last year. Are we now seeing more subdivisions? I think the answer to that is yes too. Here's where I think the difference is on housing. We are back to that notion we discussed before about being where you are. If I look at Denver, housing is good in Denver, and it's going to stay good in Denver. Housing is really attractive in DFW, it's attractive in San Antonio, it's attractive in Houston, it's recovering in Atlanta, it's nice in Charlotte, it's recovering in Raleigh. That's the March that we had. I think if we had a much more Midwest/Northeast-based business, we would probably have a very different story. So I think on the story on housing and frankly on non-res I think that Southeast/Southwest predominant footprint right now is our friend. I think that's the delta in the story.
Anne H. Lloyd: Trey, I think if you listen closely to the mortgage lenders and home builders, they will echo a very similar finding, that it really is a very regional market right now. Fortunately, we're in those regions that are seeing the improvement.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Good. And I do have one last one if I could slip it in. Ward, on your mention earlier of a lot of base rock in the mix. You said that seems to be a good indicator of new work starting. But what is the typical lag between seeing the increase in base rock like we did in 1Q, the lag before it starts to shift to the work that is behind it as you said that would likely be higher ASP rock?
C. Howard Nye: And I think it's going to vary by what the end use is. If it's going to an infrastructure job that's a big new job, it's going to be longer than it's going to be if it's going to a non-res job. So again, if you come back and take a look at how nicely non-res moved, those projects tend to be of shorter duration. You will see the base rock go down, you will see the clean stone come back on top of it, all very much typically within a construction season or maybe within a quarter or 2. So I think the fact that you're seeing non-res move actually in a very positive fashion is more helpful toward compression -- compressing the time constraint that you're talking about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I was hoping to ask you a question on the Western region. Volume was up 21%, 22%. And Ward, that was really helpful, the laundry list of items that you kind of walked through. But few of those numbers struck me as being even at 20%. So is that an apples-to-apples number? Is that organic growth? Are there a couple onetime projects? I know you talked about strength in Texas and Colorado in energy. But I'm just trying to help square up 21.5% growth.
C. Howard Nye: Ted, it's all apples to apples, and there is nothing particularly special in there other than I think really watching nice South Texas, good San Antonio, good Houston, much improved DFW. And then coming back to it just being a much better business year-over-year in Colorado. I think Colorado was really the sleeper because the notion I think that a lot of the people had is it's winter, it's snowing and not much is going to happen there. And we actually saw very attractive activity there. I mean, we're seeing ready-mix numbers nicely up year-over-year. We're seeing asphalt numbers nicely up year-over-year and aggregates as well. So I think it's pretty much across the spectrum in that market.
Anne H. Lloyd: Ted, we're -- I think we're seeing backlogs there 3 and 4x above this time prior year.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: It's up 3 or 4x in South Texas?
Anne H. Lloyd: So generally in that group, not specific region, but in that group.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then you mentioned that one of the keys to hitting the pricing target will be an improvement in Mid-America. Could you just talk about which states in particular you need to see that kind of that improvement to kind of realize the mix we're looking for?
C. Howard Nye: Look, I think if we see what we believe we're going to see North Carolina, with Charlotte having the type of recovery it's having, with the type of infrastructure work that we're seeing in Greensboro, with the improving economy that we're seeing in Raleigh East, clearly, North Carolina is going to be a disproportionate driver in that marketplace. And again, in what we're seeing in North Carolina right now, it feels pretty good to us.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. That's great. The last thing I was hoping to ask you is, Anne, you're always kind enough to give us kind of an EBITDA bridge, walk through the headwinds and tailwinds, I know you mentioned weather as being a $5 million headwind is the estimate. But could we just walk through that bridge and I'll jump back in queue there?
Anne H. Lloyd: Absolutely. For the aggregates product line, that's excluding the vertical businesses, volume contributed -- I'm rounding these numbers, volume contributed $17 million, pricing took away $1 million, cost increases took away $8 million, $5 million of that was weather. Our vertical businesses improved close to $4.5 million. Specialty Products was down about $1 million, mostly natural gas and weather-related. And then the corporate line was about $1.5 million. That's your bridge.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then just so we understand, how do you calculate the $5 million weather? Or just how you come up with that proxy?
Anne H. Lloyd: We actually look at the production cost increase that occurred just -- with market by market working with our teams there locally. We also -- and principally, what was happening is, normally, during a cold winter, you don't do a lot of production. We had some markets where regardless of whether they wanted to do production or not, they needed to, to be able to be ready for the backlog and to meet the shipment demand. So your cost of doing business and operating in that extremely cold weather increase. So that was part of it. We also looked at projects that were deferred into the second quarter and looked at that impact on both the profitability and cost structure. So we just did a market-by-market build.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then the last thing is just production volumes. Were production volumes up year-on-year or sequentially?
C. Howard Nye: They were actually down year-over-year. They were down about 2.4% so production was 23.8 million tons versus 24.4 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Ward, your comments about some of the states taking a more cautious approach toward kind of project commitments on the public sector side. It wasn't clear to me, have you seen the impact of that in some of those markets in terms of release of new work or is this kind of more of an expectation in the coming months?
C. Howard Nye: We have not seen it. It's something that they have said that they may be thinking about in the coming months. And here's the odd component of it. For example, one of the states that has said it is Colorado. If we go back to some of the comments that I shared with you, we're seeing so much private work in Colorado right now. Number one, we're not sure if they are going to have a slowdown. If they did have a slowdown, I don't think it affects us in that state in any meaningful way. So I think from the perspective of having caution out there, it's important for us to articulate to you that DOTs have said that. At the same time, when we come back and look at different marketplaces, the private side is so strong right now. I'm not sure that it's going to be particularly moving in a negative way for us in the states that are more impactful.
Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then this might be a little bit more difficult to answer at this stage, but I'll ask anyway. Any view on the kind of proposed Lafarge combination and in particular, what could be implications to MLM down the road within any adjacent markets you guys compete in?
C. Howard Nye: I'll probably just take a pass on that. But what I'll say is, clearly, I think there will be some overlap in some discrete markets in the United States. They're probably more concerned in other markets around the world, including Canada. So we'll see what comes out of that. But at the same time, we're a company that's always looking to responsibly grow its footprint, and you know what our style is, so if there's opportunity there, we would certainly like to be a part of it.
Operator: Our final question comes from Sam Dubinsky of Wells Fargo.
Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of housekeeping ones. Shipments went up 8% in Q1, but you saw a 13% increase in March. How much of that 13% increase do you think is pent up demand from weather improving versus organic growth? And maybe could you comment on how April is shaping out?
C. Howard Nye: What we -- we'll tell you more about April later in the year. And look, I think if you really look at it, weather, I think, clearly had an impact in certain parts of the country where it was just bitterly cold. I mean, to put no finer point on it, they had a frost in parts of the Midwest that went down deeper than 3 feet if you can even imagine that. So work in really an Omaha or a Des Moines was going to be very difficult to get. Work in Texas, because weather permitted it, worked pretty well. And work in Colorado, when it was clear, worked pretty well. So I do think, again, back to the word that we used before, there was momentum coming out of Q4. And I think January and February just really were what they were.
Anne H. Lloyd: Sam, we actually saw volume growth each month during the quarter. It accelerated as we got to March, but that is not uncommon.
C. Howard Nye: So if you look at it, January was up actually 2%, February was up for us 8% and March was up 13.4%. So to Anne's point, it was a slow, steady build and not really that big of a surprise.
Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And just my last question is, and I know you talked about, I think, 60% incremental margins, but if we were to sort of extrapolate this year's growth in volumes, and let's say we get somewhere halfway between now and sort of the last peak cycle, where do you think cost per ton is? Do you think it would be comparable or has there been any escalators over the past several years in the cost side?
C. Howard Nye: With cost per ton, if we have that kind of volume recovery, it's actually going to be pretty attractive because we're not going to add a lot of headcount to it. And remember, that's going to be 25% of your cost of goods sold. So if you go back to that notion of recovering half the volume that we've lost, and keep in mind, if we did that, that's 40 million tons of stone. Look, if we pick up 40 million tons of stone on the cost profile that we have today, the cost per ton is going to be going nicely down. And what I would tell you under that kind of volume recovery, I think the average selling price is going to be a great story again, too.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for any further remarks.
C. Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. We are committed to executing our strategic initiatives and increasing long-term shareholder value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in July. Have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call and webcast announcing the planned combination of Martin Marietta and Texas Industries. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and a copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of martinmarietta.com and txi.com. An audio archive of this call will be available shortly after the call has concluded. At this time, I would like the turn the call over to Ward Nye, Martin Marietta's President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
C. Howard Nye: Laurie, thank you very much. And good morning, everyone and thank you, all, for joining us on short notice for this announcement. Our planned combination with Texas Industries creates an expanded platform for growth that will benefit shareholders of both companies. Joining me today are Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mel Brekhus, Texas Industries' President and Chief Executive Officer. In a few moments I'll provide the high-level details about the transaction and then Mel will share his perspective and discuss the significant benefits he sees for Texas Industries' shareholders in this combination. Anne and I will then talk in more detail about the strategic rationale and financial benefits. And we'll also spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter 2014 (sic) [ 2013 ] earnings results, which we also issued this morning. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in Martin Marietta and Texas Industries' most earnings releases and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Moving on to the announcement. Slide 5 outlines at a high level the compelling strategic and financial benefits of this transaction and makes clear how the combination of our 2 companies creates an expanded platform for growth. Together, we'll create the leading U.S. aggregates producer, enhanced by a targeted cement presence. The combined company will have nationwide scale and enhanced geographic and product diversity. We'll be well positioned for long-term growth with uniquely positioned assets, including our best-in-class long-haul network providing us expanded reach into the largest and fastest-growing geographies in the United States, including Texas and California. Furthermore, by vertically integrating across aggregates and targeted cement operations, we'll be able to leverage the complementary high-quality assets of both companies and enhance our position as low-cost and highly efficient operators. The combined company will have a disciplined management team, a strong balance sheet, enhanced financial flexibility and better access to capital, which should fuel our long-term growth as we experience rapidly improving market conditions. All of these benefits, combined with the synergies we expect to achieve from the combination, provide a unique opportunity to create significant value for both sets of shareholders. Turning to Slide 6, you'll see an overview of the terms of the transaction. Under the merger agreement, Martin Marietta will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Texas Industries common stock in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Based on the closing market prices for the shares of both companies on January 27, 2014, and their debt levels as of December 31, 2013, the combined company will have an enterprise value of approximately $8.5 billion. Texas Industries' shareholders will receive 0.7 Martin Marietta shares for each share of Texas Industries common stock they own at closing. Based on the closing stock price for Martin Marietta on January 27, 2014, this consideration would be equivalent to $71.95 of Martin Marietta stock for each Texas Industries share. The exchange ratio represents a 13% premium to the average exchange ratio implied by the closing prices of Martin Marietta's and Texas Industries' shares during the last 90 days and an over 15% premium to the exchange ratio implied by the respective closing stock prices on December 12, 2013, the day prior to market speculation of a potential transaction. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2014, subject to shareholder votes by both Martin Marietta and Texas Industries shareholders, as well as customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. An important element of this transaction involves voting agreements with 2 of Texas Industries' largest shareholders, representing approximately 51% of shares outstanding, who have agreed to vote all of their shares of Texas Industries common stock in favor of the transaction. We are pleased to have their strong support. Upon closing, Martin Marietta shareholders are expected to own approximately 69%, and Texas Industries shareholders are expected to own approximately 31% of the combined company. We'll operate under the name Martin Marietta Materials and will be headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina and we'll maintain a significant presence in Dallas. I, along with the rest of the Martin Marietta executive management team, will lead the combined company. We'll retain top talent across the combined company based on a best-athlete approach. In addition, Mel Brekhus, Texas Industries' President and CEO, has agreed to work constructively with us to ensure an orderly transition and smooth integration. As you'll see on Slide 7, we're bringing together 2 highly complementary companies, both in terms of geographies, products and areas of expertise. We're combining strong aggregates and heavy building materials franchises that, together, can achieve greater scale and efficiencies to deliver value. As the #2 producer of aggregates for highway, infrastructure, commercial and residential construction in the United States, Martin Marietta supplies the crushed stones, sand and gravel used to build the roads, sidewalks and foundations on which Americans live. With our Aggregates business accounting for approximately 88% of Martin Marietta's annual net sales; and our Specialty Products business representing nearly 12%, we produce about 128 million tons of aggregates per year to 35 states across the country. Texas Industries is the #1 cement producer by capacity in Texas and #3 in California. Importantly, Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high-growth markets that fit well in our existing portfolio. It offers 7.4 million tons of cement capacity and over 100 ready-mix plants, which will further diversify Martin Marietta's product and customer mix. Mel will discuss the significant investments in plant modernization and capacity expansion that Texas Industries has undertaken throughout the last decade. With these key strategic decisions, Texas Industries has achieved leading positions in some of the nation's highest growth markets while maintaining a low-cost profile. As a result of this combination, we'll create a market-leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials that's poised to capitalize on the strength of our combined aggregates platform, as well as the significant upside potential in both the residential and nonresidential construction markets. We're excited about the potential of joining forces with Texas Industries and look forward to quickly realizing the benefits of this transaction. With that said, I'd like now to turn the call over to Mel, to discuss why TXI decided to partner with Martin Marietta. Mel?
Melvin G. Brekhus: All right. Thank you, Ward. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to thank Ward and his team for all the hard work that they've done. But more importantly, the collaborative work that they've done that has helped us bring this potential merger together. And we will continue to operate collaboratively and enthusiastically to see this merger through. But if you will please look at Slide 9. You will see the strategic evolution that we have taken at TXI to position the company as a leader in our markets. Since 2001, Texas Industries has expanded its operations and grown by, among other things, investing over $1 billion in cement plant modernization and capacity expansion ahead of increased demand and more stringent regulations. We have replaced 2.3 million tons of older, less efficient clinker capacity and increased clinker capacity by approximately 3.5 million tons. We've made these strategic investments in order to further enhance our reputation as a low-cost producer with state-of-the-art facilities and to get us to where we are today. We believe this combination with Martin Marietta represents another step forward for Texas Industries, as we seek to continuously improve our business and maximize value for our shareholders. If you'd please turn to Slide 9. As one entity, Martin Marietta and Texas Industries will benefit from increased scale and scope, a more diversified portfolio of products and significant exposure to the attractive aggregates business. We've long admired Martin Marietta's success and strong execution track record and we believe the combination provides opportunities for significant value creation. As Slide 9 further outlines, this stock-for-stock transaction will provide our shareholders with a tax-free exchange and allow them to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company, including the synergies that have been identified. Additionally, by being part of a larger organization, the combined company will have greater financial flexibility and a stronger balance sheet, allowing us to provide meaningful dividends to Texas Industries shareholders and deliver a solid platform for sustainable growth. Texas Industries' board ran a thorough and robust process, evaluated available options and concluded that the combination with Martin Marietta fulfilled our goals. We are confident that this is the best outcome for our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, our vendors and, of course, our shareholders. I am very proud of what we have done here at Texas Industries. As we look forward to this combination, I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions that have made this announcement possible. As I opened my remarks, I once again say, I look forward to working together with Ward and the rest of Martin Marietta management team to support this combination and to ensure a successful integration. I believe the next chapter of our company will be a great one. Thank you, Ward, and I'll turn it back to you.
C. Howard Nye: Mel, thank you very much and I really appreciate your kind comments and the way that your team has approached this. I think we really have done something together that's in the best interest of our collective shareholders, customers and employees. And I wholly agree with your sentiment and we're looking forward to joining forces. Taking a look at Slide 12. I want to spend a few minutes now explaining in greater detail why this transaction is right from both a strategic and financial perspective, and the substantial benefits it offers to both companies' shareholders. As you can see on Slide 12, this combination allows Martin Marietta to continue delivering on its strategic principles of positioning, growth and performance. We want to be positioned in the most attractive markets, leveraging multiple long-term drivers of growth and continue to differentiate our performance from all others in the industry. We believe the combination with Texas Industries lines up with each of these principles and represents a very attractive investment for our shareholders. As you can see on Slide 13, Martin Marietta is geographically diverse with respect to its net sales. Texas, one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, already accounts for approximately 17% of Martin Marietta's net sales; while North Carolina and Georgia, which are in the early stages of economic recovery, account for about 19% of net sales. Importantly, Texas Industries supports our already strong position in Texas and provides a presence in the rapidly recovering California market. Combined with established positions in key geographies, this will lead to nearly $2.5 billion in combined sales. Slide 14 shows the combined companies' pro forma position in the Aggregates business. Last year, Martin Marietta produced 128 million tons of sand, gravel and crushed stone, making us the second-largest producer of aggregates in the country and the third-largest shipper. Combining our aggregates operations with Texas Industries, which shipped approximately 15 million tons in fiscal year 2013, the combined company would have been the pro forma #1 producer of aggregates in the United States last year. In addition, Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high-growth markets in Texas, which highly complement our existing portfolio. As I said before, and as illustrated on the next slide, Slide 15, vertical integration will drive value creation in selective markets. The combined company will be focused on the key benefits available from operating in aggregates, as well as cement and ready-mix, and we're confident we'll deliver value from this enhanced vertical integration. Turning to Slide 16. As Mel mentioned, one of the exciting benefits of this transaction comes with the work that Texas Industry has already done to improve its facilities and ensure their compliance with both federal and state environmental regulations. According to the Portland Cement Association, or PCA, under current environmental regulations, there are 18 cement facilities forecasted to be closed and 7 designated for permanent closure. Additionally, there are 3 more facilities that are at high risk for closure. Combined, these facilities represent 19.3 million tons of U.S. clinker production capacity expected to be removed from the U.S. market. Texas Industries' recently upgraded and expanded facilities could be the last commissioned for the foreseeable future in the California market. Whether or not all of those other facilities close remains to be seen. However, no matter the ultimate outcome, we expect that the combined company will be uniquely well positioned in California. Growth is another of our strategic principles, and Slide 17 demonstrates the planned combination increases our exposure to some of the country's most attractive high-growth markets. In total, the combined company will be uniquely situated with top markets and states that account for approximately 70% of projected U.S. population growth between 2012 and 2017. Martin Marietta is strategically located in Texas, as well as other high-growth states across the Southeast and in other growing markets, while Texas Industries is strategically located in Texas and California. Moving to Slide 18. You can see why we are so enthusiastic about our pro forma position in Texas. Texas is the #1 consumer of aggregates and cement in the United States, and the combined Texas operations you see illustrated in Slide 18 will represent 34% of pro forma sales in the combined company. The company will have an unmatched asset base in key markets in Texas, including Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin. Our optimism is supported by analyst expectations that Texas will expand at an above-average pace in 2014 and beyond, supported by broad-based economic drivers, including housing and nonresidential construction, energy and related manufacturing. As you see on Slide 19, the PCA reports that Texas demand for cement currently exceeds capacity, and that gap is only expected to grow over the next 4 years. Texas Industries maintains a leadership position in the state and we believe the combined company will be well positioned to serve this key market. With this combination, Martin Marietta will once again gain access to California, which we believe is at the early stages of a significant recovery. Slide 20 details many of the reasons we believe in the potential of this market. The state is the eighth largest economy in the world and it is the #2 consumer of both aggregates and cement in the U.S. construction, behind only Texas. Between 2013 and 2017, PCA projects a compound annual growth rate in Southern California's cement consumption of 13.4%, and a 12.5% compound annual growth rate in Northern California over the same period. Anne is now going to take us through the financial benefits of this planned combination. So with that, we'll turn it to Anne.
Anne H. Lloyd: Thank you, Ward. Ward has talked about positioning and growth, and we will now focus on how this planned combination also delivers against performance, one of our key strategic principles. On Slide 21, I want to begin with a high-level overview of the significant financial benefits that this combination will provide shareholders. Importantly, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to Martin Marietta's earnings per share in 2014, assuming refinancing of Texas Industries' outstanding debt at/or around closing of the merger and excluding one-time costs. In the first full year of ownership, EPS accretion is expected to reach mid- to high-single digits. The combination will also provide meaningful additional growth opportunities that will drive revenue and EBITDA growth in excess of stand-alone projections. As I will outline on the next slide, taking into consideration the benefits from acquired net operating losses, as well as noncore real estate and synergies that we are confident we can bring to bear, we believe the run rate multiple of this proposed transaction will be inside 8x EBITDA within 24 months of closing. Finally, the combination will also help Martin Marietta increase our return on invested capital over the next several years, particularly as run rate synergies take hold. As outlined on Slide 22, we expect to achieve $70 million of annual synergies by calendar year 2017. Through a nearly even split of SG&A savings and operational efficiencies, including incremental aggregates volume, incremental cement volume, ready-mix improvement and purchasing. This translates into $28 million in run rate synergies at calendar year-end 2014, representing 40% of total projected annual synergies. That number jumps to $57 million in run rate synergies or approximately 80% of total projected synergies through calendar year 2015. Our estimates exclude material real estate sales and any potential utilization of net operating losses, which I will highlight next. From a balance sheet perspective, Slide 23 outlines our industry-leading leverage position. Both companies have undrawn credit facilities and there are no significant debt maturities until 2018. From a market perspective, we expect the combined company will maintain strong existing credit ratings and have pro forma leverage of less than 3x EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Furthermore, we have an opportunity to immediately reduce the cost of debt on Texas Industries' existing $650 million in notes. The combined company's financial strength and balance sheet structure, combined with further action to reduce the cost of capital, will help us retain significant financial flexibility for continued growth. We expect to rapidly delever the combined company, driven in part by utilization of TXI's NOL, totaling over $400 million on a pretax basis as of May 31, 2013. We expect full utilization of these NOLs over the next few years. In addition, we have identified nonoperating real estate assets that we may divest. Finally, on Slide 24, we outline the ability of this leadership team to reduce cost and maintain a lean cost structure going forward. We believe this proven track record will be critical as we work to integrate our operations and achieve the expected synergies from this transaction. Further, we have supported value creation by maintaining a stable dividend program, even as the economy experienced the worst downturn in recent history. We look forward to providing the same dividend to Texas Industries shareholders and see that as another key benefit of the combination. Before we conclude, I want to take a minute to discuss our earnings results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2013, which we also announced this morning. In the interest of time, we're going to keep our remarks about earnings concise. I refer you to our separately issued press release for additional detail, including commentary on trends and developments in our market. We reported fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 67% over the prior year quarter. Consistent with the trends experienced throughout 2013, our results reflect private-sector construction growth, pricing improvement in the aggregates product line and exceptional performance from the Specialty Products business. These drivers generated an 8% increase in consolidated net sales which, coupled with our disciplined cost management, led to an incremental consolidated gross margins for the quarter of 69%. Further, these factors contributed to a 380 basis point improvement in our consolidated gross margin. The Aggregates business reported a 7% increase in net sales over the prior year quarter. Aggregates product line pricing, which increased 3.4% despite headwinds created by product mix, was a significant driver of this sales growth. Please refer to our press release for additional details on aggregate volume, pricing and margin. Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance and delivers quarterly records for both net sales and earnings from operations. Net sales of $58.1 million created -- increased 15% over the prior year quarter. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2014 outlook.
C. Howard Nye: Anne, thanks for that. Looking ahead to full year 2014, we continue to be encouraged by positive trends in our business end markets, especially the private-sector employment and construction. We anticipate growth across the nonresidential, residential and public sector and ChemRock and Rail end markets in 2014, as highlighted in our Q4 2013 earnings press release. Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 5% compared with 2013. We also expect aggregates product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013, although this increase will not be uniform across the company. Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013. Net sales for the Specialty Product segment should range from $225 million to $235 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit. To conclude, we are encouraged by numerous macroeconomic indicators of increased construction activity for 2014. We believe the private sector will continue the strong growth noted in 2013, which should lead to increased public-sector activity. Additionally, we expect the trend of increased state-level funding of key projects to continue during the period of federal funding uncertainty. We're well positioned to serve these opportunities, to build on our momentum and enhance long-term value for our shareholders. Before taking your questions, let's quickly discuss the map to completing this compelling transaction on 28. Moving forward, we'll file the appropriate materials with the SEC and work cooperatively to receive the requisite rules to file definitive materials and schedule the shareholder votes. As mentioned earlier, both Martin Marietta and Texas Industries will seek shareholder approval, and we've already received voting agreements from Texas Industries' 2 largest shareholders, constituting 51% of shares outstanding. Along the way, we'll work to obtain customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions necessary to complete the combination. Throughout the process, we'll also do our best to ensure a smooth transition for our stakeholders and it will be business as usual for all Martin Marietta and Texas Industries customers. Moving to Slide 29. I want to conclude our call by reiterating how truly excited we are about this value-creating strategic combination, which we strongly believe is in the best interest of all Martin Marietta and Texas Industries stakeholders. The combined company will provide significant shareholder value, benefit our talented employees and lead to enhanced offerings for our customers. We look forward to becoming a market-leading supplier of aggregates, cement and heavy building materials with a nationwide scale and enhanced geographic and product diversity and to capitalizing on this unique opportunity to create value for both sets of shareholders. Thank you, all, again for joining us today to discuss this announcement. We look forward to working with the Texas Industries team to complete the combination. I'll now turn it back over to Laurie to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Chris Olin of Cleveland Research.
Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company: I wanted to just start with your demand guidance. And I understand kind of how you get to the overall number. But I was just wondering, if you look at this public demand driver, I guess you're guiding closer to low-single-digit range. Is there a way you could look at it by region? And I guess I'm getting at, is the outlook muted because of kind of your concerns in the Midwest?
C. Howard Nye: Chris, here's how I think about it. Let's go through end use. I would look at infrastructure and say that we're looking for slight growth in infrastructure next year. I think we're going to see, obviously, more of the TIFIA money coming through. I think that's going to be very helpful. If you look at the states in which Martin Marietta has a significant presence, I think we see good activity in Texas, we see great activity in Colorado, very steady activity in Iowa, and we see growing activity in the Eastern United States. In nonresidential, again, we see that up mid- to high-single-digit growth next year. We think that continues to be a pull behind what we've seen in energy and otherwise. But let's remember, we've seen double-digit growth in residential this year. We're seeing that across almost all of our geographies. The usual tale that we would see on nonres coming behind residential has served to be consistent. So if we're looking slight growth in infrastructure, mid- to high-single-digit growth in nonres, double-digit growth in res and low single-digit growth in our ChemRock and Rail segment, that's what leads us up to the 4% to 5% growth. Does that respond to your question, Chris?
Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company: Yes. Yes, that's fair. Also on the pricing, I was curious how much of the pricing outlook is affected by mix? Will it be a considerable headwind?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, I'm not sure there's going to be a huge mix issue relative to next year. I think a lot of it's going to be dependent on how much new construction you see on the infrastructure or on the commercial side. What I would tell you is the more construction we see on commercial, the better. Because that tends to be a higher-priced market area for us. But new construction will take more base and that can be your swing factor relative to mix.
Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company: Okay. Just last question, regarding the deal here. I'm just curious why the interest in cement assets now. I was always under the impression that, that was one of your businesses that you were less interested in. I was just curious if you had any thoughts behind that.
C. Howard Nye: We are interested in markets that we think are going to be attractive near term and long term. And I'll tell you, somebody commented to me one time that they thought Texas was going to be one of the great countries to do business in over the next 20 years and we think that's entirely right. And we think combining these businesses and having that type of leading position in a state and in a geography that we think is going to be extremely exciting is the right way forward. So what we're looking for in this, Chris, is just what you would imagine. We're looking to build value.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Just as a quick follow-up. People that have owned Martin Marietta stock have been very interested in the Aggregates business. And clearly, as you highlighted in this presentation, this diversifies you. It makes you more vertically integrated. When you look forward, can you give us a better feel or a sense for how you think about the percentage of earnings coming from Aggregates itself versus downstream operations might be? And how -- well, let me start with that and then I'll follow up.
C. Howard Nye: That's fine, Arnie. What I'll tell you this is an aggregate-centric company. Let there be no mistake about that. What we've talked about is market positions where we're 1 or 2, and market positions where we feel like we need to be positioned for continuing growth. And if we're looking at a market like Texas, we felt like this was an important structure for us to have in that market. But if you come back and take a look at the pro forma business, it is still a very aggregate-centric business and I expect it will continue to be that and grow. Keep in mind, it's an aggregate-centric business with the Eastern U.S. and the Southeast business still down. So as we continue to see places like North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia go through recovery, what you're going to see from a percentage of earnings perspective will continue to be an aggregates-driven business.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: As a follow-up to that, your operating margins in the Southeast have been higher than your gross margins in the West. Obviously, with dramatically higher exposure to the west, how should we think about your outlook for margins in the next year or 2 on a consolidated basis?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, you will clearly see margin growth in this business as we see aggregate volume come back to the business. You can take a look at what we put up for the quarter. And part of what I'm concerned about is a spectacular fourth quarter is going to be lost somewhere in this news of a spectacular transaction, as well. When you look at the 69% that we put to the bottom line in the quarter that tells you what we're doing in a period of time that, frankly, we didn't get a lot of volume help. We've got some pricing help. But we did get some help from other parts of the country. Again, Southeast, North Carolina, in particular, that really helped drive that business, Arnie. So if we can put that type of incremental margin up in a flat-volume environment, you can imagine what's going to happen when the volume hits, and the volume's coming.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Again, if I can just clarify. Think you mentioned that -- appears you're paying about a 20 multiple on current EBITDA. But I think in the prepared remarks, you indicated on an adjusted basis, looking out 18 to 24 months that drops to about 8? Is that correct?
Anne H. Lloyd: That's correct. Our run rate multiple is inside of 8x within 24 months of closing, assuming that we deliver on the synergies, utilize NOLs and then maximize the value of the real estate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Just first, a basic question on the structure of the deal. Why all equity and why no debt included as part of this transaction?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, it made good sense for us from a Martin Marietta perspective. It keeps our balance sheet in good shape. As you can see, we delevered through this in a very attractive way. I'll let Mel respond from his shareholders' perspective in a moment, but I think the tax-free nature of the deal makes a lot of sense. The other thing that it does, Kathryn, is it keeps this combined entity in a very attractive place to continue to look to grow strategically and do bolt-on acquisitions. Again, you know what our long-term strategic plan has been. And this is exactly what we're doing. What we're announcing today is consistent with what we've been talking about since 2010, when we pulled our strategic plan together. But, Mel, I'll let you take the other half of that, if you will.
Melvin G. Brekhus: Yes, Kathryn, I would echo what Ward said. And I want you to understand and others to understand that, from our perspective, with this stock-for-stock tax-free transaction, we get a very fair value for what we have built over time and especially the last 10 or 12 years. But more importantly, our shareholders get an opportunity to share in a value enhancement that will occur as we move forward. And that's really exciting to me and to our board and, I hope, to our shareholders.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: So with that in mind, you made some comment about keeping some dry powder essentially for bolt-on acquisitions. Does this take out the possibility of repurchasing your own stock at some point in time in the next 12 to 18 months?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, I won't speak necessarily to definitive time tables but I'll tell you what I said to you before, depending on where we are from a leverage perspective and otherwise. Look, we like Martin Marietta a lot. We know what we're getting when we buy that business as well. But if we have the opportunity to go and do some very sensible bolt-on acquisitions that will make sense for this business, not just 1 or 2 years but truly generationally, that's the type of value that we're going to be aiming for, Kathryn.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay. Is this also a beginning of a focused West Coast expansion effort? Or is this more of a one-off? Maybe -- because you picked up the Colorado asset as part of the asset swap. You're now increasing exposure in Texas and gaining a foothold in California. Maybe discuss a little bit more about your Western expansion efforts?
C. Howard Nye: Really, our Western expansion efforts are consistent what we've done in the East, Kathryn, and that is we're looking for leading positions. And what we're doing with this transaction in Texas is truly putting a stake in the ground on a wholly leading position in a host of different markets, including where we sit in Dallas/Fort Worth and giving us a nice entry to Austin, as well. I think you've actually been out and seen those Denver operations. We took down a formidable presence along the front range and what this does for us in California, honestly, it gives us optionality. That's the primary principle that I would outline to you. We have optionality in California on growing that business or doing other things with that business as well. And we're going to have our eyes wide open. The primary thing that we want to do, Kathryn, is build value for shareholders and we believe we can do that. I think we've done it very effectively in Colorado. I know we'll do it effectively in Texas and we're going to see exactly how we want to go ahead and move forward with a number of very attractive options in California.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: And with the California assets, would you be willing to JV the cement ops in order to pick up aggregate assets?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, I'm not going to lay out all the different cards that spell out what our strategic options are, but there are many. And we are -- we like to think we're creative people and I'm confident we will find a good solution one way or the other with California.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Okay. And finally, and I'll get back in the queue. Could you give a little bit more color on the asset sales, the properties? It may be too early to say what the potential incremental value is, but just helping us get a sense of the relative magnitude. Is this more like a $100 million-type transaction or a $300 million or $500 million-type transaction?
Anne H. Lloyd: Kathryn, it's not $300 million or $500 million. It's probably in the $100 million range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: So, Ward, you gave us some volume and pricing guidance for the stand-alone Martin Marietta for '14, as you always do. Can you give us any metrics on kind of what you expect for the TXI business, as we look into calendar '14? And as you guys expect it to be pretty quickly accretive?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, obviously, I think you could take a look at those Texas markets and California and probably get a better feel for that. We're in a funny place right now because, I think, coming out and giving specifics on TXI business, is really not where I need to be as we're sitting here at this moment. But I think if you go back and take a look at what's happened this past year in DFW, what's anticipated with heavy highway work there, what's going on with population demographics in DFW and what appears to be a very strong return in California, I think directionally, all those markets look very, very attractive. And I did say in my prepared remarks that you're looking at a market that many are anticipating will be sold out from a cement perspective. So I'm not trying to be clever on it, Trey. I just -- from that perspective, I'm happy to talk specifically about Martin Marietta but talk about trends relative to TXI. And the trends for both are outstanding.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then also on -- can you give us -- and maybe this is for Anne, what NOL value you're assuming to get to the 8x EBITDA multiple within 24 months? And also if you could, give us some ideas of assumptions in terms of cash flow that you're getting in that math as well?
Anne H. Lloyd: Trey, once again, I think it's a little early to be giving guidance in that regard. But as I indicated in our opening remarks, we think the NOL value is over $400 million. That would be recognized over the next few years. And obviously, we gave you some indications that we believe that was in -- inside 24 months that we're trading at 8x -- or that the deal would be valued at about an 8x multiple. So that should give you some insight.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then Ward, as you take the reins here, how do you expect to approach additional cement capacity increases in TXI's existing footprint? Specifically, as we look at the Midlothian asset there, that plant and the potential for expansion there?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, again, that's going into some specific asset that Mel and his team still have responsibility for. The one thing I'll tell you, as you think about that market and I alluded to it in my comments, don't forget our long-haul network, Trey, and how important that can be when you tie it back into those cement assets. Again, we're the #1 mover of stone on both BN and UP. And having that type of rail access and a more robust distribution network in Texas, we think really makes that combination awfully exciting.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Congratulations. First question is, Ward, could you let us know on how much of your aggregate assets in Texas now can be consumed internally with the new cement and ready-mix plants you're picking up?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, Garik, that's something in the fullness of time I'm happy to give you much more detail on. But obviously, if you take a look at where our aggregates position is going to be in the DFW market or otherwise, it's going to be very attractive and you'll like the numbers.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then, I guess this is a follow-up on the Texas market. Do you anticipate any sort of HSR risk? Any sort of meaningful asset divestments as a result of combining aggregate or ready-mix forces?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, we obviously look at that issue very, very carefully. We understand the market well. We understand the HSR process well. If we thought there was a serious issue there, we wouldn't be doing what we're doing here this morning.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, is it fair to assume that there may be some assets, though, that would have to be divested?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, as we look at it, we just don't see any material HSR issues and we feel very confident, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, and I guess just my last question is, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the comments around year 1 accretion for 2014 and also in year 1. Is this primarily coming from the anticipated debt refi and the interest expense savings associated with -- I know that you're going to have some cost synergies as well. Is that mainly where the accretion is going to be coming from? Or are you anticipating revenue synergies off the bat coming through as well?
Anne H. Lloyd: So you have, as we indicated, we had a run rate synergies about $28 million through the end of 2014. We do expect the refi will drive a substantial portion of the savings on top of the synergies. And that is -- also, it excludes the one-time cost as you would imagine.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Right. Okay. So it's really coming from refi. If I had a rate quarter, it would be fair to assume refi first and then cost synergies second?
Anne H. Lloyd: That's correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was curious, Ward, when you look at -- I think you listed 8 reasons for the deal in your press release. When you think about those reasons, I was wondering if you could kind of rank the most important to least important or maybe just the top 2 most important reasons for the transaction. Because when I think about it, it doesn't seem to me that, just alone being the largest aggregate producer really gives you any real benefits being close second or close third. And when I think about the synergy opportunities, those to me don't seem huge, when I think about the combined company being able to generate in excess of probably $1 billion in EBITDA by the targeted timeframe.
C. Howard Nye: You know what, Garik, I guess my...
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: It's Adam Rudiger.
C. Howard Nye: Adam, I'm sorry. Adam, my comment would be that the aim isn't about being the biggest. The aim is about being the absolute best. And what I believe is having these market positions in Texas and California and then using the optionality that we have in California to drive our business, if we need to, in other directions, we think it's really very powerful. I'm not sure that I would rank any of those in any particular order. Again, we have a lot of conviction around the synergies. When you put a multiple to those synergies, it's pretty powerful. And part of what I think we'll be doing, too, is seeing what else we can do with this business once we get it. I think the distribution network is going to be incredibly important to the Aggregates business, as well as to the cement business. And from where we sit, we think there's incredible value that's being built here. And again, my aim is to build the finest aggregates company in the world. If it happens to be one of the biggest, that's great, too. But we're about shareholders.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so it really sounds to me like it's the geographic exposure that really is attractive for you.
C. Howard Nye: That's -- I would certainly agree with that.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then second, just real quick question on the NOLs. Is there any -- are there any issues with the change of ownership in terms of the ability to monetize those?
Anne H. Lloyd: We've taken a look at that, as you would imagine, Adam, and believe that we'll be able to realize the value over the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Ward, can you please talk about your integration plan in a bit more detail? Once you do get the regulatory approval, especially on the aggregate side, just talk about the perspective of bringing aggregates folks to run the business of with -- at least on the aggregates footprint side.
C. Howard Nye: Obviously, we've got a very seasoned team in Texas, as does Mel. And what we're going to do is go through exactly what you would anticipate. We're going to have a best-athlete approach. We're going to make sure that we have the finest talent that's deployed in that business. We're going to take what we feel like is going to be a market-leadership position in the state of Texas and look to drive value from it. And the nice thing is when you [indiscernible] you'll see from both sides of this, we have a problem of riches from that perspective, and that's a nice place to be.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And any structural reason on why the price per ton on the Aggregates business on the TXI footprint would be meaningfully different from yours longer term?
C. Howard Nye: It's hard to see why it would be meaningfully different. We're picking up nearly 800 million tons of aggregates in Texas and Oklahoma in this transaction. So when you look at what it does to our reserve base, it's putting us nicely over 13 billion tons. And 13 billion tons of permitted reserves in the United States feels awfully good where I'm sitting.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Mel, can you give us an update on the pricing landscape in Texas and California cement markets? And just remind us how long are you contractually bound to existing cement prices? And what rate of cement price increases you're anticipating over the next couple of months?
Melvin G. Brekhus: Yes, we -- things haven't really changed since our last teleconference regarding that, Jerry. We have price increases that are occurring in Texas as we speak and more that will occur in April. We have price increases in California that are going into effect also in this first quarter of the calendar year. But more importantly, price increases that will occur in the April, May range. The business that we have under contract, as I explained in the last teleconference, is primarily the business that we have as a result of the tremendous amount of public works in -- ongoing in Texas. And I also would add that, that business, while it is under contract, the vast majority of that work does have escalators in it. And the other portion of the business that is under contract, if you will, is not longer than 12 months. And we also have the option to not ship that product if we choose not to. But we are choosing to ship it. But it's not going into our core market. So we aren't handcuffed by pricing. So long answer, Jerry, and sorry for it being so long, but pricing trends in Texas and California are positive.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Mel, the magnitude of price increases that you're expecting in the market in March and April?
Melvin G. Brekhus: It's about $8 in Texas. I think I'm pretty sure I'm right on this. About $8 in Texas and $5 in California.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And lastly, Mel, obviously you've added a lot of capacity, a really good point on the CapEx curve over the past couple of years. Any incremental opportunities to augment capacity? Or have you delivered on everything that's reasonable to execute?
Melvin G. Brekhus: Well, we've delivered on the major capacity additions and that -- the combined Martin Marietta and TXI assets will certainly benefit from that. There's always the potential for incremental tons in the cement business. We have, as someone pointed out earlier, really only one significant opportunity and that's to make some modifications at the Midlothian plant, to add some capacity. But as Ward and I have discussed, that capital would be spent if we can get the return on it, if the market calls for it. And only under those conditions would we be spending that capital. And it's not significant compared to the $400 million plus capital we spend when we build a greenfield cement plant. So most of the spending is behind us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So one of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about, Ward, and also Steve Zelnak, who I'm assuming is on the line, is kind of returns. And the focus of the company historically has had on shareholder returns measured more by EVA and kind of returns on invested capital, not kind of stock performance. And one of the arguments we've talked about in the context of downstream assets is greater cyclicality, greater capital intensity and greater volatility and, ultimately, lower returns. And I recognize that there's growth aspects to being in Texas and that TXI is a very unique asset. But just the first thing I wanted to ask you, in the vein of all those prior conversations, just what's really changed? I mean, again, we've always known Texas is the best state to have exposure to. But I guess when we run the numbers, this -- your invested capital is going to be $2.6 billion before kind of one-time costs that I'm guessing are going to approach $150 million, $200 million. And I'm guessing even at full benefit of pretax synergies and full benefit to the restructuring TXI's undergoing, that the return on invested capital's something approaching 6% or 6.5%. So can you just start by addressing how you think this affects your return profile as a corporation?
Anne H. Lloyd: Ted, as we indicated in the opening comments, we believe that our actual return on invested capital will actually grow at a faster trajectory as a result of the combination. The ability to deliver against the synergies, the ability to realize the net operating losses, the ability to generate value from excess real estate, all of those factors just compose -- be part of that return consideration. And also, as Mel just indicated, TXI has made significant investment in capital that, really, it's time to get out and let's let the market harvest that return.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: The deal will close in Q2, you expect. How soon thereafter might you try to do the debt refi?
Anne H. Lloyd: Our plan would be to do a debt refinancing at/or near the closing of the merger.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And Anne, little bit of a detail question here, but do you have any thoughts or guidance you can offer about where the tax rate might shake out? When -- with the combined entity? I mean, I know that's a tough question. But I mean, directionally, I would think it would be meaningfully lower than what you guys are reporting. Is that, at least, a fair way to look at it?
Anne H. Lloyd: That's probably a fair way to look at it. But in all candor, Jack, that's probably not appropriate for us to speculate on that right now. We'll continue to look at that and refine it as we move closer to a closing.
Operator: The next question comes on the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Congrats. I know this is lot of work. Can you just talk about the aggregates market in North Texas and what your pro forma market share there looks like?
C. Howard Nye: We'll certainly talk about the aggregates market in North Texas, and what we'll say is there's obviously a great deal of infrastructure work there. And as I indicated before, the population dynamics in North Texas continue to be some the most attractive in the United States. There's a Wall Street Journal article, I guess, last week, outlining the top 10 housing growth markets in the United States. I want to say that Houston was #1 on that list. I think DFW was #3 on that list. As you recall, Todd, DFW really lagged the rest of Texas in the recovery because you had simply more energy activity in South Texas, Houston and parts of San Antonio than you did at DFW. So from where we're sitting looking at DFW right now, we love the infrastructure work, we like what's going on in res, we like what's going on in nonres, and we think that's going to be incredibly attractive going forward. And coming back and looking at the market, it's a dynamic market. And we'll just leave it at that.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of SunTrust.
Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just one on the NOLs. Want to make sure I understand. You're expecting $400 million of NOLs within the next 24 months, getting the transaction price down, is that correct?
Anne H. Lloyd: After this, we think we'll be able to utilize over $400 million in NOLs on a pretax basis over the next few years.
Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as one questioner had before, usually there's some limitations on that in terms of how quickly you can realize those in mergers. Is there something unusual about these or something unusual about your position? And then second question is, part of the realizing those -- the assets that was said earlier which creates gains and then you can offset those?
Anne H. Lloyd: No, we've done an evaluation of the potential limitations as built into our understanding of the realization pattern that we believe we'll have on those net operating losses. And obviously, any time you generate taxable gains, you can also typically offset those with operating losses if you follow all the rules and regulations.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to return the call to Ward Nye for any additional or closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye: Laurie, thank you very much for turning it back to us. Couple of observations. One, we feel like this is an incredibly exciting time for Martin Marietta Materials and for Texas Industries. We think this combination is going to build considerable shareholder value in the near and long term . And I would ask you, please, to don't forget about what I think are some pretty special earnings for the Q4 this year. And I want to make sure that I give some real thanks to our team who helped make that possible. Thank you, all, very much for your time today. We look forward to speaking with a lot of you very soon, I'm sure. And we'll talk to you again when we're done with Q1 and this year. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's call and webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-11-07 14:00:00) =====
Executives: C. Howard Nye - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc. Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC L.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ward Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.
C. Howard Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As you saw in our press release, our third quarter 2013 results delivered double-digit growth in both net sales and earnings per diluted share. In a few moments, I'll provide the details for the quarter, our outlook for the balance of this year, as well as our preliminary thoughts regarding 2014. But first, as a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our earnings release related to our third quarter 2013 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available both on our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Now for our discussion. I'm pleased to report that our results represent a record in terms of sales for any third quarter. Our consolidated net sales of $600 million were up 12% over the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by volume and pricing improvements in the aggregate product line and a new third quarter net sales record for the Specialty Products business. The ability to leverage higher net sales, together with our company's inherent cost-containment culture, resulted in gross margin improvement and a net earnings per diluted share of $1.54, a 13% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our strong overall performance reflects gains in all of our product areas. Specifically, our Aggregates product line shipments increased 8.1% over the prior quarter, driven by strong private sector construction activity. Notably, 3 of our 4 end-use markets, which, together, comprise slightly more than half of our Aggregates volume, reported double-digit growth in shipments over the prior-year quarter. The nonresidential market led the way with a 19% increase, with growth in both the commercial construction and energy sectors. In fact, the strength of domestic shale gas production led to a 27% increase in shipments during the quarter. Estimated full year 2013 production at the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas is 1.4 million barrels. We expect this trend to continue as annual oil production at the Eagle Ford is expected to double in the next 5 years, reaching 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per year by 2025. The residential market continued to benefit from year-over-year improvement in housing starts and permits, experiencing a 15% increase in shipments, highlighting the resiliency of the ongoing housing market recovery in our key markets. Lastly, the ChemRock and Rail market experienced higher ballast shipments and reported a 13% increase in aggregates volume. We achieved solid third quarter results despite headwinds in public sector construction. Ironically, the public sector infrastructure end-use market, traditionally a strong market, is experiencing a temporary period of stagnation, and shipments to this market were relatively flat compared with prior-year quarter. This stagnation can be traced to governmental disputes, primarily at the federal level, where budget and deficit disagreements and sequester have led to uncertainty regarding future federal highway funding levels beyond the September 2014 expiration of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21. As a result, states and municipalities are reluctant to commit to large-scale infrastructure projects. While we still expect several of our key states, notably Texas, North Carolina and Florida, to benefit from the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, component of MAP-21, the pace of these awards has been slower than expected. To date, only 2 TIFIA awards have been made, likely further delayed by October's government shutdown. That said, we're cautiously optimistic that this stalemate in Washington is transitory in nature as most Americans want safe and efficient transportation infrastructure. Realistically, though, we're not counting on any meaningful impact from TIFIA before the second half of 2014 and, more notably, in 2015. As we look forward into 2014 and through the next construction cycle, we believe growth in private sector construction and increased TIFIA awards will lead to increased earnings. Additionally, when there's more clarity on federal funding, infrastructure spending should stimulate complementary public sector construction and, subsequently, our earnings potential. As noted, aside from federal level concerns, we are encouraged by actions taken at both state and municipal levels to advance investment in the growing infrastructure needs of their citizens. As an example, voters in 3 regions in the southern part of Georgia approved the 10-year special purpose local option sales tax to fund transportation improvements. This tax went into effect at the beginning of the year, and we anticipate the pace of the projects funded by this initiative to accelerate going into 2014. By further example, infrastructure activity in Indiana is a case study in innovative financing to meet state transportation needs. In 2005, former Indiana governor, Mitch Daniels, launched a 10-year transportation plan, known as Major Moves. Funded principally by the long-term lease of the Indiana Toll Road, Major Moves committed billions of dollars to infrastructure improvement. As Major Moves reaches its 2015 expiration, the Indiana Legislature continues to invest in infrastructure. In the recent 2013 legislative session, $215 million was targeted to new road funding from the dedication of a 1% sales tax, together with highway budget changes. Additionally, $400 million of general fund appropriations are being set aside for Major Moves 2020 trust fund to expand highway projects that enhance the movement of goods. Thus Indiana's vision and implementation of infrastructure investment as the pillar for economic growth provides a solid foundation in our Indianapolis market, as well as a model for others to emulate. We also expect a significant reconstruction effort along portions of the front range in Colorado in response to recent flooding. The cost to repair and rebuild roads, bridges and homes is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. At the moment, many of our employees and customers were impacted by this disaster, and we've been working where we can with our friends and colleagues, as well as local communities, municipalities and the state of Colorado to assist in this massive recovery effort. Our pricing momentum continued during the quarter, with each product line at the Aggregates business reporting increases. The Aggregates product line achieved pricing growth in each reportable segment, leading to an overall price increase of 2.3%. Pricing was strongest in the Mid-America Group, led by the Carolinas and Indiana markets. Our vertically integrated business has also achieved pricing growth, with the ready-mix concrete and hot mixed asphalt product lines reporting increases of 7% and 1.6%, respectively. Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance, delivering record third-quarter results with net sales of $55.8 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter. Sales growth reflects the increased sales of dolomitic lime provided by our new kiln capacity that became operational in the fourth quarter of 2012. On a consolidated basis, gross margin was 23.8%, a 70-basis point improvement over the prior-year quarter. We've leveraged net sales growth into a 140-basis point expansion of gross margin for the Aggregates business. All 3 reportable segments achieved margin growth, led by 200-basis point increases for the Southeast and West groups. Margin growth for the Mid-America Group was led by the Mid-Atlantic Division, where an 8% increase in Aggregates shipments, once again translated into incremental gross margins exceeding our publicly stated expectations. Gross margin improvement for the Aggregates business was tempered by a 2.6% increase in direct production cost per ton for the Aggregates product line. The primary drivers of the increase were 2 atypical expenses, 1 related to the Colorado flooding and the second to specific workers' compensation matters. We also saw increased repairs in certain districts. Gross margin for the Specialty Products business was 35.7%, affected by planned maintenance costs at the Woodville, Ohio operation and higher cost for coal when compared to the prior-year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $37.1 million for the quarter or 6.2% of net sales. The increase of $5 million over the prior-year quarter was partially attributable to higher pension expenses and a planned information systems upgrade that was completed in October. This investment in first grade information systems provides an important tool for our managers and has helped to allow us to differentiate ourselves from others in our industry. Consolidated earnings from operations were $100.8 million compared with $91.5 million in the prior-year quarter. In July, we completed the acquisition of 3 quarries in the Atlanta, Georgia market. The transaction added more than 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced our position in this key rebounding market. As we previously stated, our goal is to have a #1 or #2 position in markets with near and long-term attractive economic drivers. This transaction is wholly consistent with that strategic objective. For the first 9 months of the year, we generated operating cash flow of $165.6 million, an increase of over $40 million. In addition to the Georgia acquisition, we invested $102 million in capital projects while maintaining our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At September 30, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.06x, in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant. As we head toward 2013's conclusion, we're encouraged by positive trends in our business and markets, especially private sector employment and construction. For the full year 2013, we anticipate Aggregates volume to the nonresidential end-use market will increase in the mid-single digits, given that the Architecture Billing Index, a leading economic indicator for nonresidential construction activity, remains at a strong level. Residential construction is experiencing growth not seen since late 2005, with seasonally adjusted starts ahead of any period since 2008, driving our residential end-use market to the high-single digit volume growth. By contrast, the weather-related slowdown in Aggregates shipments experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with government austerity and the hesitancy created by the uncertainty of federal highway spending, leads us to expect Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to be down in the mid-single digits for the full year. Our ChemRock/Rail end-use market is expected to be flat for [ph] 2012. Cumulatively, dependent on fourth quarter weather, we anticipate Aggregates product line shipments will be flat to slightly up compared with 2012 levels. We also expect Aggregates product line pricing to increase 2% to 4%, although this increase will not be uniform across the company. Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to be slightly up compared with 2012. Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $335 million and $355 million of net sales and $18 million to $20 million of gross profit. Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment. SG&A expenses, excluding costs in 2013 and 2012 related to the information systems upgrade as a percentage of net sales, are expected to remain relatively flat. Interest expense should remain consistent with 2012. Our estimated income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $155 million. While still early, we started to frame our initial outlook for 2014. Based on McGraw-Hill Construction's recent economic forecast, together with our own market view, we expect shipments for all Aggregates end-use markets to increase compared with 2013. Infrastructure market shipments should increase slightly. We anticipate the nonresidential market will experience mid- to high-single digit volume growth, with continued strength in both the commercial component and the energy sector. We expect shipments to the residential market to have double-digit growth based on the trend in housing starts. Finally, we expect the ChemRock and Rail market to increase slightly. To conclude, we believe significant upside exists in our markets and Martin Marietta has demonstrated an ability to translate this improved macroeconomic environment into increased sales, earnings, earnings per share and cash flow. As noted, our future confidence is underscored by the growth of private sector construction activity that's spreading geographically. Nonresidential growth is predicted to accelerate, especially as more states and municipalities get support and votes from their constituents to make infrastructure improvements, thus providing what is typically a greater proportion of more aggregates-intensive projects. We're also cautiously confident that public sector activity will begin to grow and then expand as the overall economy recovers. Historically, infrastructure investment has been an area of political consensus. And while we've not factored any meaningful growth in federally funded infrastructure programs, all told, we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and thereby enhance long-term value for our shareholders. Thanks very much for you interest in Martin Marietta. The operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Ward, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned atypical costs. Could you expand a little bit on what they were and discuss the impact it may have had on your margin?
C. Howard Nye: Absolutely, Arnie. Really, it may fall in several key buckets. I guess, number one, we can look at some money that we spent typically bringing the acquired businesses that I spoke to in Atlanta really up to the type of level that we would expect. We spent a little bit over $3 million doing that in that market. If we take a look at what happened in Denver, you heard me reference the historic flooding that occurred there. We spent around $800,000 in repairs and other things in Colorado along the front range attributable to that single event, but I'll tell you perhaps even more notably is we think the profit impact for the quarter was probably $2 million down for us in Colorado, around $0.04 per share. So that's notable all by itself. And then lastly, and this one was odd for us, Arnie, we had about a $2.6 million debt on workers' compensation. As many of you have heard me say in the past, safety is the core function here in Martin Marietta and we've had 2 incidents earlier in the year that were serious that are atypical for us. And it's not the way that we do business, and it's not the way we like to go about doing the things that we do, because it affects people's lives. It also affects your bottom line and that had about a $2.6 million effect. If we go back to and really take those atypical items and then I try to outline, Arnie, what we would see is cost per ton would line up more with about 6.54 [ph] this quarter versus 6.56 [ph] in the prior quarter. So you can actually see, they had a rather profound effect on the cost to the quarter.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: And then my other question, if you will, on the asphalt tons to external customers, that was down 14% in the quarter. Is that more just driven by highway work or was there some other factor, weather or some other factor that may have caused that big a drop in asphalt tons?
C. Howard Nye: I think what you hit is the weather piece of it, Arnie. Remember, we picked up a much, much bigger piece of asphalt paving when we bought the assets in Colorado. If you go back to prior year, what you'll see is our asphalt tonnage was around 3.2 million tons, external was around 1.6 and internal around 1.5. So when we're watching asphalt tonnage go down, it's really the flooding that's in Colorado that hit that in the most profound way. So if I step back and simply measure it, what I can tell you is, on a year-to-date basis, 58% of our asphalt tonnage has been in Colorado. So when you've got that kind of a headline number in that market that has a 500-year event, it will certainly hit that percentage pretty hard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: First question is on pricing. Ward, you've offered a preliminary view for 2014 of volumes. Just wondering how you're beginning to think about the rate of pricing growth for next year?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, that's a fair question. Obviously, you've heard us say in the past how we feel like once we get some significant volume growth, pricing on a percentage basis, we believe, will start to follow that volume growth on a percentage basis as well. And I think that's very much what we've seen this year. What I like about what we've seen in this year, in particular, Garik, is we're looking at a very, very flat year. And the types of pricing that we thought we'd see, frankly with more volume, and I think we would've had it but for the Q2 weather effect has actually held up very nicely. And I think to underscore that, and I think this helps you build toward next year. You are looking at 2.6% pricing up in the quarter. But if you really go and take a look at the mix effect that we had, it really would have a great handle on it if it was more normalized, because what I will tell you is we saw some big jumps in the quarter in base and in sand and in screenings. And we actually saw some pretty notable drops in riprap. So in other words, we're selling more lower-priced products and less higher-priced products. Remember, too, that during the last call, I spoke to the fact that we had seen midyear price increases in around 11% of our markets versus really that 2% in the prior year. So when you take what I feel like has been the type of growth that we've seen this year and the mix effect that we've seen, I think when you come back and try to start modeling yourself on what that's going to look like next year, hopefully, that's giving you some direction. We'll obviously talk in much more detail about the pricing when we come out with the full year results in February. But I think that should give you at least an eye on it.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Just a follow-up on the mix effect. As you look out over the next, call it, 2 to 3 quarters, should we think that the mix effect that you saw in Q3 is going to continue, just given the timing and the size of the projects carrying a lower mix in backlog is going to persist?
C. Howard Nye: I think you might see some of that. But I think you might see some of that for good reasons, and here are the good reasons that I would go to, Garik, and that is, if I'm really looking at some of the major projects that we either have or that I think we're coming up. There is the moment [ph] . I'd really break it down into 2 different buckets, and I'll give you a drive across the geography, but I think this helps you get a mix piece of it. And right now, in Dallas, there's $5 billion of highway projects that we think will be there in 2014. That's up from $3 billion in 2013. To put things in perspective, the North Carolina's DOT budget is $3 billion. We're talking more than that just in DFW. I think when we go back to what we talked about in Colorado, I mean, the numbers that I'm saying coming out of Colorado are in excess of $400 million relative to just the work that has to be done to repair the flooding. That doesn't have anything to do with the RAMP program that's there as well. Even as we suddenly turn and come Eastern Mississippi and take a look at $1.2 billion of upgrades at the Orlando airport, or the I-4 project in Florida, all these will be starting, in many respects, with base and they're working their way up. Same issues with a $1.2 billion light-rail program in Charlotte, a lot of work at Douglas Airport. And then -- that's just in infrastructure. If we come across and look at what's going on in nonres, we're seeing considerable work in a number of geographies right now. What Boeing is doing in South Carolina is of major significance. Both MetLife and Citrix are coming here to the Triangle. What we've seen as far as data storage in Nebraska and Iowa has been absolutely amazing. I mean, big, big projects at Facebook, Google and Microsoft. And in Iowa, by itself, MidAmerican Energy's announced a $1.9 billion wind investment in that state. The reason that I go through that, Garik, because if you've got that degree of new projects starting, I think you can expect to see a higher degree of base going to a number of those. But the good news is, you're also going to see, during the fullness of those projects, clean products going through as well. So I think that's just important color for you to have as you think about the pricing trends and what the volume mix may be.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Just one final question on residential construction. Your volumes into the residential end market lagged the broader market in the third quarter. You're expecting double-digit growth into residential next year, which would imply that the gap between your shipments and broader housing starts would narrow. Is that a fair assumption? Should we think that the residential volumes for you in 2014 will look closer to what housing starts do next year?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, if you think back to it, I mean think of it in this terms. Residential housing segment for us at its low, let's call it 7-ish, 6%, 7%. Res for us at peak back in 2006 was around 21%. For the quarter, this quarter, res was around 13%. For the same quarter last year, res was around 8%. But here's what I think is happening, Garik, as we look at res. You've seen mostly a large explosion in multifamily residential over the last, let's call it, 18 months. You're seeing more and more single-family residential right now. You're seeing considerable lot absorption. And what's going to end up having, I believe, is you're going to see more and more single-family housing and you're going to see more subdivision development. Remember, part of what I discussed before, relative to housing is, we would end up being a laggard in housing this time because you have so many subdivisions that have the infrastructure built into them, that in the early phases of it, it would be about sticks and bricks. And what we have right now is western construction is not so much about sticks and bricks, but it's starting to be more about subdivisions. And now what we're starting to see, and I think certainly in the markets here in the East Coast anecdotally, you'd notice as well, it's becoming more mature and we are seeing subdivisions. So I would expect to see res go up, but what I would tell you, in normalized time, I wouldn't really expect residential to be much more than 14%, 15%, 16% of our volume anyway. So when we're getting in that 13% frame, that's not a bad place to be. But we will get the knock-on effect in nonres from it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: So if I look at your guidance for the rest of this year, it looks like you brought the resi volumes -- that residential volume set is down a little bit. Did something shake out of the quarter there?
C. Howard Nye: Yes, I think we just brought it on a smidge. I think part of what we're trying to sort out, too, Todd, is really what can we expect in some of the markets that has had better residential activity. I mean think about Colorado right now. I mean, that's one of the markets on res that's doing considerably better than others. And I think part of what we're trying to sort in our minds is how long can we expect that season really to last in that type of market. So we're just trying to measure that out very carefully right now.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: In Atlanta where you guys picked up the quarry, I mean how is that market developing? Is it starting to pick up?
C. Howard Nye: No, it is starting to pick up. And we actually saw some decent volume growth there. Kind of the biggest single issue in a market like Atlanta is it fell so far. I mean, we're operating in the teens as far as recovery on volumes in that market right now. So it's just a very volume-challenged market. But we are seeing North Georgia getting considerably better. What I can tell you for example from the Lafarge quarries that we picked up during the quarter, we sold almost 380,000 tons of material from those quarries just in Q3. And what you will have noted in the comments that I had is I did refer to Atlanta as a rebounding market and I do think that's where it is. Again, we're seeing good -- a lot absorption there and we're seeing much better volumes. It's got a long way to go. But the nice thing about the Southeast right now is a little bit of volume in that market is really very, very powerful. And you can see that a little bit of volume, actually, from a changing gross margin added 200 basis points to that market right now. So yes, it's getting better and we think it will continue to get better. We don't think it's going to get explosively better, but we think it's on the right trajectory right now, Todd.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. Switching to highway side. Your comments on TIFIA that only 2 projects have been approved from the, I guess the latest bill for '13 and '14, but you're looking for the volumes to pick up significantly in the back half of '14 and then even more in '15. What needs to happen between now and then for that outcome to occur?
C. Howard Nye: They need to start running projects, Todd. It's inconceivable in so many respects that we're sitting here today and 2 projects that've been led [ph] . And, by the way, they're both in Chicago. As we sit here and simply do our topside math, there are $46 billion worth of applications that are in right now, $46 billion. If we come back and take a look at the Martin Marietta markets, it's nearly $16 billion worth of work that we're going to have a very, very good and legitimate shot at right now. I guess my sense is we're probably going to see 2 or 3 more TIFIA projects, probably come out before the end of the year. But everything that we're hearing tends to indicate we're going to start seeing it come out in much more healthy chunks as we go into the New Year. But what has to happen, Todd, is they need to put some contracts out there and get it done. As I'm looking at the list that I have right now, I see there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 projects right now under review. And again, as we've said, only 2 of them had, had the credit agreements actually executed. And again, this is under the new TIFIA projects as you noted.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And final question, this is probably for Anne. Anne, looking at the SG&A in the Aggregates segment, I guess it's been running right at $28.4 million a quarter, really, all year. Is that a good run rate to think about?
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes, that's not an inappropriate run rate. Because most of the excess costs have been at the corporate level with whether it be our information systems project or other initiatives that we've been working on. So the aggregate SG&A should stay relatively constant.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Nothing seasonal in the fourth quarter there?
Anne H. Lloyd: There shouldn't be anything seasonal, not when it comes to that type of -- there are some per capita charges that go through there, but it's not materially consequential, Todd.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if we think about the $6 million-plus corporate line, is that coming in with the end of the IT project?
Anne H. Lloyd: That should come in as we move into 2014 with the end of the IT project as well as some other initiatives that we had going on this year.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: So maybe kind of continue at that run rate in the fourth quarter and then start coming in first quarter?
Anne H. Lloyd: That's not an unreasonable assumption.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research.
Christopher White: This is Chris calling in for Kathryn today. Just one question. I wanted to follow-up a bit on Colorado if I could. Can you tell us what type of overlap Martin has in those areas that are expecting a lot of the rebuild due to the flooding?
C. Howard Nye: If you think about putting all the flooding lies, I mean it was truly in Denver Metro and principally north of there. I mean, some of the worst flooding was in Boulder. If you're at our single largest quarry in that market, specification aggregates, you are looking right into Boulder. So what I would tell you is we're in a very good place to be able to supply those projects. The other thing that I like about it, Chris, is we've got good, hard rock in that market. A lot of what's being fed in that market, the farther north you go are from Louisville deposits. And some of the Louisville deposits I think were probably hit pretty hard with that flooding. So I think it's twofold. Number one, I think we'll have a nice place to be very helpful and supply materials going forward. And I do think in many respects, there's going to be some depletion plays that will benefit us from Boulder.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just had kind of a big picture question. If I think about people investing in Aggregates stocks the last few years, really the biggest question seems to have been, besides pricing power, just when the volume is coming back. And so we're seeing a little bit signs of that and there's reasons to be a little more optimistic. My question was, outside of simply volume recovering to the industry, what kind of opportunities are you looking at or do you see or should we focus on for you to continue to drive value in the underlying business? I'm just trying to understand just beyond cyclicality what the opportunity is.
C. Howard Nye: I think it's 2 different opportunities. I think the opportunity number one is where you position your business relative to markets. You've heard me say in my prepared comments that our long-term aim is to have a #1 or #2 position in markets that we think have near-term and long-term economic attractiveness. So if we pause and reflect on what that means for us, as we look at the swap that we did last year, Denver, Colorado for the River business, we think from our business, that was really a very constructive thing for us to do. We think that added considerable shareholder value. I think you can and should expect us to continue to look for swaps and to engage in asset exchanges on a tax free basis. It's a very efficient back of transaction to improve our market position. So I think that's one thing you can expect. I think as we turn our attention here to the corporate office, as part of what Anne was saying in response to an earlier question, is we had made some investments here in different functions. Part of what we're talking about regularly is functional excellence in this organization, in the corporate office, throughout our business as well. And we think that we can continue to get better, faster, cheaper at everything that we do. Part of what we're sensitive to, pricing, to your point, Adam, has been a great story. But we're still selling the product for less than $11 a ton. And at the end of the day, when that's the world that you operate in, you better be good on cost, because if you aren't, you're going to be out of business. So improving our markets, moving our business the way that we need to and being focused on functional excellence in addition to the volumes are the types of things that I think you should headline for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Just a few questions real quick. Ward, could you touch on the progress with midyear price increases that you had this year and how it compares to some of the traction you've gotten, say, like in last year, for example?
C. Howard Nye: Yes, absolutely. Trey, as you would recall, during the last teleconference, we spoke about the fact that we were seeing double-digit markets with midyear price increases on them. And we also said that as a practical matter, you're only going to capture a portion of that in the back half of the year because you're going to end up protecting customers on larger jobs on which you quoted them. So the midyear price increases that we discussed during the last conference call are in place, and they're going forward, as you would imagine. The primary thing that, that does, I believe, is it raises the bar on what your pricing can be going into the New Year. Obviously, we haven't given you any pricing guidance yet for '14, and we'll do that very, very early in '14. But the midyear price increases that we discussed were far more -- they're wider and more in dollars and cents than they were in the previous year, and we think that bodes well for next year in particular.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: How did that compare, Ward, to 2012? You said double-digit markets, what was that in '12?
C. Howard Nye: In '12, it's 2. If we go back and recall, we have gotten midyear price increases in San Antonio and we've gotten midyear prices in Houston, and that was really good. So you're talking double digits versus 2 markets last year. So it was a dramatic change year-over-year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Anne, on oil and gas, I mean, obviously big for you guys this quarter. What percent of your overall shipments go into what you would consider oil and gas?
C. Howard Nye: Here's the way you can think of it, Trey. Last year, we sold a little bit over 6 million tons to these different shale plays, and we think it will be slightly up versus where it was last year. What's fascinating though is to watch the way the movement works between these different plays. What I would tell you, Eagle Ford for us is clearly the single largest one, and we're looking at tonnage there that's relatively flat. Now, when we were having this conversation at the beginning of the year, we thought it would be relatively flat in Eagle Ford. I think people were dismissive of that. But now as we've come back and taken a look, part of what I really like to see is the plays like Marcellus, they've gotten much better this year. We're seeing about 0.5 million tons up year-over-year into the Marcellus. And then we also have a new entry into the [indiscernible] play, which is more in Oklahoma, and we think we're going to pick up nearly 200,000 tons there. So year-over-year, last year, slightly over 6 million. This year, a smidge more than that. But keep in mind, the thing that we haven't really seen yet, we're about to see it, is going to be the follow-on effect of DOT linings to come back and start to cure these roads, particularly farm-to-market roads in South Texas that have been destroyed by this heavy traffic. I've seen some bidding activity literally just this week on that. So that's been a very quiet issue that's been out there, but we know it's been building, and I think that's something that you're likely to see the knock-on effect out as we go into 2014.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Ward, I know you don't have a crystal ball but you're pretty well plugged in, what's your best guess or gut on kind of what we could see coming out of Washington as we approach the expiration of the current highway bill? Do you think that there's a chance we could get another short-term build put in place? Do think we'll be in a similar situation where we'll see a series of CRs or where do you -- what's your best guess on how that could shake out?
C. Howard Nye: Trey, you're right. I mean, that's a crystal ball that I wish had because I could do something else, not that don't love this. Trey, I guess I think of this. I think there's more consensus around at this time than there was last time. Let's start with that notion. At the same time, for me to sit here and suggest to you that I think there's going to be a single [indiscernible] from MAP-21 to the next highway bill, I just don't think it's genuine, because I don't think Washington can do that, frankly. Do I think they'll go through 9 CRs like they did last time? No, I don't think they'll go through 9 CRs. But I think Barbara Boxer is taking a very constructive role in the Senate to try to push this along right now. At the same time, we've got new leadership in the House and I think Congressman Shuster is taking a very, very productive approach on that. I think the bipartisan spirit that we're starting to see around highway funding is a very different conversation than we were seeing 2 years ago. So my sense would be, Trey, do I think we'll have a CR or 2? Yes, I think we probably will. Do I think we'll have 9? No, I don't. Do I think we might see more than a 2-year bill? Yes, I think we probably will. So again, if that's worth what you're paying for right now, Trey, I guess that's probably where I would be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: A couple of just housekeeping questions. You went through some of the transient items, $3 million in acquisition, $2.6 million on workers' comp, $800,000 on Denver. Can you just help us understand where those costs actually flowed through? Was the $3 million a P&L cost that flowed through Aggregates?
C. Howard Nye: It was the Aggregates line of product production costs.
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes. It's primarily a direct production cost. Almost all of it is costs, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And Denver would've been there, too, so you're looking like $3.8 million of add back?
Anne H. Lloyd: Correct.
C. Howard Nye: Yes.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And what about the workers' comp?
Anne H. Lloyd: Same thing.
C. Howard Nye: Same thing.
Anne H. Lloyd: All production costs.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And you called out some transient costs in Specialty Products. I think it was maintenance work on the kiln.
C. Howard Nye: Yes, that's exactly right. It's about $1 million, Ted. That's the quick way to think about that. We've taken a #4 kiln and #7 kiln and had some work also on #6 kiln all during the quarter and [indiscernible] spent about $1 million.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So when you add those back kind of incremental look like, what we would've expected and kind of what you've been putting up?
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes, and then you also look at coal. Coal is about $1.5 million. As we get that $2.5 million in the Specialty Products business, that's really completely reconciled prior third quarter to this third quarter.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So I guess, and I realize you're not giving the '14 guidance, but you're going to start getting decent volume absorption, knock on wood that we get this kind of like mid-single digit or better volume growth. Is there any reason to think we won't see the incrementals that you've historically talked about in Aggregates of being 50% to 60% in 2014?
C. Howard Nye: Ted, the biggest single driver that's going to be if we get the growth across the business. If we get it widespread across the business, I don't think there's any reason that you shouldn't expect to see that. Yet again, if the West continues to be disproportionately better than the East, it's more challenging, because the Eastern markets tend to be higher priced and more profitable. But if we really see these Eastern markets start to get some traction, and we are starting to see places like Charlotte get well and we're starting to see places like Atlanta get better, if we see that type of trajectory, I think what you're saying is right in the target zone.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, that's really helpful. And then on your 2014 framework, I recognized you cited a couple of different sources for perspective. Where would you have the -- I guess where would you see the best upside risk or biggest concern? And where's your confidence greatest among those kind of 4 end markets that 2014 is going to look better than '13?
C. Howard Nye: As we come back, I think the places that I have the most resilience around, we've got a good looking backlog at least as a projects that I'm looking at are nonres in potential -- I mean, in particular. So I think we'll continue to see nonres grow and I think we'll see that growth across the United States. And again, I tend to believe, Ted, that on the housing piece of it, where we are again, primarily a Southeast and Southwest company, the type of housing growth that we're going to see particularly as we start making that transition from less multifamily to more single-family, I think those 2 places add up a pretty good punch. And again, when you come back with nonres at 30% of the business and you come back at res, let's call it 13%, 14% of the business. Again, I liked what I saw in trajectory in ChemRock and Rail. I was seeing balance volumes going up with BN [ph] , with UP and with Kansas City Southern. And with the type of footprint we have there, suddenly, we're well over half of our volumes right there in those 3. And I have a -- and I feel pretty good about that, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And the last thing I'll ask, I promise. When we look forward to SG&A, I mean you mentioned about IT upgrades over in October. If you can help us understand what that kind of year-over-year benefit looks like next year? And then when we just think about headwinds and tailwinds, I'm guessing the pension expense should be down next year, we're kind of estimating $5 million to $10 million tailwind for you.
C. Howard Nye: Here's the way to think of it, Ted. I mean we've really been spending about $1 million a quarter on the information system. Really, if we come back and look at Q3, it's probably about $1.5 million, and we're bringing in for landing here so as we ramp that up. The pension expense, if you got a good sense of what discount rates will be at year end, that's going to be really your driver on what that's going to look like. And again, as we look at this year, we had $1.5 million for the quarter professional expenses tied back to that notion of functional excellence. And those are all costs that I wouldn't think would be repeating into next year. And the fact is, we anticipate getting benefit from those investments next year.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I recognize that none of us are, like you, have bought a crystal ball that I can forecast interest rates. I wouldn't be on this call with you. But would you expect that should be a tailwind sort of something dramatic happening in the next 7 weeks?
Anne H. Lloyd: Absolutely, you would. I mean, particularly at a minimum, the IF [ph] call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Ward, can you just talk about besides energy, which verticals, if you have the visibility, which verticals are driving the strength in your backlog for private nonres? And can you just talk about is it early-stage project work that you're seeing? Just so we can use what you're seeing us a way to read across through other industrial markets with nonres exposure.
C. Howard Nye: Jerry, I think that's exactly what it is. I do think it's early on, on that end and I think going back to that mix conversation that I was having early on the call, if part of what I think, when I'm seeing sand volumes up, let me give you a sense of it, Jerry. Sand volumes were up almost 630,000 tons in the quarter. That's a big number. What that tells me were a lot of [ph] ready mixed going out the door in some respects. And again, that's going to all be structural type of work, and I think it's disproportionate on that, if that's going to be into nonres projects right now. So when we're seeing let's start thinking about markets like Denver, start thinking about markets like Des Moines, start thinking about markets like Houston and San Antonio and even back in places like Dallas. And again, what we're seeing in markets today like Charlotte or even heading down into Charleston, South Carolina is a very, very different field as you and I would have been having at the same time a year ago. So I think your notion around commercial and product mix and ready mix in those markets, and either us supplying ready mix to some of them or the products to ready mixed players is a good way to think about it.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And your downstream business, can you just talk about at which point do you expect to see pricing power, especially in concrete ahead of material inflation? Do you think you might get to that next year, once the cement capacity for some of your suppliers and competitors becomes fully utilized? Is that the tipping point that you're looking for to get better gross margin expansion for your downstream businesses?
C. Howard Nye: The short answer is absolutely, Jerry. What's remarkable about the concrete business, if I look at the 2 principal geographies, which we're in the concrete business, here's a pretty big austerity in average for selling price between one and the other. And the ones that really has the higher selling price, we also have the ability to do more with pricing in the period. And I think you'll continue to see that market get much better. Remember in my prepared remarks, I talked about ready mix pricing being up 7.1%. And my sense has always been that's the single weakest link in the heavy building materials side, and when you're starting to see that type of pricing growth in ready mix, I think that's a very, very good sign for the balance of the industry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And in terms of the overall volumes, obviously, nice performance in the third quarter. I think your guidance implies more muted year-on-year performance in the fourth quarter. Is that just a function of comps or any moving pieces for us to think about in the fourth quarter? Any residual impacts from the government concerns or anything like that?
C. Howard Nye: You know what, it's really more looking at something that we just had to say may feel normal like in weather. What I remember last year in particular, our team in Colorado was doing some downstream work into December. And that's a great result and that's great for them and maybe they do that again this year, but my guess is, it's a rare year where you're paving in December in places like Colorado. I was there yesterday in the morning, it was 20-some degrees. So if it's a normal weather, I think that's at least how we're having to plan for it right now. And we're going to pray for better.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over back to Ward Nye for any further remarks.
C. Howard Nye: Listen, thank you again for joining our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in our company. We're dedicated to our disciplined approach to managing our business and increasing long-term value for our shareholders, and we look forward to talking with you about the fourth quarter and full year when we're together in February. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ward Nye, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
C. Howard Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials' quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're pleased to report second quarter 2013 results, which reflect growth in net sales and gross margin. As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our earnings release relating to our second quarter 2013 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. As today's press release outlined, our second quarter net sales increased 4%, driven by pricing growth in all Aggregates business product lines and reportable segments, as well as a new quarterly net sales record established by our Specialty Products business. The overall net sales increase is noteworthy considering the number of record rainfall levels in most of our key markets. To elaborate, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has tracked levels of precipitation for 119 years. Across this period, 2013 represented the wettest second quarter ever for Iowa. Rainfall was also excessive throughout Georgia, more than double the average levels in many markets, including Augusta, which reported its wettest month in weather history in June. Not surprisingly, weather-constrained shipments and production also affected our net earnings. Although it's difficult to isolate all of this quarter's weather impact, we know it was considerable in at least 3 specific areas. First, there were deferred product sales. Our estimate is that mostly heavy construction shipments were reduced by 1.5 million to 1.7 million tons alone, lowering net earnings up to $0.11 per diluted share. Second, throughput challenges created by extraordinary rainfall in predominantly open pit quarries significantly reduced operational efficiencies. Additionally, lower production volumes likely led to an underabsorption of fixed costs. The latter 2 items are more difficult to reasonably quantify than deferred sales. Therefore, we've not provided an estimate of their impact. Considering that backdrop, we were very pleased with net earnings that, on an apples-to-apples basis, were broadly similar to the comparable prior year quarter. As noted, while weather conditions hindered our short-term results, we continue to see positive indicators for increased long-term construction activity. On a year-to-date basis, private construction reported double-digit growth and further expansion is forecasted. Residential construction traditionally is the primary driver of many nonresidential and infrastructure projects. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate opportunities in our markets. During the quarter, pricing momentum continued for the Aggregates business as evidenced by pricing growth in each reportable group. The West Group led with a 2.8% increase over the prior year quarter. This was attributable to pricing increases implemented over the past year. In particular, pricing was most favorable in the Texas markets. The Mid-America and Southeast Groups reported average selling price increases in the second quarter of 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively. Of note, southeastern pricing was negatively impacted by reduced offshore shipments due to a production shortfall dictated by a ship loader repair issue that has now been resolved. On a year-to-date basis through June 30, our aggregates product line pricing rose more than 3%, leading us to reaffirm our full year pricing guidance of increasing 2% to 4%. And while the more significant benefit will be experienced in 2014, recently implemented midyear pricing increases reinforced pricing momentum. We also are especially pleased to report average selling price growth in our vertically integrated businesses, namely the ready mixed concrete and hot mixed asphalt product lines, reporting pricing growth of 8.3% and 4.3%, respectively, over the prior year quarter. We believe pricing improvement in downstream businesses, in addition to enhancing profitability, provides a strong indicator of the health of local construction markets and bodes well for future conditions. Consistent with the national trend in private sector construction, 3 of our 4 aggregates product line end-use markets reported shipment growth. Leading the way was the nonresidential market, which accounted for approximately 30% of quarterly shipments and increased 7% over the prior year quarter. Growth in the commercial component, namely office and retail, was partially offset by a decline in energy sector shipments, the result of a modest slowdown in shale oil field activity. The residential end-use market continues to satisfactory and sustainable recovery. Both housing starts and completions reported double-digit growth on a year-to-date basis over the comparable prior year period. For the full year, housing starts are expected to approximate 1 million, a level last seen in 2007. Encouragingly, third-party forecasts predict continued growth in housing starts. For the quarter, this end-use market accounted for 13% of aggregates product line shipments and had growth of 4% more than the prior year quarter. Lastly, our ChemRock and Rail end-use market accounted for 10% of quarterly shipments and grew 2% over the prior year quarter. Public sector construction has not kept up with private sector growth. While weather was a factor, delayed demand on large infrastructure projects and lower governmental spending contributed to an 8% decline in infrastructure shipments and overall reduction in aggregates product line shipments of 1.6%, both compared with the prior year quarter. We believe this slowdown represents a short-term step backward given the well-documented deficiencies in the nation's transportation system, increased state-level funding initiatives, as well as positive indicators of long-term growth. Consistent with the cycle we are experiencing in Texas, we anticipate increases in private sector construction in other geographic markets to stimulate growth in public sector construction to serve an expanding economy and population. We note early signs of this in Colorado and Georgia and are well positioned in both of those states for future growth. We are encouraged to see other key states, namely South Carolina and Indiana, increase funding for repair of existing roads and to construct new roads. South Carolina recently increased its budget by $500 million to fund repairs of existing roads, while Indiana approved up to an additional $415 million in annual funding for the construction of new roads and expansion of major highways. Additionally, the highway contract awards activity increased double digits in several states important to Martin Marietta, including Colorado and Georgia. Texas also reported strong award levels consistent with their stated expectation to let nearly $8 billion of projects in fiscal 2013. Texas has been proactive in applying for awards under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA. To date, the U.S. Department of Transportation has received applications for $42 billion of projects, inclusive of $7 billion in Texas, more than $1 billion in North Carolina and over $2.5 billion in Florida. While the DOT has not moved as expeditiously as many hoped, we still expect several awards to be made in 2013. Still, consistent with our previous viewpoint, we do not anticipate any meaningful impact from TIFIA projects before next year. We remain confident that TIFIA funding can ultimately support between $30 billion and $50 billion of incremental construction projects. Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance, establishing a new record as net sales of $56.6 million increased 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales growth for the dolomitic lime product line reflect shipments from the new kiln that became operational in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by a decline in domestic steel production compared with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 37.6%, a decline of 190 basis points, resulting from higher cost for natural gas and repairs. Overall, this business contributed $18.7 million of earnings from operations for the quarter. Despite weather interruptions, our operating teams' continued cost control focus contributed to a 20 basis point increase in consolidated gross margin. The Mid-America Group, led by the performance of the Mid-Atlantic Division, which includes Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, achieved a 150 basis point improvement in gross margin. Specifically, the Mid-Atlantic Division leveraged a 10% increase in aggregates product line shipments into an incremental gross margin that exceeded 100%. Direct production costs for the aggregates product line increased 4%, driven by the previously discussed weather impact, together with increases in costs for supplies, as well as maintenance and repair. For example, the Southeast Group's unplanned shipload repairs mentioned earlier negatively affected these quarterly costs and gross profit by $1.1 million. Consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.4%, up 20 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. On an absolute basis, these costs increased $2.6 million, largely due to expenses related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be completed later this year. Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $69.4 million compared with $59.2 million in the prior year quarter. Recall that 2012 quarterly earnings reflected $9 million or $0.12 per diluted share of business development expenses. For the first 6 months of the year, we generated operating cash flow of $48.5 million. We made prudent capital investments of $50 million while maintaining our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At June 30, our ratio consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.17x in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant. During the quarter, we established a new 1-year $150 million trade receivable securitization facility, which replaced the $100 million facility that expired by its own terms. The new facility can be increased by as much as $100 million, subject to our trade receivables balance. Borrowings bear interest at 1-month LIBOR plus 60 basis points, a reduction of 15 basis points compared to the prior agreement, as well as the arbitrage generated by the increased facility size. Earlier this month, we finalized the purchase of our previously announced acquisition of 3 aggregates facilities in the greater Atlanta area. This transaction expanded our geographic footprint and added over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves, thereby providing an enhanced valuable long-term position. The integration of these operations is now complete. We look forward to the contributions from our new quarries and employees. The inevitable question is this, what's the outlook? We're encouraged by various positive trends in our business end markets, especially in product pricing and in private sector activity. We anticipate volumes to the nonresidential end-use market will increase in the mid-single digits given the Architecture Billings Index, or ABI, which is the leading economic indicator for nonres construction activity, remains at a strong level. Residential construction is experiencing a level of growth not seen since late 2005, with seasonally adjusted starts ahead of any period since 2007. We believe this trend in housing starts will continue, and our residential end-use market will experience double-digit volume growth. By contrast, the weather-related slowdown in aggregate shipments experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with the delay in large infrastructure projects moving through the public letting cycle, lead us to expect aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to be down in the mid-single digits for the full year. Our ChemRock/Rail end-use market is expected to be flat with 2012. Cumulatively, we anticipate aggregates product line shipments will increase 1% to 3%. As previously indicated, we currently expect aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%, although this increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit. Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to be flat with 2012. Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment. SG&A expenses, excluding costs in 2013 and 2012 related to the information systems upgrade, as a percentage of net sales, are expected to slightly decline. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million. To conclude, we believe underlying demand for increased construction activity continues to exist. We anticipate the current growth in the private sector to lead to increased public sector construction. We are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and thereby enhance long-term value for our shareholders. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: First, a clarifying question. I know you mentioned the impact of weather directly on volume was $0.13 or so. I guess, my question is, can you -- I know you couldn't formally quantify, but can you give us a little better feel perhaps for the productivity hit that weather may have caused or some other way for us to gauge the weather impact in Q2?
C. Howard Nye: Sure, Arnie. Probably the best way for you to think about this is the way that I look at it, and that is I look at our tons produced per working man-hour a quarter -- of a quarter same quarter last year. We were down on tons produced per working man-hour about 3.6% over where we were in Q2 in '12. Our headcount hasn't changed materially at all. So when we come back and take a look at that number, what it tells me is when we have teams working in our quarries and it's wet and screens are being blanked out and you're having trouble moving product efficiently and crushing it, I think that's as good a direct correlation as I can give you. A 3.5% movement is pretty considerable. And the areas that got dumped with rain, as you can tell from the commentary and from the release, got an enormous amount of rain.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. And I know it's a business model, you never discuss midyear price increases until they're basically implemented. Now that we're past midyear, can you comment on the scope and breadth of midyear price increases that have been implemented?
C. Howard Nye: Sure. As you recall, last year, we announced midyear price increases really in only 2 distinct markets. We talked about them in Houston and we spoke to them in San Antonio. This year, what we're seeing is more geographic spread. For example, I won't go through the specific increases, but we've seen midyear price increases in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, portions of downstream business in San Antonio. We've seen certain midyear price increases in North Texas. We've seen them in Houston. We've seen them in South Texas. We've seen them in portions of our business in North Georgia. We've seen them offshore, and we've also seen them in South Georgia. So on a compare, Arnie, that's part of what led me to say in the telecon that we're seeing good pricing strength and momentum, and this is actually a much better story this year than it was last year.
Operator: Our next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: First, following up on pricing. For your fiscal '13 pricing guidance, it's unchanged for the year, but you are taking some pricing actions midyear. How much does the second half guidance take into account this -- the price increases? Or will the price increases really impact more 2014 pricing?
C. Howard Nye: Kathryn, I think the price increases will more impact 2014. I think if we look at it historically, what we would see is the midyear price increase might affect around 25% of your business for the remainder of the year. And really, it's simply setting a higher bar as you go into the following year. If you think back to the comments that I had, I commented that the pricing in Texas for the West Group really led the way, and the reason that, that was happening is what we saw last year in San Antonio and Houston. So if that trend follows into '14, as it did into '13, that's how I would think about that benefit.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: And how much do you think that volumes lost in Q2 can be captured in the back half of '13 and maybe give an early read on Q3 in terms of weather and volume dynamics?
C. Howard Nye: Well, I'd say -- well, I really -- I'll address Q3 when we come back and talk to you later in the fall. I'll talk a little bit about what we're thinking for the rest of the year, because if you take a look at the volume guidance that we're giving, really what we're saying with one to 3 in first range of, I want to say, 130 million to 132 million. So what thats saying is your implied volume in the second half of the year has to be, again call it, on the low end, 72 million; on the higher end, 74 million tons. Kathryn, I think a good way to think about this is go back and take a look at half 2 in 2010. 2010 was not necessarily a great volume year, it was a great year in our business, but go back and take a look at that. We had pretty good weather in Q4, that was important. But in 2010, in the second half, particularly in Q4, was one of the few times that we saw up volume across our entire enterprise and 2 things happened: the volume came through nicely, volume flowed; and we had, I want to say, around 70 million tons in half 2 in 2010. And we saw the types of incremental margins that we would like to see, again with volume up across the profile. The reason that I think of it that way, business to me feels better today than it did in 2010. And so when we look at what the second half volume guidance is, I think if you're looking half on half, that's not a bad way to at least go back and reflect on it.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: So you're saying volumes aren't lost, but the majority can be captured in the second half, that maybe some will trickle into 2014?
C. Howard Nye: Yes. I think that would certainly be the case. Think of it this way, Kathryn. Let's talk about our business in the Midwest in Iowa. Iowa, as we discussed in the first quarter, had a real winter this year as opposed to what they didn't have last you. They had the wettest June in history. You've got concerns about whether farmers can even plant some of their crops this year. So if we're looking at our business in Iowa, if you think of it as the bookshelf, you had a book in, shove it in pretty hard from the left. One of the real concerns I've got is what it's going to look like as we go into Q4. If we have a relatively mild dry winter and can run, I think a lot of what we've seen pushed off can be recovered. If we have a relatively early winter, I think it's going to be tough to recover that volume this year. That said, I mentioned that I thought most of the volume loss was on the heavy side, I think it's infrastructure work. And as you know, unlike commercial or other work, the infrastructure work doesn't tend to go away. So I don't view that as lost volume. The great question is going to be, can it be captured this year?
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: And how much does mix versus volumes impact gross margins in the West Group in the quarter?
C. Howard Nye: You didn't have significant mix issues in the West Group in the fourth quarter. I mean, we had some mix issues in parts of our business, but I wouldn't say it was a big deal in the West Group. Ironically, some of the mixed issues that we saw that's being more profound are some of the mix issues we actually saw in parts of the Carolinas that I view as indicative of an economy that is slowly recovering. And here's the way to think about that, Kathryn. Our base work in North Carolina was up 14%. Our sand sales were up 37%. And riprap, ironically, despite the rain, was down 12%, I've got to think that's still to come. But what's notable about that is as you go through the food chain on different products, as we discussed before, base is one of your lower priced products on a relative basis as is sand, and riprap tends to be a higher price. So if I look at the West, I don't see any real mix issue there at all that was necessarily favorable to us. And actually, I could cite some mix issues in some places that was not necessarily our friend on the raw pricing component.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: So volume was a greater impact on the West Group?
C. Howard Nye: No question. Absolutely, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question is from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: On the ship loader issue, did that have an impact on the average price that you can quantify at all?
C. Howard Nye: It did, Todd, because what happens, as you know, that's a long-haul process. You're coming out of Bahamas, you're typically coming into either a series of ports in Florida or you might be doing direct deliveries to the Caribbean. What I'll tell you is for the quarter, it probably reduced pricing in the Southeast by around 50 bps. And in June, all by itself for the Southeast, probably around 65 bps.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And do you feel like you gave up any volumes related to that? Or were you able to back and fill from other areas?
C. Howard Nye: Again, I don't think we necessarily gave up volumes on that, Todd. I think the question is going to be, do you recover some of those in the second half? If that's going to be a marine limestone product, it's going to be finding its way more infrastructural activities than others. So there's certainly more of a possibility in that, if it's apartment or other types of construction that you might have lost that volume. But I think part of what's most important to us now is that ship loader is back, running. It's in good shape, and we're operating the way that we want to operate.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: To restate that just a little bit, do you feel like any of the -- do you feel like you had a negative impact during the second quarter from having that ship loader down?
C. Howard Nye: Yes. I think we did, and then I don't think it was tremendous, Todd, but I think that we did. And I think the other thing that I would say is, if I'm looking at our volumes in Florida, they were up 8% for the quarter, and that's part of what leads me to believe that we probably did lose some volume there because that's an economy that, as we've seen, is slowly getting its legs back under it.
Anne H. Lloyd: And Todd, that impact was not only on the lost volume but obviously the cost as we indicated, too.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. Sure. On the volume guidance for the second half, I think you're sort of quantifying that 130 million, 132 million. Are you assuming for the back half of the year, specifically, if you change your expectations of that at all? Or is, basically, the decline in -- or the reduction in guidance due to the shortfall in the second quarter?
C. Howard Nye: Todd, I think the reduction is really to what's happened so far through half one. I mean, so if you take a look at what happened in the first quarter, as we said, it was a real winter. I think what just was extraordinary is really what happened in June. And one of our healthiest markets right now, if you think back to the conversations we've had, we said part of the differentiator we have this year are markets like Texas, Iowa and Colorado. So if we look at Iowa right now, Todd, I don't think any business has been lost there. My guess is if we spoke to our team out there, their biggest concern is, can we take care of the business that's left? And can we really get it all done this year? So I mean, that's how that feels to me. As I look at Colorado for the second half, remember, part of what we discussed is that new RAMP program in Colorado on maintenance. Remember, that didn't become law until we went into the new fiscal year, which is all 30 days old. So my sense always was that Denver and Colorado was going to be a back-loaded process this year. Although what we've seen in the first half feels better than it did last year. And then with respect to Texas, remember what we said about Texas, the single biggest concern we had around Texas was whether TxDOT really let all of the work that they said that they were going to let. And of course, they've come back now and taken their guidance down to about $7.7 billion worth of lettings this year. And what that's really effectively done is taking a big chunk of lettings, or at least the significant piece of it, and moved it into 2014. So hopefully, that type of data in the West, combined with what we just talked about in the previous part of your question with respect to Florida, gives you some help on that.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Absolutely. On the infrastructure, just one or 2 more. Thinking a little bit longer term, I guess, I mean, down 8% in the quarter was significant. You alluded in your comments to the idea that volumes were deferred mostly on the heavy infrastructure projects. And is -- are you suggesting that weather was more of an impact on that side than on the product side?
C. Howard Nye: I don't think that there's any question that it was more on that because you're moving more dirt and otherwise. Rain isn't necessarily going to stop some portions of home-building or commercial construction the way that it does heavy. And the other thing that I would tell you, Todd, is when you're looking at the percentages, remember, percentages can look huge on these types of numbers. I mean, here's the way to think about it. I mentioned to you that our volumes were up in Florida, 8%. I gave you that because we're talking about a single digit number down on infrastructure. 8% up in volumes in Florida means 60,000 tons. We actually saw volumes up 13% in the eastern half of North Carolina. In other words, the part of the state can -- they can actually take heavy rains but percolate through and 13% up in Eastern North Carolina means a whopping 250,000 tons. So these percentages, based on today's numbers, are tough to really sort your way through until you go back and look at what the base numbers are. It reminds me a lot of the way that we look at housing. I mean, housing on a percentage basis can be way up, and you're still seeing a number that is considerably below a 50-year average.
Operator: Our next question is from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Maybe the starting point and you're often kind enough to give us kind of an EBITDA bridge. Is there any chance you could just kind of start there to help us understand the key puts and takes in the quarter?
Anne H. Lloyd: Sure. Give me one second. Yes, if you look -- no, that's the [indiscernible] numbers, he wants the quarter number. If you look at the quarter, pricing generated about $6.3 million of gross profit. Volume took away about $6 million. Cost improved $1.6 million. And then, both our vertically integrated operations and Specialty Products contributed about $1.4 million each to gross profit for the quarter.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So okay. That's helpful. And then in the cost side, I was just wondering if you could through some of the more granular level. I know Ward mentioned that tons produced per working man-hour was down 3%, but could you maybe just help us understand kind of the key buckets within the cost side and any impact they had?
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes. The key buckets on the cost side, obviously, we indicated that repairs were high in the Southeast. That was directly related to the ship. That ship loader was about $1.1 million of production cost increase there. Our fuel was up. Nat gas was up about 47% in the Specialty Products business, had a little bit of an increase in fuel cost in the Aggregates business.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So I guess, the thing I'm trying to figure out is the comments you've made on flat direct costs. And the way we've kind of thought about your direct costs is just look at the pure aggregate sales and gross profits to more directly relative to external tons. And in the first half, if I've got my math right, it's up the better part of 5% and I know you've talked about it being flat. So I'm just wondering, a, does that imply that in the back half, it's down? And is that just better fixed cost absorption, something of that sort? Or is there a different from the math that we would look at based on your disclosed financials versus the way you talk about the business?
Anne H. Lloyd: I would say that you're exactly right. Our view is that with the volume in the second half of the year, you have better absorption and better cost profile period because your productivity measures should be higher.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So then it's -- okay. So that ties out to kind of the way you're tracking. You're actually up 5% year-to-date and it just improves to go flat next year?
Anne H. Lloyd: Correct.
C. Howard Nye: Exactly, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And so how would you encourage us to think about that kind of next year or more on a normalized basis?
Anne H. Lloyd: Well, we usually provide you with what we think cost per ton is going to be doing from an annual basis when we give you guidance. I will update that and provide you insight into 2014. Obviously, it will depend on the volume, and you can make your assessments of volume for what you expect by the end use in 2014. And I would tell you that at our guidance now between 130 million to 132 million tons, you still are in a normalized cost profile. You're probably still running 70-30 fixed variable. And as you continue to move up that curve, you'll work your way back to kind of 60-40 variable fixed. So you can decide again what you think volume trajectory is going to be and apply some rational move of that cost profile.
C. Howard Nye: Ted, the other thing I would encourage to keep in mind is the biggest single driver on costs is going to what we do or don't do with personnel. And I can tell you, we are going to be very, very slow to hire as any recovery comes back. So you can watch that headcount line and what's going to happen with personnel, not be driven by host of new people coming into the business. Probably in that cost bucket, the ones that are going to be more variable at times is just what you would expect, it's going to be around energy. Remember, that's going to be around 12% of our cost of goods sold. Here's something for you to think about, though, even as we think about energy, and I know we've had some discussions before around Specialty Products group. Even as we look at what was a fairly dramatic spike with respect to energy for nat gas in that group, it was up, I want to say, 47% for the quarter, that translates to around $250,000. So what I think, I think there are a number of things that our operating teams do well. I think they do cost control really well. And I think as long as we maintain that headcount number in the right place and we continue to put capital in the right places, I think you'll like the cost story going forward.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Then the last thing I just wanted to ask and I'm going provide you with the opportunity to embarrass me here, but I guess the way I've always thought about this business is, the aggregates specifically, is every day we're pushing to get pricing, every deal is negotiated one-off, but there isn't such a thing or has never been such a thing or typically such a thing as midyear pricing increases because every day we're fighting for pricing. So am I off base with that kind of perspective? And I was wondering if you can just frame out, I know you highlighted some areas in which you got this midyear price increase, but could you walk through how many MSAs you actually imposed at a formal midyear end price increase versus just fighting for price every day?
C. Howard Nye: No, I guess, Ted, I would encourage you to think about it a little bit differently. I think the way that you're thinking about pricing is what it might have been around 10 years ago because I think it was more refined every day. I think it was more of a volume-driven marketplace than it is today. And I think if you go back and start looking realistically around 2004 or '05, the notion of midyear price increases started to come into the vernacular and customers started expecting that. I'll tell you, what drove it was some cement shortages and volatility in energy at that time because people are having a hard time keeping up with it. The notion of bidding a project over a 3- or a 4-year period without escalators also is something that went away. And so what I would tell you from the way that we approach our business, we want to make sure on that day-in and day-out business that you're referring to on a long-term project, we've got good escalators built into the agreement. Now what we're doing separate and distinct from that in these marketplaces that we're talking about across the U.S. today, we are coming back and putting in certain midyear price increases. As I look at it, to try to answer your question specifically, I see some degree of increases in Eastern North Carolina; South Carolina; parts of San Antonio downstream, that's 3; North Texas, some uncertain products, that's 4; Houston, again on certain products, that's 5; South Texas, on certain products, that's 6; North Georgia, on certain products, that's 7; we've seen some specific customers offshore, that's 8; some in South Georgia, that's 9; and some in West Virginia as well. So juxtaposing it to last year, to last year, around 10 this year. So that's the type of movement that we're seeing, Ted.
Anne H. Lloyd: And Ted, the other thing I would encourage you to do is if you -- as Ward indicated earlier, when we do a major price increase, it usually affects about 25% of our business. So when we mix -- that means that we've made a commitment on pricing, on that 75% of the business that really can't be adjusted or won't be adjusted until we come around for this time or to next year. So if you think about the contractual backlog that may be there from a sense of we're going to give a customer a requirement price for the year and so that price will be honored for the year.
Operator: Our next question is from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Just first question is on the shale business. You said that you're seeing some modest slowdown there and it's been a source of strength in previous quarters. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what happened in the quarter, where and perhaps what the outlook is?
C. Howard Nye: I'd be happy to, Garik. If you think back to what our volume to shale looked like last year, it was a little bit more than 6 million tons. The way we're seeing it this year, it's probably going to be closer to 5.5 million, maybe a little bit off of that. Quarter-to-quarter, the variance, about 132,000 tons, so it's not an enormous variance. Here's the noise that I'm seeing on it. We continue to see, as we discussed last year, drops in Barnett and Haynesville, and in large part because that doesn't have the dual play of gas, as well as the oil. We've seen a moderate slowdown in Eagle Ford. But here's the flip side to it, we're seeing a pickup basically in the Mississippian and in the Marcellus as well. So what I would say is from a rig count perspective, Texas is down, like a little bit north of 6%. But if we're looking at Colorado, Ohio and West Virginia, all really very positive. I mean, percentage change in Colorado, again, Niobrara play, 4.6%. Ohio, I mean, in large part's driven by what's going to happen with Utica, up 88%. And if we look at West Virginia, again, the Marcellus play, up around 8.3%. So it's uneven. But as a whole, it is moderately down. I hope that helps, Garik.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: No, it does. And I guess, just switching to infrastructure. If I remember correctly coming out of the first quarter, you were looking for a mid-single-digit infrastructure growth. Now you lowered your expectations for this year to mid-single-digit declines. I can appreciate weather is playing a big role there. But just given the puts and takes of your various geographies and Texas putting up -- pushing out their letting schedule, however, Georgia is seeing an increase, it seems like a fairly sizable reduction in the infrastructure outlook, at least just optically. Is there anything going on that should have us concerned that the infrastructure outlook is actually deteriorating throughout the second quarter?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, I don't see it deteriorating. I'd see it staying in a lot of places relatively flat. I think North Carolina is a good example of that. I mean, we're seeing some recovery in private construction in this case, but a relatively flat DOT. I think what we're seeing with Texas, simply pushing some of their work to the right is something that we're mindful of. I think the issue that we've outlined in Iowa with respect to weather and whether we can really make that up over the balance of the year is a very fair question. And I think we will have to sit back and watch what's going to happen with the RAMP program in Colorado. It's going to work, it's going to do exactly what they said. I'm anxious to see how quickly it comes into the process. So I think more than anything, what we're sensitive to is really June was a washout in significant portions of our business, and that's in the middle of the season when you're expecting to be producing with high efficiency, selling with great efficiency and making sure that we can make that up in states like Indiana and Ohio and Nebraska and Iowa and Minnesota, all of which can be seasonally hit pretty hard at some point in Q4 is part of what gives us some caution around that.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And just lastly, on the Lafarge acquisition, the assets down in Georgia, can you provide us some benchmarks with respect to volumes that the quarries are producing, EBITDA that you've been able to pick up? If you could disclose the purchase price, that will be helpful. And then also, is any of the volume that you're picking up embedded in your 1% to 3% volume guidance for the full year?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, that's the market that, on a percentage basis, probably fell more than any other single market. We haven't given anything on the purchase price, and for agreement, we're not going to do that. What I can tell you is we didn't have to follow Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for that transaction, so that's going to give you a sense of the scope of it. And back to my point, we picked up over 0.75 billion tons of reserves in a market that we feel like it's going to be a very attractive long-term market. Now in total fairness, Garik, as we look at that deal, if people want to take the bare view that the southeastern United States has seen its greatest day and that population trends aren't going to continue to come there, and Atlanta, Georgia isn't going to be a driver of the southeastern economy, then I think coming back and saying that you really want to buy a #2 market position in Atlanta is a perfectly fair question. On the other hand, if we come back and say, that did give us the #2 position in Atlanta, we believe, based on population dynamics, it's going to be very powerful. Then picking up 800 million tons in that market feels awfully good. We haven't given any EBITDA numbers per se on that business. Obviously, that's a part of the United States that, right now, needs one thing predominantly and that one thing is volume.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And is the volume that you're picking up in the guidance for the full year?
C. Howard Nye: Yes. It's baked in there, Garik.
Operator: Our next question is from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: On residential, Ward, you still seem pretty positive there. And I was just wondering, you guys have stated many times that, over the years, that aggregates are really used more in subdivision work. You really need new development activity in housing to generate a lot of aggregate use. Are you seeing more of that now? I mean, is that kind of what underlies some of this ongoing confidence in residential in terms of what customers are telling you and what you see them planning?
C. Howard Nye: Jack, it is, and it's not even what we're seeing. And in fairness, I mean, it's spotty and it's different in the West is better. Candidly, part of what I liked about Q2 volumes is I'm looking at the spread of business: 47% infrastructure, 30% nonres, 13% res and 10% ChemRock/Rail. That's starting to feel like a more normal spread, at least on a percentage basis, as this business really starts to grow. Part of what I continue to be moved by with respect to housing is while the June data was below expectations, and I think in fairness caused some concern, the 12-month rolling story, we think, still tells a good tale of what's going on. Building permits were 16.1% above the June 2012 estimate of 785,000. Housing starts were 10% above at a rate of 757,000. And housing completions were 20% above June 2012 at a rate of 628,000. So part of what we're looking at is completions need to increase by over 30% just to catch up with starts. And I think that ties back into the initial comments that we made. We feel good about what we're seeing in private construction. We're feeling increasingly good about what we believe that's doing to office and retail as well. I mean, if we're taking a look at what's happening with office and retail, again, I'd say this, Jack, because I think housing is driving some of this, a place like Charlotte is showing nice vacancy moves from over 20% to around 15% right now on office vacancy. And we're seeing the same types of numbers in industrial. For example, Orlando went from almost 20% vacancy rates down to 16%. So we think housing is driving a good bit of that. But as we come back and really look at it in our markets, to try to be more specific with you, we feel awfully good about what we're seeing in Colorado. Units are up there 68%. And get this, in North Carolina and Georgia, and we think this is incredibly important, they're up 32% in both of those states. And Texas, which has been healthy, obviously, for a while, units are still up 17%. So we feel like that on both the single and multifamily piece of it is helpful towards driving us to that 13% end number higher. We also think it's going to put more constitution in that 30% that's pure nonres.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. That's great. On SG&A, the press release mentions excluding cost in '13 and '12 related to information systems upgrade. SG&A will be down slightly as a percentage of sales. But on a reported basis, will the SG&A in the back half of the year kind of look like it did in the first half?
C. Howard Nye: Yes. I think it broadly will, Jack. I mean...
Anne H. Lloyd: We'll be through with the upgrade in the fourth quarter, so those costs will kind of roll through the rest of the year.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And so again, on a reported basis, next year we might see, I know you're not giving guidance for next year yet, but we might see a decline in SG&A dollars, all else equal, for that reason, right?
C. Howard Nye: Let's just say, if we're doing an upgrade next year, something went wrong.
Operator: Our next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Ward, can you talk about the outlook in each of the 3 reportable segments in the back half of the year? Which ones do you expect to put up better volume growth? Which ones is going to be tougher given the difference in pricing points that certainly has margin implications based on how much visibility you have between the different regions?
C. Howard Nye: Yes. We're talking different regions of the country, not different end users, is that what you're asking, Jerry? I just want to make sure I've got your question.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. So yes, exactly, Mideast, Southeast, West.
C. Howard Nye: Okay. I guess, from where I sit, the West Group continues to have the most upside right now. Again, I think Texas, the infrastructure work and housing and rising commercial in Texas, we think, has a good future ahead of it and we think will continue to be strong. I think the infrastructure work and the nonres work in Iowa will continue to be strong. We love Iowa. There are not a lot of people moving there, so I'm not saying the residential number is going through the roof, but I do think that's going to be good, steady business. And a lot of that's driven by the farm economy. The fact is that economy is just never gone down during this downturn. I think the story in Colorado continues to be a very powerful story. I think the infrastructure piece of that will be healthy. We're seeing a lot of bidding activity in that state right now, particularly in the metro and north of Denver. We continue to believe the residential story is going to be good, and the commercial story there is pretty good. We're pretty bullish on Colorado right now. We knew, coming across the Mississippi, that this was going to be a tougher year for a place like Indiana. The Major Moves is waning, but you're also seeing Indiana come back and put over $400 million into infrastructure in that state. So that business is right where we thought. In a state like Ohio, part of what I like I'm seeing there is sand sales are going up, which means ready mixed is getting better, which means single-family housing, multifamily housing and commercial is getting better in that market as well. As we come down and take a look at Virginia, and the fact is Virginia is sitting in a pretty attractive place, this isn't so much a rest of the year story, it's beyond that because they've come back. They've put in a new infrastructure funding program there. And we're going to see, over a 6-year period, billions of dollars more invested in Virginia than we've seen. If we look at North Carolina, Jerry, I think part of what's important is we do have a new Governor. We've got a Republican Legislature House and Senate. We haven't had this in North Carolina in 150 years. They're very dedicated to giving their fiscal house in order, which I think they're doing. Part of the transportation planning in North Carolina is putting more money into the urban areas. Now there's a bit of debate in some parts of the economy around that, which I get, but if you're Martin Marietta and you have a significant presence in the eastern part of the state, near New Bern and Wilmington, as well as Raleigh-Durham Chapel Hill and in Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem and Charlotte, that's not a bad place for us to be. As we look at what's going on in Southeast, again, that's the one that has gone down with the hardest thud over the last 4 or 5 years. But again, I'd take great heart in the fact that we're seeing the type of volume uptick in Florida that we're seeing. And again, we're starting to see housing come back in Georgia, and we're starting to see good employment numbers as well. So as we come back and think about what parts of the country we can feel largely better about, the job recovery that we're seeing now in Southeastern United States, as we discussed in the Q1 call, is starting to outpace the national average, and it hasn't been there for a while. I mean, here's something to think about. At the current pace, we're less than a year away to regaining peak employment. I mean, that's a great number for us to have in our minds because people with the job will either go and move into an apartment, build a home or otherwise. And God knows all those kids who are living with mom and dad want desperately to get out of there, their parents do as well. So we think the job situation is incredibly helpful for that. But if we come back and look at state employment change, again, to give you a sense of how we're looking at it, Texas and Colorado both lead in job growth and we're looking at a U.S. growth percentage of 1.5%. Texas is at 2.7%, Colorado is at 2.4%, and here you go, Georgia is at 2.2%, South Carolina at 1.7% and North Carolina at 1.7% and Florida, as well, ahead of the national average. So Jerry, that's -- I'm probably not answering your question, how does it feel in half 2, but to tell you the truth, what I'm looking at and I think what a lot of people were looking at are the long-term fundamentals that we're talking about as the industry continues to recover and where and why. And I think those are your drivers.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the downstream part of the business, you've spoken about a couple of areas where you're putting through additional price increases. I'm wondering if, based on the cadence of those price increase, you expect year-over-year pricing for asphalt and concrete to accelerate for your business in the back half of the year. I guess, how meaningful are those increases?
C. Howard Nye: I think in some places, in Texas, you'll see that. I'm not seeing a lot of that really in Colorado for the balance of the year, although we are already talking to customers in Colorado now about what we believe our price increases will be going into next year. And again, if we're taking a look on the ready mixed side in particular, our volumes in the quarter in ready mixed in Colorado were up 28%. If we look for the -- for half 1, they were up 30% there. So again, that's a very healthy market right now, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And what's your sense on the magnitude of downstream price increases that, in areas where you're not vertically integrated, your customers are seeing? Is it similar level of price -- pricing power that you're showing here with your concrete and asphalt business? Or how much variability is there in other regions where you're not integrated?
C. Howard Nye: I think there continues to be an emphasis, at least in our business, of coming back and revisiting where concrete stone pricing has been because that has been a sector that was hit pretty hard. And I think it's a practical matter. They were not seeing, at least from us, the types of price increases perhaps other sectors were. And I think there's some recovery there on that piece of it, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question is from Rohit Bhatia of Exane.
Rohit Bhatia - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division: My question has been answered.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.

Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and guidance. As anticipated, first quarter aggregates product line shipments declined 8.8%, indicative of a more typical winter in most of our geographic areas and, in a host of instances, colder and wetter conditions than usual. Accordingly, in the majority of our markets, we're seeing a later full start to the annual construction season compared with last year, when we benefited from an unseasonably mild winter that accelerated the start of construction on many projects. To anecdotally illustrate the impact of weather, I'll cite our Des Moines, Iowa district. The average temperature in Des Moines for March this year was around freezing. In March 2012, with the exception of one day, Des Moines temperature never dropped below 50 degrees. Among other reasons, that's relevant because, as a general rule, the placement of hot mixed asphalt paving requires ambient air temperatures to be above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Not surprisingly, March shipments in this particular district were down 29% in 2013 compared with the prior year. On a company-wide basis, the quarterly decline in aggregates product line shipments directly correlated to a reduction in our consolidated gross profit. All that said, we are especially pleased with our first quarter pricing performance. Not only did our aggregates product line increased 5.7% over the prior year quarter, but we also achieved pricing growth in all -- in our vertically integrated operations. Our hot mixed asphalt product line pricing increased 5.6% and our ready mixed concrete pricing increased 8.8% or $6.64 per cubic yard. We believe the overall pricing performance compared with the prior year quarter is indicative of improving market conditions and the successful application of our disciplined approach to pricing. Our quarterly results also reflect exceptional performance in the Specialty Products business, which established new records for net sales and gross profit for that business segment. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by many positive indicators of construction activity, including increases in housing starts, construction employment and highway obligations. The benefits of these improvements should be experienced during the remainder of the year. Accordingly, given solid pricing and volume fundamentals, we reaffirm our full year guidance initially provided in February. Our first quarter aggregates product line pricing trend bodes well for our performance for the remainder of the year. The improvement was widespread, as evidenced by increases in nearly all of our markets. Growth was led by the West Group, where price increases implemented over the past year, along with the favorable impact of product and geographic mix, resulted in an 8.7% increase. Notably, this growth was led by the performance in our Texas markets. The Southeast Group reported a 5.8% increase, while the Mid-America Group had a 4.1% improvement. As previously discussed, harsh winter weather hampered quarterly aggregates product line shipments, leading to volume declines in each of our reportable groups and 3 of our 4 end-use markets. The exception was the residential market, which, despite poor weather conditions, had a 1% increase in quarterly shipments over the prior year. The improving housing market, which is an important trend for both the overall economy and the aggregates industry, specifically, is leading the current economic recovery. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts in March was up 47% over the March 2012 rate. The increase in residential shipments represented the seventh consecutive quarter of improvement in this end-use. The infrastructure end-use comprised 42% of our aggregates product line shipments for the quarter. We continue to see positive indicators of growth in this market for the remainder of the year. Through March, highway obligations for the current fiscal year are at their highest level since fiscal year 2010, and they're up 28% over the prior year period. Further, highway contract awards for the trailing 12 months through February represented the first period of growth in almost 2 years. This trend continued in March with national highway obligations up 4% over the prior 12-month period. These trends reflect funding stability provided by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21. Additionally, at the state level, strong transportation programs in both Texas and Colorado should continue to provide positive volume momentum. Texas anticipates letting $9 billion of projects in fiscal year 2013, listing more than twice the amount let in the prior fiscal year. Also, Colorado's Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnership or RAMP program should infuse an additional $300 million per annum of construction in that marketplace over the next 5 years, effectively increasing Colorado's traditional highway budget by approximately 50%. We continue to see an increase in applications for funding assistance provided by the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA. 17 states, including Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, have submitted proposed projects totaling more than $41 billion. However, the process to award TIFIA funds has been protracted as the U.S. Department of Transportation has opted to allow time for all applications to be submitted before selecting recipients. This isn't surprising given the TIFIA projects, by law, must be of a regional or national significance. Thus, we continue to believe the more profound impact of TIFIA will be experienced starting in 2014 and remain confident that the TIFIA funding provided in MAP-21 can support between $30 billion and $50 billion of incremental construction projects. We also believe the TIFIA program will likely be funded at similar or enhanced levels in future highway builds. The nonresidential market continues to represent our second largest end-use, comprising 33% of our quarterly aggregates product line shipments. Volumes to this market were again driven by strong energy sector shipments. We continue to be encouraged by the Architecture Billings Index, or ABI, which measures billings for architectural services by construction type. The ABI has shown strength for 7 straight months. In February, it rose to its highest level since 2007. The ABI is the key indicator and typically leads nonresidential construction activity by 9 to 12 months. To complete the discussion of end-uses, the ChemRock/Rail market declined 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to weather and decreased coal traffic in the Western United States. Our Specialty Products business generated $55.2 million of net sales, a new quarterly record. The 6.7% increase in net sales over the prior year quarter is attributable to the new dolomitic lime kiln at our Woodville, Ohio facility, which became operational during the fourth quarter of 2012. This growth was partially offset by the absence of a higher-margin sales to a customer that is currently in bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the sales increase led to a first quarter record gross profit of $19.6 million. Our consolidated gross margin, excluding freight and delivery revenues for the quarter was 3.6% compared with 6.8% in the prior year quarter. The decline resulted directly from the reduction in aggregate shipments. The reduced operating leverage led to a very slight increase in our aggregates product line production cost per ton. Consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.9%, up 150 basis points. On an absolute basis, these costs increased $4.6 million, primarily due to expenses related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be completed later this year, as well as the nonrecurring software licensing cost, which provides a scalable platform for growth. Consistent with our stated objective and history of possessing a lean and efficient management structure, effective January 1, we reorganized the groups within our Aggregates business. Our Southeast Group remains unchanged. Our newly created Mid-America Group includes operations in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, which were previously reported in the former Mideast Group. The Mid-America Group also includes operations in Iowa, Minnesota, Eastern Nebraska, North Dakota and Washington, all of which were previously reported in the West Group. There were no other changes to the West Group. All prior period disclosures have been reclassified to reflect this change, and there is reclassified historical information on our website. Our consolidated loss from operations for the quarter was $23.6 million compared with $35.3 million in the prior year quarter. Recall that 2012 quarterly earnings reflected $26 million or $0.34 per diluted share of business development expenses. Our loss per diluted share for the quarter was $0.61 in 2013 compared with the loss of $0.81 in 2012. The reduction in shipment volume directly contributed to the EPS decline when compared with the 2012 results, adjusted for business development expenses. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $19 million. We made prudent capital investments of $22 million and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At March 31, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.22x, compliant with the limits under our debt covenant. Earlier this month, we established a new 1-year $150 million trade receivable securitization facility, which replaced a $100 million facility that expired by its own terms. The new facility can be increased by as much as $100 million, subject to our trade receivables balance. Borrowings bear interest at 1 month LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Consistent with our articulated strategic objective of possessing leadership positions in high-growth markets, in the first quarter, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lafarge North America to acquire 3 aggregate facilities in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. This transaction, which will close later this year, will add over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves in the Atlanta metropolitan area, thereby providing us an enhanced, valuable, long-term position. Once closed, we look forward to working with the teams of these North Georgia facilities as we integrate the operations into our existing business. For the year, we continue to expect stronger new construction activity across the country, driven by the housing recovery, MAP-21, state transportation initiatives and emerging commercial development activity. As a result, we expect shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase in the mid-single digits. We anticipate nonresidential end-use market growth in the high-single digits. Further recovery in the residential end-use market is expected to continue, and we anticipate double-digit growth in these shipments. Finally, we expect our ChemRock/Rail shipments to remain flat with 2012 levels. Cumulatively, we anticipate aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 6%. As a reminder, we experienced an unusual quarterly pattern of aggregate shipments in 2012, and comparisons with prior year periods may continue to be affected in subsequent quarters in 2013. We currently expect aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%. A variety of factors beyond our direct control may continue to exert pressure on our volumes, and our forecasted pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit. Increased production should generate operational efficiencies and lead to a modest reduction in aggregates product line production cost per ton compared with 2012. Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline slightly. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million. To conclude, we believe the current residential construction recovery is strengthening and will serve as a foundation and catalyst for a much broader recovery in general construction activity. We also feel the first quarter's challenging weather-related operating conditions have masked more positive macro trends that will become more clearly visible over the course of the year. We look forward to capitalizing on these trends and enhancing long-term shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials, if the operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnold Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: I guess my question again, if you could expand a little more, you spoke in some detail about why you're optimistic for the year, but you did start with a pretty big hole in the ground at the beginning, an 8.8% decline, and yet you're reiterating a 4% to 6% volume improvement. Can you highlight some of the things that give you confidence that, that will occur?
C. Howard Nye: Sure. If we take a look at the way volumes went through the first quarter, they were down 5% in January, 7% in February and just about 13% in March. As you recall, Arnie, part of what we said for average, really, the last 2 weeks in March can make or break the first quarter. So if we're sitting here taking a look at this year's first quarter or, really, the history, it only ends up being around 17% of the volume that we have during the course of the full year. So if we'd look at the trends that we saw in the first quarter and then, frankly, come back and even see what the trends need to be for the next several quarters to get us to our range, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I mean, down 8.8% in Q1, for us to come out where we'd like to be, realistically, we need volumes up around 10% in the second quarter, around 15% in the third quarter, and we could actually see a flat-to-down quarter in Q4 and still be very comfortable with that range. So I think as we look at Q1 on a comparative basis and what we feel like the compares will be in Q2, 3 and 4, we feel pretty comfortable with that 2% to 4% that we have out there.
Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.: That's very helpful. My second question relates to the vertically integrated businesses. You surprisingly got some terrific price increases that I know you were hoping to get, but it seems like you've achieved them. The question I have is, as you mentioned some delays in work due to weather and some other factors, the increases that you've gotten, when are they likely to be impacting the work you have? When will you get the benefit of those price increases?
C. Howard Nye: Effectively, Arnie, the increases are in now as we're looking forward to the year. So what we've talked about is what we're recognizing or realizing to date. Part of what I've indicated, I think, on the call that we had at the end of the year last year, talking about this year, is I thought we would likely see even more midyear price increases than we've seen in the last couple of years. Obviously, we'll have a better feel for that when we speak next, after the next quarter results. But I think the price increases that we're talking about now, we are clearly going to reap the benefit of here over the next several quarters. Now in fairness, we did have -- and as I said in my remarks, we did have some benefit of some mix changes in those numbers as well. To put some direction to that, it's about 150 bps worth of change in the Southeast and 200 in the West. But one reason I like that, Arnie, is I see it going, really, to more clean stone in both of those markets, which tells me that we're seeing more ready mixed concrete activity. And what I would suggest to you is that has been the single weakest part of heavy side building materials now for a number of years. And the reason that I cite that is if ready mixed continues to get more healthy, I think we'll continue to see good movement on pricing in that space. I think it also gives pricing power in the other spaces as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: Just to take an additional step with the pricing question, pricing, obviously, up in all markets is positive. But how much of the West pricing was driven by success in Texas versus Colorado, which has been a relatively lower price market and I know a market that you've been placing a great deal of focus and increasing overall pricing, not just in aggregates, but in your downstream products?
C. Howard Nye: Kathryn, we clearly did see strength in Texas, but the good news is we're seeing strength in Colorado as well. If I'm looking on the downstream side in Colorado, we start ready mixed pricing up there 9% in Colorado, so nice strength in that, seeing asphalt up 6%. And obviously, we did have good momentum in Texas as well. So what I would suggest to you is, while Texas, in some respect, led it relative to the aggregates piece of it, the downstream activity that we're seeing and the pricing that we're seeing is pretty good in Colorado right now.
Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC: What is the likelihood of a midyear price increase for aggregates and for downstream products? And how much of this increase would be driven by a higher cost versus just an increase in overall demand?
C. Howard Nye: Kathryn, I think the chances for midyear price increases are better this year than they've been in the last couple of years. Now, at the same time, we're early in the year, and part of what I always remind people, it's very difficult to take results in Q1 and try to extrapolate them to a full year. So I put that caution there. But I would still say I think they can be broader in our footprint than they were last year. If I look at the cost side, if from a practical perspective, at this point, Kathryn, the costs are remaining in pretty good shape. If you can tell me what you think is going to happen to energy, I can probably give you a better answer on what may happen with some of the pricing. But as we're looking right now, the energy piece of it has been pretty well behaved.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Your -- I guess being repetitive, but on pricing, again, your prices are up 5.7% in the quarter, and your guidance is 2% to 4% for the year still. Is part of that product mix, too, in terms of we get into the paving or the highway construction season, which is really an April-to-October season, and that's typically a lower average price? Is that part of the complexion of the pricing guidance too?
C. Howard Nye: Jack, that very much is part of the complexion. The nature of some of the jobs may change as we go through the year. So keep in mind, if you see more dirt work, and you see more new construction, it will mean more base, and you'll actually have a headwind relative to mix at that point. And I think it goes back to what I've said before, it's still early in the year, and while those trends look right, right now, and I think they're going to be good, I think we're just being cautious as we go forward here, Jack.
Anne H. Lloyd: Jack, this is Anne. If you take a look at the product mix impact for the Aggregates business as a whole, it was about 123 bps in the first quarter.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Is that a comparison versus the first quarter last year?
Anne H. Lloyd: Absolutely. Look at a mix -- so you got -- so that's what you picked up in the first quarter from a move from base to claims.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Right. Got it. Okay. First -- Q1. And your guidance, too, on demand says -- or implies mid-single-digit improvement in the highway sector, public works sector. And Q1 is the throwout quarter for that sector, so volume's down 10% or 12%. It doesn't matter, but that's still a little better than what some of the industry forecasts are. Say, ARPU's [ph] up 3% or so. What gives you confidence that you guys can do a little better than sort of the industry forecasts?
C. Howard Nye: I guess a couple of things, Jack. One, it's where we are, so I would come back to the where. So if we begin with the notion that we're going to have $9 billion worth of bidding in Texas, I mean, that is twice what we saw last year, and people thought last year was pretty good. We had a record DOT budget in Iowa last year, and the DOT budget in Iowa this year is bigger than last year. Obviously, we talked a little bit about what the RAMP program is going to mean in Colorado. We think that's going to be a very attractive marketplace for us. We're seeing improved activity in Florida. Again, their DOT budget is up 72% year-over-year. So when we take a look at those states that can be impact states for us, it certainly gives us confidence. The other thing that's giving me some confidence are some of the McGraw-Hill numbers that, literally, have just come out this week, which I think very much reinforce the guidance. In '13, the total change in construction that they continue to speak to is around 8%. In non-res, they're seeing up 6%; and in residential, 26% up. So they're seeing housing starts very much knocking and staying at that million level this year. And what even makes me feel better, I know this isn't necessarily your question, Jack, but as I look at what their forecasts indicate for '14 and '15, I'm seeing 2014, at least according to McGraw-Hill, up 18%; and 2015, up 20%. So I think when we take a look at the states in which we have a significant presence, take a look at what we feel like it's been some of the latest forecast that have come out, literally, within the last week from McGraw-Hill and take a look at what we think the trajectory is going forward. I think that gives some nice book-ends to all of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Ward, I'm wondering if you can provide some more context around what gives you the confidence around double-digit volume growth in the second and third quarter. Maybe you could step us through backlog, or maybe I'm reaching, but perhaps, you could tell us what April is looking like.
C. Howard Nye: I'll tell you more about April when we're together on this next call. But what I'll say, Jerry, if you think to what last year looked like, I mean, we came out of the gate with great vigor last year in the first quarter because we really didn't have a winter, and I think therein lies the story on what the delta is this year with respect to volumes. At the same time, as you think back to what we were also faced with in the second and third quarter last year, after we got into that early spring period, we really just hit wall in large respects with respect to aggregate volume, I think, because we were suffering from last year what we're not suffering from this year, and that was -- you had an enormous overhang from the election, and you had a great deal of uncertainty, particularly around commercial construction last year. And I think people were still trying to get their head around wholly, whether housing was back or not or whether that was a head fake. So I think if we take a look at where housing is now, and of course, you saw the March number... [Audio Gap] We're seeing commercial absorption late last year at 207,000 square feet just taken during the fourth quarter. That's the best number in that respect since 2007. Industrial vacancy in that community is below 10% right now. If we take a look at what's going on in Houston, it's got faster growth in Houston than any other large metro in the United States. So if they're looking at what they anticipate their CAGR to be from 2012 to 2017, they're looking at 5%. But here's what I'm particularly bolstered by, when we start looking, too, at North Texas, Jerry, because if you think about it, so much of what's been going on in South Texas has been energy-driven. And now what we're seeing in the first quarter in North Texas, in the Metroplex, Dallas-Fort Worth, is strong office leasing with a net 1.4 million square feet let in Q1. That's versus a negative 40,000 during the same period last year. Single-family construction in Dallas is at the highest level in 5 years. So it was up 35% from the prior year quarter. And right now, even in the Metroplex, which should -- had trailed, what we're seeing in San Antonio and in Houston, there are only around 3.5 months of inventory left on housing. So as we come back and take a look at what we see in infrastructure and commercial and that type of housing growth, and we take a look at what the numbers looked like last year in Q2 and Q3, I think those are the things that gives us the type of confidence that we have that we'll hit the volume projections that we have out there.
Anne H. Lloyd: If they're going to step up just to a little higher level, and look at volume growth or absolute volumes in the last 3 quarters of 2012 versus in 2011, that ranged from about 102 to 104 million tons that we shipped during those 3 quarters. And with the actual results in the first quarter and our guidance of 4% to 6% for the year, that infers that we need about 110 or 112 million tons to actually meet the guidance's expectations, which, as Ward indicates, really not a whole lot of volume given the strong underlying fundamentals.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And how would you characterize visibility and lead times in your business kind of compared to this time a year ago?
C. Howard Nye: It feels considerably better than it did a year ago. I think when we were coming out of this period last year, there was a higher degree, in my mind, of uncertainty around where construction was. And I think, again, that's part of what's driving the reinforcement of the end-uses and forecasts that McGraw-Hill just came out with this, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And in terms of midyear pricing, obviously, at this point in the cycle, you've -- when you've got the pricing momentum that you just reported here, presumably there are some markets where you're going to look to put in midyears in. Can you give us a sense on what proportion of your markets you're optimistic on additional pricing actions sticking at midyear?
C. Howard Nye: You know what Jerry, I will clearly go into more detail on that when we get to half-year. I think what's attractive about it right now is we're seeing up volume just about everywhere over the last couple of years, where it's been spottier. I would tell you to follow the volume. This year, with the volume trends that we're seeing, I do think they can be more widespread, but that's probably as specific as I want to be right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: It seems that these levels of production, the incremental tonnage, really, has some significant impacts on gross margin. So my question is, if you hit your guidance or the middle of the pricing and volume guidance for the year, what should we expect the full year gross margins to be around, in let's just say the aggregates business?
C. Howard Nye: If we do that, depending on where the volume comes, I think we would start seeing the type of incremental volume margin expansion that we've been talking about, Adam. I think one of the biggest issues that we will face, and I think the industry will face, as volume comes back is where it's going to come back. And while volume has been good across the enterprise, what you're clearly seeing is still a much healthier business in the West right now than in the East. So if it continues to be that way, that's going -- it won't push them down, it just simply makes it more challenging. Part of what I am taking some comfort in right now, though, is relative to what's happening in jobs in a number of different markets. And I think this goes directly to your margin question. North Carolina, on unemployment rates, has been sitting at #47 in the country now for a while at 9.2%. Now for the first time here, as we're really coming into March, and I'm looking at the Martin Marietta states, I'm seeing year-over-year employment rates in North Carolina for the first time moving ahead of a national average. And if we're seeing that type of economic activity here and more tonnage here, it's going to come back and help us seriously address the margin issue.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. My second question is, if I think back when we've talked about weather before, my memory seems to suggest that you may -- I think you may have said that weather -- you'd always feel that it comes back, the lost volume from weather. Does that -- am I correct in remembering that?
C. Howard Nye: I think it wholly depends on the time of year. But I think when you've got a weather impact in Q1, I think all it does is it pushes it to the right. So I think we can take a high degree of confidence that we're going to have a shortened construction season, but I don't think that's going to end up being problematic for the industry this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I was hoping to touch on, first, the margins in Aggregates. Obviously, we saw a really impressive pricing, up 6%, which I think gives you $17 million of revenue and profit benefit. Revenue is down $9 million, gross profit is down $9 million, which gives you some pretty sharp decrementals, admittedly, on down volumes. But -- and could you maybe give us the bridge you've historically provided to help us understand kind of the puts and takes that drove the change in gross profit?
Anne H. Lloyd: As you look at the aggregates product line, it's gross profit were down $9.4 million collectively, pricing strength contributed about $13 million, volume weakness took away about $22.5 million, and our costs were essentially a cush. So that $9 million, $9.4 million, essentially, just dropped straight to the bottom line, and it all came from volume.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So would my math be right to say that costs per ton were up almost 10% year-on-year?
Anne H. Lloyd: They weren't up 10%, they were up slightly, and that would infer then that, again, our variable costs didn't move a whole lot. And the reality for the first quarter is that, for the first time in several beginnings of construction seasons, we actually did some planned grading. We uncovered and moved about 18% more, about 1 million more cubic yards of dirt actually unearthed, some reserves to be prepared for the construction season, and that did affect the cost structure in the quarter. And really, our production didn't decline either. Actually our production numbers, in preparing for what's coming up in the season, were strong. And if I go back and look at the relationship to production, to shipments, it's in line with what we had historically seen as the start of a strong volume builds. So we feel real comfortable with the cost structure. But you're right, I don't think the number was up 10%, but it was up slightly.
C. Howard Nye: Ted, let me give you a little more color to that because I think this will be helpful. If you look last year, in Q1, we used about 6.1 million gallons of diesel. To Anne's point -- this quarter, around 6.9 million gallons. With basically the same tonnage, that goes to Anne's point on what we were doing, moving about a million more cubic yards in stripping activities. And importantly, when we come back and take a look at what we're doing relative to productivity on tons produced per working man-hour, they remained almost the same from Q1 last year to Q1 this year, and keep in mind, operating in a much different and better Q1 last year than this year. So to have that degree of productivity maintained, I thought it was actually quite good.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Can you probably [ph] share that tons per hour, what that metric was on year-on-year?
C. Howard Nye: I typically don't give the exact number on that for competitive reasons but -- I publish that very carefully, but I can tell you it was almost spot on to where it was last year, Ted.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. The other thing I was hoping to touch on is, could you just help us -- and I apologize if I missed this, but maybe just walk through the volumes at the state level for your biggest states, kind of Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, at the state level, what those numbers look like?
C. Howard Nye: You didn't miss anything on that, and actually, I'll give you at least a quick color on that. I'll go through some of the districts. If we're taking a look at just the Midwest Division, and really, that's important because they had a great quarter last year, that's where it was over 50 degrees, volume there for the quarter, Ted, was down about 16%. And again, that's one of those districts that I was talking about had a record DOT program last year, a bigger one this year. So volume down 16%, you feel like that's almost entirely weather-driven. At the same time, you come back and take a look at different districts in Texas, volume actually up in the Houston district all by itself, that's not surprising. You've got good weather there, volume actually up in North Texas. So we look at those as really 2 very different markets. At the same time, you come back and take a look at North Carolina West, meaning Greensboro, and that area, volumes down there, indicative of a pretty tough winter. And if we look even in North Georgia, again a very difficult winter, volumes down there around 11%. So those are the types of percentages that I very much would have expected with the weather we've had this year compared to last year. But that gives you some real specificity in some live markets.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And the last thing, I just wanted to come back to a comment I thought I heard Anne make in response to one of Jerry's questions, where you said that you thought that the implied target you'd have to hit in the remainder of the year were -- my interpretation to what you said is it really wasn't a stretch. So is there a potential we can infer that to suggest that your volume guidance, the risk bias is skewed to the upside?
Anne H. Lloyd: I wouldn't say that. We're usually pretty pragmatic about the guidance that we give. Our view of the 4% to 6% is reasonable. But obviously, with the depth of the volume decline in the first quarter, we've wanted to relook it to make sure that not only did our forecasts hold up, but that it actually seemed logical that -- given the fundamentals of the market. So on average, we would have to see volumes up, on average, 7% to 9% through the back half, back 3 quarters of the year to meet our targeted 4% to 6%. Do I think there's a risk to the upside? I hope so, but it's still a long 5 years. We'll see.
C. Howard Nye: We'll take that risk, Ted.
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes, we'll take that risk. That's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: When you're looking at your -- at the different states that you guys have that are disproportionately important from a margin standpoint, they've been definitely -- at least several of them have been lagging. It sounds like you're seeing some things that might point to some optimism in those states. But as you kind of look at your guidance, with the -- being decent improvement we're seeing in volume or expected to see in volume, how does that sort out for those disproportionately important states from a margin standpoint, and your expectation for those relative to the guidance you've given?
C. Howard Nye: I think part of what we're seeing right now, Trey, is we think those states that are disproportionately important, at least some of them have found bottom, and we think they're improving. I think that's really important. And candidly, that's part of what we saw as we were looking at the acquisition that we made in North Georgia as well. I mean, here's some things to think about. If we look at construction employment across the United States, in Texas, which everyone gets is in a great place right now, we're seeing 5 -- 5.6% change positively year-over-year. But if I suddenly come back and take a look at South Carolina, it's 3.5% positive year-over-year, as is Georgia, as is Florida. So we're starting to see construction jobs come back in that bottom right-hand corner on the map that we keep drawing a circle around. Now North Carolina, as we said, continues to lag on construction employment. At the same time, when I'm looking at overall employment trends, North Carolina, for the first time now in years, has gone ahead of the national average. So if we look at those type of statistics, and we start looking at some of the jobs and work that's out there, particularly as we start heading into '14, it certainly gives us much greater confidence in the southeastern U.S.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. So it's reasonable to think that North Carolina, for example -- that North Carolina, it's reasonable to think that it could continue to maybe trail the overall average, but maybe the expectation is to see more, maybe it outpaces as we look into '14, and that's when we could really see some big margin improvement coming from that region?
C. Howard Nye: Trey, I think that's exactly the way to look at it. I mean, if you look at it right now, it has a work plan in 2013 that's 14% positive. But again, I think that's going to have more forward view to it than significant near term. So I think the way that you captured it in your words is entirely correct.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: All right. And then I guess the last question is more kind of longer term, how to think about pricing. Given all the changes that we've seen in the industry throughout the last 10 years and through this downturn, and I understand it's early, but I mean, next year, in some of the numbers you threw out there, it's reasonable to expect some pretty significant volume improvements as we look at '14 and beyond. But in that kind of environment, with some of those numbers, just hypothetically, if those numbers kind of shake out, what could we or should we be thinking about? I mean, if you guys are putting up this kind of price through this downturn, what should we be thinking about as a pricing range in a much more robust type of environment for as far as demand goes?
C. Howard Nye: Trey, that's a great question. And part of what I celebrate is I think we finally have put it to the acid test with respect to pricing historically. So I think we'll celebrate that here for a moment. Here's the way that I think I'd think about that, Trey, and I think we're seeing it to a degree with what we've put up this year. Part of what we have really given some thought to, is as these volumes continue to grow, particularly as they grow in advance of 5% per annum, I don't think it's going to be unusual for you to have pricing that's on a percentage basis. It's going to stick relatively close to that with a bit of a lag. So let's talk about -- let's use easy math. Let's say volume is up 10% next year. If the theory is correct, you could see them 7.5%, 8%, that's the type of lag that I'm talking about. So I think depending on how you think volumes will be and how elastic you feel like that may be, that's how I would be working with that model.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I don't think you gave the actual number for the decline in infrastructure. Maybe I missed it, and by the way, I apologize I got cut off for a minute. Can you give me that number in the first quarter?
C. Howard Nye: As far as the tonnage that went to infrastructure, the down, it was also less [ph] than 5%. So it was 42% of our volumes. Commercial was 33%, Res was 14% and ChemRock/Rail was 11%.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the -- just to comment at a question that a couple of people would follow up on different ways, you talked about how you can still get to the annual volume guidance despite the first quarter being soft. And you talked about that if you're up 10% in the second quarter, up 15% in the third quarter, you can be flat to down in the fourth quarter. Is there a reason to actually think that you're going to be flat to down in the fourth quarter? Or is that just sort of giving an example?
C. Howard Nye: That's really just more using an example. If you think about it, last year, Todd, Q4 actually went on pretty long. So actually, the way that I've just kind of modeled it out of my head, we could be down as much as 3% in Q4 if you wanted to say, winter would come in early, if you had a good Q2 and a good Q3. So I think it just depends on how you want to really put the numbers at the end of those rather than in the middle. But I think you're clearly looking at double digits up in Q2 and Q3 if you want to make the 4% to 6% up. And again, based on what those quarters look like, I don't think that's a huge stretch, Todd.
Anne H. Lloyd: Just as a reminder, Todd, remember volumes were actually down in the third quarter last year because of all the uncertainties surrounding the economy.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Sure. Okay. On the pricing side -- and again, I was cut off, so if I missed this, I apologize -- but I can't help but notice that the 5.7% increase in price in the first quarter is a larger numeral than 2% to 4%, which is your guidance for the full year. I mean, was there that much mix in there? You talked some about the mix effect. But was there that much of a mix effect in there?
C. Howard Nye: First of all, I complement you, you don't miss a thing. Todd, no, I mean, there was some mix effect. And to give you, it was 123 bps rolled up. If you want to break it down, it's about 150 for the Southeast and 200 in the West. And to really give you some sense on the way that the mix worked, in the Southeast, we went from 40% base last year to around 30% base this year. And in the West, we went from 49% clean stone last year to 56% clean stone this year. So that, at least, was the mix play that was in there. Even if you take that mix number out, I mean, still, pricing was very healthy for the quarter. I will certainly concede that. I would simply come back and say it's the first quarter. It's January, February, March. Do I like what I've seen on pricing? Yes. Do I think it could be awfully good? Yes, I think I probably do. Am I going to be cautious and say let's give this some time? You bet.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Understood. Understood all that. And then switching gears talking about Specialty Products. Can you quantify the impact of that customer bankruptcy just in terms of -- with however you want to look at it?
C. Howard Nye: Yes, it was Feris Point [ph]. And here's the way to think about it, Todd. They went into bankruptcy last year in May, which tells you that, as a practical matter from a month's perspective, we've already weathered, really, the worst of that. From a sales perspective, call it, probably $3 million worth of sales last year.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: For the sales last year, not in the first quarter?
C. Howard Nye: In the quarter.
Anne H. Lloyd: In the quarter.
L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it. So is this -- is the quarterly -- the first quarter number that I realize you have some guidance out there, but is it sort of the run rate to anticipate? Or how is the kiln running? Is that a factor at this point to just run a full out?
C. Howard Nye: The kiln is running well. It's been debugged. It's running at a rate that we anticipated that it would. We feel very good about the way our business is looking right now in Woodville and Manistee. Our teams have done exactly what we would have hoped to and 10% more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Just given the slow start to the year in the downstream businesses, in part, because of weather. If my math is right, I think you need about 70% incremental margins to hit the midpoint of your full year profit guidance for the downstream businesses. So generally, these are lower incremental businesses. The way that we think about it, I was just wondering if you could walk us through a little bit on how you're thinking about the profit ramp in the downstream businesses. And is this mainly pricing-dependent given the strength in pricing that you're getting? Or is this something along the lines of a better operating leverage? Or is the plant level that's going to drive these incrementals higher?
C. Howard Nye: It's going to be both, Garik. I mean, clearly, we are anticipating that volumes would be better. I mean, so let's begin with that notion. At the same time, when we're sitting here right now with ASP up in ready mixed 9% and ASP up in hot mixed 6%, even the pace of, candidly, liquid moving down, those are pretty good numbers. To go back and give you a sense of at least what those volumes looked like last year, in San Antonio, on hot mixed, we did about 1 million tons; and in Denver last year, around 1.7 million. So that will -- and then do some rounding for the Arkansas business. If you think about what the ready mixed yards looked like in Colorado last year, around 1 -- almost 1.5 million. And in San Antonio -- I'm sorry, it's 1.5 million rolled up. In Rocky Mountain, it's around 930,000; and in San Antonio, around 0.5 million; and then call it 125,000-ish in Arkansas. That gives you a pretty good roll on the way those volumes will work. Obviously, the pricing isn't going to be the same in all of those markets, and we feel like some of those are more attractive than others. But again, the biggest single downstream component that we have right now is what we have in Colorado. And as we take a look at the way that, that business is performing right now and the way that we feel like that's going to work going forward, we've got a pretty high degree of confidence that Colorado is going to be where we'd like it to be here by the end of the year. We've got good bidding activity there, and we're seeing good residential activity, we're seeing good commercial activity, and we like the mix of business as well, separate and distinct from what's going on with the RAMP program in Colorado DOT.
Anne H. Lloyd: And Garik, I would add that I think what you're referring to is incremental margin there is -- remember a lot of that comes from the seasonality of the earnings pattern in that business because it is -- it is so Colorado in focused. You generally have losses that you carry in that business through probably the first 4, 5 months of the year, and you make all of your money in the last 6 or 7. So I think it's really more the seasonality of the earnings pattern that you're seeing as opposed to an incremental margin concept.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Some companies have been talking about ready mixed truck shortages. Some mentioned last week on their call. Other companies have been pointing to that as well. Just wondering if we can get your view on -- this could be a potential risk to your volume guidance. And the trucking shortages downstream might delay the timing of projects. And in turn, that might back up when you'll be shipping into some of these projects throughout the balance of the year. Is that a potential risk at all?
C. Howard Nye: Garik, I think it is a potential risk. I'm not sure I'd highlight this as an enormous risk right now, but I think it is a potential risk. In fact, if you take a look at the areas at which we actually produced more this year than last year, it was really in 2 pretty distinct places. We did that in South Texas, and we did that in portions of Colorado. Our sense was having that material on the ground and in a position to ship it earlier rather than later might be helpful for a variety of reasons, including trucking. So that inventory build was not accidental.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just lastly, you mentioned the pending deal with Lafarge in Atlanta. Just wondering if you can comment, Ward, just on your interest in the future acquisitions, specifically your interest at this point in smaller deals versus larger deals, potentially revisiting bulk-in or other large comparable bids at this point in time, Ward.
C. Howard Nye: Garik, the primary thing we're focused on right now is running our business exceptionally well, and I think our teams are doing that. And to the extent that we find transactions that we think build shareholder value, we're certainly going to look at those. I mean, one of the issues that we recognize is we do want to bring down our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and we've been very transparent about that. And if we can have that at a range of, say, 2.5x by year-end, I certainly wouldn't have my feelings hurt if that's where we found ourselves. Obviously, I think doing this Lafarge transaction makes an enormous amount of sense for us. If you take a look at the locations that we have in that Atlanta market and think of Atlanta as a clock, we've really bought some operations that are really between, say, 2:00 and 5:00 on that clock and over to the East. So if you remember what our strategic objectives are, and that's to find attractive markets and to have the #1 or #2 position in those markets, we think that's what we're accomplishing with this Lafarge transaction. And again, I think that's wholly consistent with entirely what we have been talking with the analyst and investment community about. And I think to the extent that we can do more of that, that's what you should expect us to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust.
Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. But just quickly on the Lafarge deal, can you give us some sort of indication as how large the revenue, what the profitability of those units would be?
C. Howard Nye: Keith, really, right now, pending the closing of it, I'm not in a position that I can do that. But I can tell you, it's Lithonia and it's Newton and it's Morgan County quarries, and you can probably get a sense of what volumes look like there.
Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And the close date, again, I think you mentioned it earlier.
C. Howard Nye: Actually, we didn't mention the actual date. We're looking to do that sometime very early in Q3.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies.
Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 questions for me. The first one is a follow-up on that Lafarge thing. I mean, they put out a press release in early January saying they were selling 6 quarries for $160 million in Georgia. Is your purchase part of that? And 800 million tons of assets, if it is, that seems a pretty attractive purchase price. Is any of these aggregates reserve not permitted or in a particular big block in one location?
C. Howard Nye: Number one, it was not part of that release, as I understand it, Mike. So this is separate, so it's not in those numbers. It is 3 locations. And the Lithonia location has the biggest single block of reserves, and I don't think there's any question about that. But the 800 million number that I've put out is the permitted reserves number.
Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just one for Anne on the SG&A and the IT cost of $4.6 million or so. Correct me if I'm wrong because I probably am, I thought the additional cost of that program was running at kind of like $1 million a quarter. Was it something specific exceptional in Q1 or if you brought the cost forward? Or maybe like a bit more explanation on that would be useful.
Anne H. Lloyd: Yes, Mike. The core information systems upgrade project is about running at $1 million a quarter, plus or minus a couple hundred thousand, every quarter, depending on the timing. So we did have a renegotiation of our Oracle license in the first quarter of 2013. That was a onetime charge of $2 million that you'll see. That is -- part of those costs. That will provide us with a platform that is much more scalable. But that won't recur in the second quarter. You should see it get back to about $1 million a quarter.
C. Howard Nye: In fact, Mike, it shouldn't recur anytime soon for a while.
Anne H. Lloyd: Not for a while.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye: Again, thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call and for your interest in our company. We are optimistic about our business opportunities for the rest of this year, and we really look forward to discussing second quarter 2012 results with you in July. Thanks for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Q4 2012 and Full-Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining the Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’re pleased to report both our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results. Additionally, we’ll provide observations into expectations for 2013. As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the SEC’s website. Any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings. Finally, the corporation’s 2012 consolidated operating results should be evaluated mindful of our December 2011 asset exchange transaction which provided us with an entry into the markets in and around Denver, Colorado. Where appropriate, we have provided analysis to highlight this impact. We were pleased to finish 2012 the same way we started with growth in both heritage aggregates product line shipments and average selling price compared with the prior year quarter. Our quarterly heritage volume growth of 5% was attributable to improvement in infrastructure, non-residential and residential construction activity with notable strength in the latter two. We also received another strong contribution from the specialty products business, which is operating at capacity and generated $15.8 million of operating earnings. On a consolidated basis, aggregates volume growth and the performance of the specialty products business were the significant drivers of quarterly earnings of $0.46 per diluted share. Earnings per diluted share included a $0.04 impact from restructuring initiatives completed during the quarter. The non-residential and residential end-use markets each achieved 13% growth in heritage aggregates product line shipments compared with the prior year quarter. The non-residential market, our second largest end-use comprised 31% of quarterly shipments and had volume growth in both the energy and commercial construction sectors. The majority of energy sector shipments generates from our West Group which continued the benefit from ongoing oil and natural gas activity at the Eagle Ford Shale deposit in South Texas. Growth in commercial construction, namely office and retail was evident in our Southeast and West Group’s during the quarter. We believe commercial construction is beginning to benefit from sixth consecutive quarters of residential growth. Generally, expansion in the commercial component of non-residential construction usually lags 12 to 18 months behind the residential construction market. The residential construction market itself is rebounding with a level of growth not seen since 2005. December’s seasonally adjusted annual housing starts of 954,000, up 34% over prior year provide an encouraging sign for 2013 prospects. While the pace of residential recovery varies by market, strength was notable in our West Group, particularly in Texas and Colorado. The infrastructure in these market increased nearly 2% during the quarter representing around 49% of our quarterly heritage aggregates product line shipments. Importantly, infrastructure’s contribution to our total shipment volume is moving more in line with historical averages; another indicator of an improving overall construction market. As expected, we see tangible signs the infrastructure market is poised to benefit from various federal and state sponsored initiatives including the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21. For example, federal highway obligations, a leading indicator of highway construction activity increased 91% in the quarter ended December 31st when compared with the corresponding period of the prior year. While this rate of obligation improvement will no doubt moderate if nonetheless represents the highest level of obligations since fiscal 2010. This suggests increased highway award activity as the spring 2013 construction season begins. We also continue to monitor applications for funding provided by the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act or TIFIA. Several of our key states including Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia have applied for TIFIA funds to support key infrastructure initiatives. Through January 4th, the U.S. Department of Transportation received applications for 27 projects with a cumulative value of more than $38 billion; over one-third of the dollar value of these projects is in Martin Marietta served markets. While TIFIA related construction projects could begin as early as the second half of this year, we believe the more meaningful impact will began in 2014. We continue to be encouraged by various state initiatives designed to increase funding for infrastructure projects. As discussed in a February 6th, Wall Street Journal article, governors and legislatures across the country are increasingly coming to grips with the reality that their infrastructure problems have been compounded by decades of under funding and delay in construction and renovation of roads, bridges and other central infrastructure such as utilities. Against that backdrop, the State of Colorado recently passed the Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnerships or Ramp program, potentially increasing infrastructure funding $1.5 billion over the next five years. Virginia’s governor proposed transportation funding overhaul that could have provided an estimated $3 billion for highways, rail and transit systems in the next five years. The plan was approved by the Virginia House of Delegates, but effectively tabled by the Senate sending the governor back to the drawing board for creative solutions to the State’s transportation challenges. However, in news since our earnings release this morning, the Virginia State Senate Finance Committee has an amended version of the Transportation Funding Bill. If enacted, the Senate’s proposal to generate an estimated $4.5 billion over the next five years. Like Virginia, Governor’s across the United States are looking for answers to meet local transportation needs. Not surprisingly though the State’s with such initiatives in place are outpacing the nation in highway contract awards. For example, we are very encouraged by significant increase in Texas lettings, nearly $9 billion more than double prior year. Conversely, some States including South Carolina are experiencing budget constraints negatively affecting infrastructure commitments. The State of Indiana has also seen a decline in contract awards reflecting the waning impact of the state’s multi-year major moves initiative.  To complete the discussion of our end-use markets, heritage aggregates product line shipments to the ChemRock and Rail end-use was down 3% compared with the strong prior year quarter. Consistent with trends noted earlier in 2012, declines in both coal traffic on the railroads and track maintenance resulted in lower ballast shipments. This reduction was partially offset by increased agricultural lime shipments in our Midwest division triggered by an unseasonably warm and dry weather during the quarter.  We achieved heritage aggregates product line shipment growth in each of our reportable groups. However, the rate of improvement varies geographically. Led by energy sector and residential growth in Texas, the West Group reported an 8.7% increase in heritage aggregates volumes over the prior year quarter. The Southeast Group had a 1.7% increase with notable infrastructure growth in Florida being partially offset by a reduction of shipments at our offshore operations.  Finally, our Mideast Group generated a 1.2% increase in Heritage shipments. Strengths seen in the Charlotte, North Carolina market was largely offset by reductions in Virginia and West Virginia. Overall, we achieved a 1% increase in heritage aggregates product line average selling price led by 2.9% improvement in the Southeast Group. Pricing growth reflects both increases implemented during the year and the effects of product mix.  Inclusive of acquisitions, our overall average selling price declined slightly reflecting the impact of our Denver based business. As a reminder, aggregates product line pricing at our Colorado operations is lower than our heritage business due to market maturity, product mix and the vertically integrated nature of everything market.  In response to high demand, we increased heritage aggregates product line production by 6%. Despite an increase of $0.11 or 4% in the average paid per gallon of diesel fuel, our operations personnel maintained their focus on cost control and leveraged higher volumes to reduce heritage aggregates product line production costs per ton by 2%.  Notably, this reduction reflects the 13% increase in productive efficiency as measured by tonnes produced for working man hour. We believe these trends demonstrate the potential for future cost synergies as shipment volumes continue to recover.  The specialty products business generated quarterly net sales of $50.6 million, inclusive of $3 million generated by new kiln at the Woodville, Ohio facility which became operational on November 1. Effective cost management led to an operating margin of 31% for the quarter.  For the full year, this business established new records with net sales of $202.2 million, gross profit of $77.2 million and earnings from operations of $68.5 million. Gross margin continues to reflect the increased impact of vertically integrated businesses. That is our ready mix concrete, hot mixed asphalt and related road paving businesses in Arkansas, Colorado and Texas.  For the quarter, consolidated gross margin was 16.7%. Excluding the impact of vertical integration, consolidated gross margin would have been 19.4%, a 270 basis points increase over the reported metric. As the percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points to 8.3%. On an absolute basis, the $6.3 million SG&A increase reflects the threefold impact of a $3.3 million restructuring charge, $1.8 million of cost related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be complete later this year and overhead at our Colorado operations. As previously mentioned, organizational changes completed during the quarter to streamline our management structure in 2013 should reduce ongoing annual SG&A expenses by more than $3 million. Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $40.1 million compared with $20.7 million in the prior year quarter. Recall that 2011 quarterly earnings reflected $15 million of business development expenses. We continue to generate significant cash flow and for the year, cash provided by operating activities was $223 million. This sum includes a $38 million cash outlay for business development expenses and $23 million to fund working capital requirements at our Colorado operations.  During the year, we made prudent capital investments of $151 million, reduced our outstanding debt by $12 million, contributed $33 million to our pension plans and maintained our dividend rate of $1.60 per common share. At year end 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt-to-consolidated EBITDA was 3.21 times compliant with the limits under debt covenant. Our 2012 performance along with the positive trends we are seeing in our end-use markets suggest that our current momentum will continue in 2013.  We expect more new construction activity in 2013 driven by MAP-21, TIFIA and other state sponsored programs. As a result, we expect shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase in the mid single-digits. The Architecture Billings Index or ABI a leading economic indicator of non-residential construction spending reflects the strongest growth in billings at architecture firms since the end of 2007.  Accordingly, we anticipate non-residential end-use market growth in the high single-digits. Further, recovery in the residential end-use market is expected to continue and we anticipate double-digit growth in these shipments.  Finally, we expect our ChemRock and Rail shipments to remain flat with 2012 levels. Cumulatively, we anticipate heritage aggregates product launch shipments to increase 4% to 6%. As a reminder, we experienced unusually moderate weather in the first five months of 2012 allowing an earlier than normal start to the construction season in many of our markets.  If we experience more typical winter weather in 2013, our quarterly pattern of aggregates shipments and earnings may differ compared with 2012. In particular, 2013 first quarter results would be compared with a strong quarter in 2012. We currently expect heritage aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%, a variety of factors beyond our direct control may continue to exert pressure on our volumes and our forecasted pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit. Increased production should generate operational efficiencies and lead to modest reduction in aggregates product line direct production cost per ton compared with 2012. Net sales for the specialty product segment should range from $220 million to $230 million generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are two key drivers for the segment. SG&A expenses as percentage of net sales are expected to decline slightly. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26% excluding the discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million.  To conclude, our team delivered solid performance during the year of erratic economic behavior and we are pleased with our 2012 results. Further, we look forward to building on current economic trends and external construction activity indicators pointing to increased activity in 2013. With our well placed assets, disciplined cost structure and our team’s track record of performance through the worst cyclical downturn in our industry’s history, I believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and enhance long-term shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions. We will turn our attention to address your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: My question relates to the west segment of your business which had very strong growth 8.7%, can you give us a better sense of a spread between Texas and Colorado and then I have some follow-up questions related to Texas.
Howard Nye: The primary growth would have been in the Texas group primarily in the southwest group. If we take a look at really what's driving much of that Arnie, construction in San Antonio was up remarkably, construction employment was up there 7% year-over-year. In 2012 they sold nearly 20,000 homes there, that was up 10% year-over-year. Eagle Ford volume all by itself for the quarter was up 33%. So these are the types of drivers that are really pushing that market pretty hard. We still anticipate even in 2013 to have around $28 billion of money flowing into the Eagle Ford. So we feel like the Eagle Ford was obviously very good in ’12. We think it will continue to be good in ’13.  I can give you similar numbers also for Houston and DFW. But those are really the primary drivers that we are seeing Arnie. Now at the same time, what we are seeing in Colorado is actually a very attractive story as well, and keep in mind you've got a Colorado DOT that has a budget around $600 million and coming in with the ramp program which is $1.5 billion over the next five years. You are basically adding 50% to the Colorado DOT budget as we go into 2013. So what we are seeing in Texas relative to home building, what we are seeing in Texas relative to non-res particularly in energy, and what we are seeing there in infrastructure is good, and what we are seeing in Colorado with respect to infrastructure for ramp and what we are seeing going on with respect to home building is also very attractive.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: My second question relates to a slide that you had in a conference that I think is pretty interesting particularly as we look out over the next two years and expect volume growth. In that chart you showed the four or five year impact of volume of in excess of $500 million on your EBITDA and its pretty interesting thinking of that number on the base of 329, which is where we ended last year. As we continue to ramp up volume over the next few years, given the structural changes in your business, how should we think about the EBITDA potential of your business in the next two years as volume improves. Obviously you won't get all 80 million tons back in two years, but how should we think about the incremental margin on the volume we are likely to get.
Howard Nye: I think you can think about it in several ways, number one, we talked about incremental margins and said what we thought it would be over the next 40 million tons, and we think that's going to be very, very powerful. That's simply getting back to your point Arnie about half of the volumes that we’ve lost. Here's some of the takeaways to think about; our headcount is considerably lower today than it was at our peak profitability. Our efficiency as measured by tons produced per working man hour is higher today than it was at peak profitability; and our average selling price is around $2.51 a ton higher today than it was at peak profitability.  So what that tells us is if we come back with a degree of volume that you are talking about, it will be remarkably powerful to this business. The other thing that I will tell you is, where that volume comes back is going to matter a lot. I mean clearly what we have seen this year is a very healthy at least on a relative basis Western United States and believe me we will take every bit of that. But the fact is we really need the eastern US to get healthy as well because that’s a higher margin business for us. Again we celebrate what's going on in the west, but when volume comes back, Arnie it’s going to be powerful. When volume comes back in the east, it's going to be particularly powerful.
Anne Lloyd: And I will add to that Arnie, you can take the State of North Carolina. If you look at our top five states, Texas, North Carolina, Iowa. North Carolina needs to come back more healthfully.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: On the west pricing is up 1.3% and you know Denver pricing is on average lower versus your other core market. What would a pricing been excluding Denver and how are you doing in that market in terms of some of your efforts to push up pricing?
Howard Nye: Pricing again, total rolled up pricing ex-Denver was actually up 1% when you bring Denver in. It takes them the total picture down. So that does give you a sense Kathryn of how much lower pricing is in Denver relatively speaking. To answer your question on that though, we're looking at price increases across all product lines in Denver. Keep in mind you got a couple of issues in Denver relative to aggregates. Number one, it tends to be more of a standing gravel market as oppose to a crush stone market, although we do have a crush stone presence there. So we're looking to raise prices on both sand and gravel, as well as the crushed stone. But Denver is one of the few markets as you recall that we also have a vertically integrated footprint there and we are also going on with price increases on ready mix concrete and hot mix as well. Again, we've gone in to Denver and what we feel like is a leadership position, and we feel like that leadership position means coming to that market and demonstrating discipline around what we are going to do relative to production and also looking to add some value to the product as well. 
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: That’s helpful. You also touched on seeing trades in the west market with energy, and we know that was going on in Texas. But you also talked a little bit about the Colorado. Could you clarify how much of this is driven by Bakken versus Niobrara or is it really too early for those Shale place for you to see any type volumes in the Colorado market? 
Howard Nye: What we will see increasing volumes in that Colorado market, I will tell you when we look at what shale volumes were for this year they were pretty close to 6 million tons and the biggest single slug of that was clearly coming out of the Eagle Ford. If I look at what was going on year-over-year, we clearly saw more activity in Niobrara in ‘12 then they would have seen in ‘11 and we anticipate more activity in Niobrara in ‘13 versus ’12. We see shipments in the Barnett relatively even year-over-year going into ‘13 and we feel like the Eagle Ford again it’s going to continue to be a very healthy place.  Keep in mind there were notions that Eagle Ford was actually going to back off a little bit in ‘12 and they didn’t. I think a lot of people feel like it may back off a little bit in ’13. I am not sure that we are ready to say that with $38 billion of infrastructure and otherwise going into that. If we look year-over-year as well even what we are going to see in the Mississippian which is a new formation relatively speaking will be more year-over-year. The only place I am seeing a little bit of a pull back is probably going to be in the Haynesville deposit which again is moving from a gas deposit to more of a wet deposit as you go from Arkansas, Louisiana down to South Texas. 
Anne Lloyd: And Kathryn while we moved some material into the Bakken early in our entry into the energy sector, we really aren’t getting much material in there, we are really concentrating on this other formation.
Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group: Okay, that is helpful, thank you. And my final question is really focused long gross margin then I will hop back in the queue. How should we think about gross margins particularly in the quarter in light, you had some nice volume increases and some pricing increase, how should we that you saw from year-over-year declines. Help us walk through, how we should think about quarter and how we should think about modeling going forward, thank you?
Howard Nye: Kathryn I think the primary weightage, we are going to have to think about that is we do simply have a largely vertically integrated component of our business that we’ve had historically. So if you want to look back at Heritage on hot mix, Heritage we used to have around 1.5 million tons of hot mix. With Denver this year we added on additional 1.7 million tons of hot mix. Traditionally Heritage we would have had around 550,000 cubic yards of ready mix, with Denver we added in excess of 900,000 cubic yards.  So as you look at that, it does change the mix of the business pretty considerably. Obviously if you take the vertically integrated component out, we indicated that the 270 basis point difference between 16.7% on the margin and the 19.4. The other thing I would mentioned to you, and it goes back to the comment that Anne, made a little while ago. If we look at the quarter for this year, we sold around $7 million tons of stone into southwest division. In same quarter last year, it was around $5.8 million tons the stone in the southwest division. So again, while we welcome and celebrate the tonnage in the West, that tonnage is not going to have the margin that you see in the East so I would suggest to you there's a geographic mix issue relative to that, I would suggest to you that the vertically integrated component is a bit different. And the other thing that I would say to you is you need to take a look at what the product mix itself was as well. As we look at the product mix there are a number of different products that I see pretty healthy tonnage movement in; we sold more sand in this quarter than we did last year, we sold more fill material this quarter than we did prior year. So I think what we discussed before, the vertically integrated component, the geographic mix and the product mix are the issues that principally drove the difference in the gross margin.
Anne Lloyd: But Kathryn if you look at the 270 basis points impact on the fourth quarter margin that Ward laid out, it ranged throughout the course of the year to be an impact of about 190 points at the low to a high of about 420. So its, the median really was about 270, but it will ebb-and-flow obviously with the peak impacts seen in the higher production quarters of the second and third.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Just to kind of follow on to the previous question on the vertical integration kind of the impact there. So you said Anne that the average was about 270 basis points impact for the year; when you kind of look at, you mentioned you are in a leadership position there, you’ve got price increases announced or would assume or have them planned for this year in ready-mix which looks like’s the biggest negative impact that you guys are coming out of that vertical integration, how do we think about that 270 on a full year basis as we look into 2013, should we expect that to improve with some of these things going on or about the same, how do we think about that?
Anne Lloyd: Yeah, Trey you definitely will see improvement in that degradation and again that was 270 points as a median for the year. It did fluctuate during the course of the year, but particularly as we see ready-mix pricing begin to take hold more strongly in all of our markets, I think you will begin to see that margin compression go away.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: And so on a run rate, are we looking at maybe the margin compression going away by the end of ’13 or it would take a little longer what's your thoughts there on timing?
Howard Nye: You know what Trey a lot of that's going to be driven by what happens, for example, with mid-year price increases this year. Keep in mind you only recover around 25% of those even when you put them in, any year, but I think measuring to see how much the price increases that we go up with at the beginning of the year matters and I think seeing what happens with mid-year is going to matter. I think depending on that you could see that compression pretty considerably by year-end.
Anne Lloyd: And just as a reminder Trey, I mean we are talking about the entire vertical business which includes Colorado, Texas and Arkansas, so you are going to look at the interplay in all of those markets.
Trey Grooms - Stephens:  And then on product mix, Ward you touched on that, do you guys kind of given your outlook for infrastructure and that sort of thing; I know you guys have touched on this in the past that with that you would anticipate selling more base rock when that starts to improve, when that end market starts to improve, you know so are you kind of thinking that this year 2013 you could see a mix shift, a product mix shift towards more base rock and if so kind of what the impact of that could be?
Howard Nye: I think we certainly could. I think we’re trying to capture some of that impact in what we put out there for you right now, Trey. So hopefully we've given that a little bit of a forecast going forward. And candidly, I hope we do. I mean if we see more base stone going out of the door, what that means is we're seeing more new projects and we're certainly seeing more planning on new projects right now. So that would be something that we would be delighted to talk with you during the course of the year, but we believe we’ve captured that in the two to four that we put out right now.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: And is that also reflective in the, you know, I think the wording was, that there was going to be a slight improvement in cost per ton; would that also be reflected there as well?
Howard Nye: It would, Trey.
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay, and then my last question Ward, I have kind of asked you this in the past, a couple of different ways, just kind of really trying to get an idea for timing, but you know, you’ve mentioned in the past when we're kind of looking at incremental, that you guys need to see, you know, an improvement across the enterprise and if you look at your guidance, at least by end market, it looks like everything with, I guess, with the exception of ChemRock and Rail, it's going to be up this year. Is that and I also know you need geographic impact, but kind of just all-in, when we look at 2013 and your expectation there, are we getting to a point where we can start to kind of think about that kind of incremental margin on aggregates when we look out this year?
Howard Nye: I think we're getting close to that period of time. Again, I think the disproportionate driver right now Trey, is going to be what happens in North Carolina and really what happens in places like Georgia and what happens in places like Alabama and Florida as well. If those places have some volume coming through particularly North Carolina, you are going to see those incremental margins very, very quickly. But again, the fact is when you are seeing even for a quarter, we saw for example, 15% volume growth in Indiana, so if we look at the Mideast, again, it’s a bit like Texas, I am going to celebrate everyday 15% volume up in Indiana. But the primary thing that I need right now and the organization needs is that same type of percentage growth in North Carolina; if we see that then the timing to your question becomes almost immediate. 
Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. I do want to sneak one more I am sorry, on the heritage price just for clarity of 2% to 4% that does not include Denver now, even though we are kind of anniversarying it; we are still kind of excluding that from the heritage; is that accurate? 
Howard Nye: It’s all in. 
Trey Grooms - Stephens: It’s all-in okay, perfect. Thank you for that clarity and good luck. Thank you. 
Howard Nye: Trey, it’s all-in; so once we eclipse the one year period after the acquisition of Denver, it counts as heritage. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Ward, can you talk about what your assumptions are for pricing in the downstream businesses; it looks like roughly you are guiding for 25% incremental margins in ’13, which I think implies little pricing and I am wondering if you could just flush out for us what you think about pricing conditions in those markets and how we should be thinking about potential price increases over the course of the year? 
Howard Nye: I can tell you, what we are looking at right now principally on ready-mix, for example in Colorado we have come out with anywhere from a $5 to a $6 cubic yard price increase in that market; so obviously we are hopeful that that will stick for the year. I think we will probably be looking at similar percentage type increases in Texas as well; we are looking at increases in hot mix as well for you know, keep in mind, much of that’s going to be driven by what may or may not happen with price of liquid as we go to the year relative to indexing. So I think you will clearly see pricing going up in hot mix is well whether it goes up at the same percentages that we are seeing in ready mix, I think it is an open question, but I’ll try to give you a pretty definitive advance particularly in the ready mix side of it in Denver right now.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: And in terms of the IT implementation, I don’t know if you could just talk about what sort of headwind that is in 2013 and does that roll out completely next year and any quantifiable benefit that we should think about heading into next year?
Howard Nye: You know Jerry, its [JDE] upgraded, basically what we said last year, we thought we spend around $1 million a quarter for last year and for this year, so clearly we anticipate that expense going away when we get here to the end of ‘13, and it just continues to help us keep our systems and what we feel like are leading edge because we feel like having that is also awfully important to manage and caution this business when your average selling price is less than $11 a ton.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Your comments on non-res for ‘13 are somewhat strong as I have heard; can you kind of talk about how you think the various submarkets of that are going to be or linked to this high single digit growth number?
Howard Nye: Yeah, as come back and look at Keith right now, I guess the primary thing that we are seeing is we are seeing considerably more office and retail and some industrial as well. And we started seeing the industrial in parts of even the Southeast last year and we started seeing that come back in markets like Charlotte in particular; we have seen relatively good industrial in parts of the Midwest. So again, we are seeing more activity outside of the pure energy right now; what I can tell you to believe though is we will see most of that occur in what we like to refer to as the commodity belt. So if you are looking at that middle portion of the country going from Texas up to Dakota, I think you are going to continue to see an industrial renaissance in that part of the world in large part because power is getting so cheap there that you've got a lot of people moving in from around the globe simply to participate in that and its following on, on what's happened in the residential. I mean, I think we can't underestimate how powerful res is right now on driving what's happening with non-res. So what we said and when I try to spell out in the commentary is we thought we would see that 12 to 18 month lag and by the time we get to have two in 2013 we should be very much into that.
Anne Lloyd: I think a differentiator for us has got to be our ability to get into the energy play particularly if you are looking at our sector. And that does drive good solid performance in non-res and the other component of that, I mean most our of shipments have been called what I would call direct shipments into the energy field but there's going to be indirect development that continues to go on around that, whether that would be in the infrastructure component or in the non-residential component just to support everything that goes on in and around the oil field services. 
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Are you starting to see [close] activity already coming in for these type of projects?
Howard Nye: Yeah we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: So I was hoping to talk about specialty products and maybe to start with the fourth quarter, on a reported basis it looks like revenue was down about 2%. I know you mentioned the kiln started November 1 and contributed about $3 million of revenue. So I think that would imply organic growth was down more like negative 8%.  So I'm just kind of curious what happened in the quarter on an organic basis? How we should think about 2013 and I want to know you mentioned that you are operating at capacity I was wondering if you could kind of help us understand a little bit better what that means in the context of what happened to the revenue in the quarter?
Howard Nye: Sure. Ted I think the primary thing to think about in this quarter is number one; you are really going through debugging in part on the new kiln that's there. So remember we are adding 275,000 tonnes of material coming out of the new kiln.  I think what we have been pretty much true to saying is we are going to add $20 million to $25 million of revenue at the types of margins that we've been accustomed to there. They are really going to vary somewhere call it $31 million to $34 million to $35 million, that's probably your zone.  I think one of the issues to remember in that business is when you are operating at capacity its just one or two small things that can really serve to move that margin a little bit one way or the other, a little bit of volume at one plant may do that, a large maintenance and repair project may do that as well. So as we are looking at that business again, we feel very comfortable A that the project is done and its operating the way that we would wish and that we have a year set up for next year that will be right in line with the type of estimates that we've had.
Anne Lloyd: But on the revenue line, Ted, if you look there were a couple of items that were driving there, you were correct we did have $3 million of pick up from the new kiln because the guys delivered that project just beautifully. We did have lower (inaudible) sales in our specialty business that (inaudible) is a product that's used to line the refractory mix instead of kiln and then we did have some impact of the bankruptcy of RG Steel that effected the sales.
Howard Nye: And the last thing I would note for you as well is if you look at the month of December for steel capacity utilization, it pulled back to around 71.7 and if you look back at the same point in December 2011, it was a 75.2. So you saw a significant pull back in steel utilization for the month and at the same time what I will tell you is snap back to around 75% in January and as I am looking at the forecast for steel going forward, it started out in the year thinking it would probably be up around 4% to around 120 million short tonnes and I think with the slow start where they saw at least coming out of last year, many are saying it's probably going to be up around 3% for a 100 million tonnes.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: So more of transient factors?
Anne Lloyd: You got it. I mean that core business running at capacity means that it can even flow but it should be with transient factors, it's something permanent in the core business.
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay, on the incremental gross margins of specialty products, let’s say they came in, or guidance I am sorry, would imply that 25% of the midpoint and over the last two years or three years, they’ve been kind of in a 50% to 70% range. So, as we think about 2013, is this just layering on the new capacity? Is this a price cost issue and how should we think about that going forward over the next call it three years or so?
Anne Lloyd: That’s one of the reasons we want to make sure that reiterated that the business is running at capacity. Obviously, we will have increased revenues in profits that will be generated from the new kilns. Since that’s a 20-year take or pay project and those [tonnes] have already been [taken] for, but on the core business you are to a point where you really don’t have additional product to go out and generate more revenues I mean you don’t the product to sell then what will happen on that core business is that you will see that the pricing will be what’s going to drive organic growth and then our ability to continue to control the costs and those costs, steal utilization and natural gas pricing. So those are those things look like they are in pretty good shape but you should not expect us to replicate the gross profit growth that we have seen there organically. 
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay, that’s helpful and then the last thing I was hoping to squeeze in, could you just talk a little bit more about the $3.3 million of restructuring expense in the quarter kind of what it accomplished, how we should think about payback and looking forward what kind of restructuring potential that may be in 2013?
Howard Nye:  Sure, Ted, it primarily was we were just taking at a layer of management. So what we have it’s a flatter organization today than we did prior to that and it’s going to be a one-year payback and so you are going to get that $3 million every year. 
Ted Grace - Susquehanna: Okay and just incrementally, is there anything, you are willing to kind of talk about that it could be on the conference in 2013?
Howard Nye: What I think to the extent that we will have any event to discuss we will talk about in future conference calls.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Please go ahead. 
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: Back to the margins for a second, in the Southeast Group in the quarter sales were up, prices was up but your gross profit was down slightly negative, what was going on there?
Howard Nye: You know its really more Georgia driven right now than anything else, Georgia and Alabama. You have got certain degree of fixed cost there. I think part of what I am happy to say Jack, is we are starting to see some green shoots and some signs of light particularly in North Georgia that we haven't seen for a while, but that has been a corner of our business that has just been tough and has been dark.  But as I look ahead, I guess, I would suggest two things, I am seeing more infrastructure work in Florida right now that I have seen for a while, and I am pretty pleased when I am seeing there and I think everyone should be as well. And again based on some of the volume trends that I am starting to see in North Georgia, I think we feel like it is probably seen the worst of the market, but it was clearly feeling most of that during Q4, Jack.
Anne Lloyd: Yeah, we didn't have to feel under absorption of fixed cost, we do have a little bit of increased freight cost that effected it, as we move that volume and we haven't move the whole lot of volume there, so that hit in the fourth quarter.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: And on ready mix, also I mean, slightly negative and just slightly different from last year on higher sales and I know I've different comparison but just in general on the ready mix business where the slight loss in the quarter, is the issue just we need more sales or is there anything else going on there?
Howard Nye: You know what, its twofold Jack, I mean that's the business, its not a Martin Marietta business, it’s a ready mix business issue across the United States, I don't think anybody is really making money in ready mix right now, I think that is industry that strives to save itself to prosperity, I think we have done a lot to cut cost in that business. I think two things need to happen now. I think it needs to have some volume and I think we are starting to see some volume come through, and the other thing that has to happen is we are going to have to recognize some pricing in that business. Those are the two things that have to happen to make it work, and it’s a business that ought to work. It’s not a business that we want to be in everywhere. It’s a business that we are going to be in, if its in a market that we think is attractive for the long term and that's why we obviously increased our exposure to it in Denver, but again I think it’s a volume and it’s a price situation and I think that's very clear right now.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T:  A little different question, but obviously on this call and some previous calls of yours, there’s been a lot of conversation about the good trends in the middle part of the country. You mentioned industrial renaissance which I think is appropriate, related to energy what's going on in the energy field here, would you guys ever consider an expansion or an acquisition into something like frac sand, I know there are smaller tons there but the margins right now are pretty attractive, is that something that would ever come on the radar.
Anne Lloyd: Jack I hate to ever speculate on what we would or wouldn't do, because obviously we may have a number of things that we might be looking at under confidentiality agreements. But as a practical matter what I will tell you is the businesses that we like are businesses that have high barriers to entry, and being in the crush stone business as oppose to some degree of sand business really brings that there. The other thing that we have been really sensitive to is making sure that we operate with a safety and environmental sensitivity that's important. There are a number of issues around frac sand in particular that I'm mindful of and that we are watching carefully as an industry. So I'm not sure I've answered your question directly, I'm not sure that I can answer your question directly but I'll try to give you a sense of the types of things that move us more than others.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research:  You mentioned (inaudible) to expect a tough comp in the first five months of the year because of favorable weather in 2012. If I recall a year ago you took on some greater than expected costs in the first quarter to meet the increased demand. Just wondering if you could help us think about how you are going to be managing your costs really through 2013 and maybe some of the various cost buckets that you are seeing and in particular the first part of the year should we anticipate perhaps not as aggressive purchasing activity as you did a year ago, just given that it looks like we are having a bit more of a normal winter.
Howard Nye: Actually if you think about it Garik what happened last year’s volume really spiked up pretty considerably in the first quarter, I want to say volumes up 10.7% in Q1, which meant we had to come back a lot earlier. So what we were actually seeing was a little bit of spike in M&R because (inaudible) that we had to come back earlier, we had to come back at some places where we hadn’t been for a while. If you go back to Q4 and look actually one thing that we did that I think made a lot of sense. If you look at what we are doing from the tons produced per working man hour metric, we were operating very, very efficiently during the quarter. We actually built some inventory in the quarter which is going to let us come back in the fiscal year of this year a little bit later, and obviously the more you can get out of those cold winter months before you have to start operating from a cost perspective and an efficiency perspective it’s incredibly helpful. So we did try to take some lessons learned from last year, apply them to Q4 and that's what we have going forward into this first quarter.
Anne Lloyd: And they are for all Garik, I mean if I think about the categories of costs, I mean depreciation should be D&A should be about same as it is this year, really just general wage inflation and general cost inflation across the board. I don't think, balanced for usage and I don't think we've seen anything in our planning process that has such cost spiking up unusually. You know, I'll always caveat that the diesel fuel is a little bit of a wildcard, that even our planning for that, I think should hold pretty well barring any kind of unforeseen consequences out of that.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay, that’s helpful. So the idea really is to come in when volumes spike seasonally and operate much at full capacity as possible.
Howard Nye: That’s correct.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: And then my second question would be just on the pricing guidance, you talked a little bit about potential mid-year opportunities in some of your downstream assets for price increases. Just wondering how much of your pricing guidance on the aggregate side is predicated on media price increases as oppose to when you are seeing in the market for either January or April?
Howard Nye: Garik, the two to four that we are talking about doesn’t have any mid-year in that. That’s just based on what we believe coming out of the box here in ‘13. So to the extent that mid-year, that would just be help.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay, and then just lastly on the volume guidance. You talked about TIFIA being more of a 24 working opportunity at this point. Is there any TIFIA associated volume baked in to the 2013 outlook?
Howard Nye: You know, very little if anything baked in to that at all. We’ve met while we said, we will start seeing awards here as we finish up the first quarter. We might see some activity on TIFIA and have to. The biggest play that we're going to have on that we will see next year and beyond. So, I wouldn't count on a big volume pop (inaudible) on TIFIA but I will tell you that’s a wave and that wave is coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Mike Betts - Jefferies: Just two questions from me if I could Howard and Anne. Firstly thank you for additional information on some of the downstream businesses, that does create one question in my mind, the actual gross margin does look quite high in relation to the aggregates business. Could you may be Howard talk about where you view that in the cycle, sort of a mid-teen margin. Is that at a high level or do you see potential significant upside to that and particularly where was it at the peak when demand was much higher? And then my second question just on the corporate charge, I am looking at the minus 11.1 in the earnings from operations. Apart from the restructuring cost of 3.3 is there any other one-offs in there? Thank you. 
Howard Nye: With respect to the restructuring we had the 3.3, we had the cost relative to information systems and we have talked about the incremental overhead at Denver. Those are the three issues that we fit them right. With respect to what we are seeing on asphalt; look I hear you on the margins they don’t necessarily just knock my socks off and I think we can actually do considerably better with that. The primary thing asphalt needs is the same thing that aggregates needs right now, it needs volume, and again to the extent that we can control to our best ability what happens or doesn’t happen with liquid asphalt, the asphalt business itself particularly in FOB business could be a very attractive business. But keep in mind we have significantly doubled down on our asphalt business with what we have done in Denver; again around 1.7 million tons of asphalt in Denver this year versus what would have been 1.5 million tons in our Heritage business.  So if we are simply looking at that that give you some sense of numbers around that and one other thing is probably would noting is asphalt and Denver is not as expensive as asphalt is in the south west as well. So again if we are coming back and taking to look at market leadership in a place like Denver where we feel like we can do more, the fact is, I think we can see improvement in the asphalt.
Anne Lloyd: And Mike, I would add to that that we are at various times try to take advantage of the physical storage of liquid, if we can get a good price on that, and with liquid price up over 18% last year on average, if we can get just some of our consumption handled on the physical (inaudible) we can have better performance there.
Mike Betts - Jefferies: Okay, just a follow up there, where was the straight margin in that show previously?
Howard Nye: We have had such a modest asphalt component run business like we can go back and get that for you and take it offline, but I am not sure that we have here for you right now.
Anne Lloyd: Yeah, its really had a whole lot of asphalt volume and so probably those peaks wont be reflective of what the future is going to be.
Mike Betts - Jefferies: Okay, no worries, and then the Denver overhead in the corporate charge, how much in millions was that?
Anne Lloyd: I am sorry, Mike, the Denver overhead is not in the corporate charge, it’s in the title SG&A. So that corporate charge is going to be the systems upgrade on severance cost or restructuring cost as well as think there is some incentive compensation cost included in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo: Joey Matthews on for Adam; I had a question on your Ag line business. I wanted to see if you could shed some light on what kind of contribution you got from that this quarter since you mentioned it in the release and your opening remarks, both volume and profitability?
Howard Nye: No, I'm happy to talk really more about the volume than anything else. The Ag line business for us principally is going to be in the Midwest division and part of what we were pleased with last year I want to say and we ended up with around 1.3 million tonnes of Ag line last year, particularly in the Midwest. And I will well you Joey we really thought that was a pretty good year.  So when we came in this year at 400,000 tonnes ahead of that, we were pretty pleased if we look at just what it was in the Midwest in Q4, it was around 953,000 tonnes in the Midwest. So up very nicely year-over-year and the quarter and up nicely year-over-year for full year as well.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo : Great and I had follow-on question related to infrastructure demand. Do you see any difference or recent trends or maybe foreseeable trends with respect to demand for repair work versus new highway construction work and how you think about the balance between those two and the effect on your gross margins and volume?
Howard Nye: What I think there is more of an acute need for new projects right now because that’s simply not been a place that we've been for the last several years and the emphasis because of the way the highway build has worked or candidly has not worked has been more focused on repair work for the last several years because there was not a long-term commitment from the federal government to be there to match the state. So to the extent now the states feel like they literally had a two-year path ahead of them to let some major projects. We think that's what we are more likely to see. Keep in mind, having two years of visibility today means that some place that we as an industry haven't been since 2007, and I think when Ray LaHood came out after MAP-21 was put in, he was pretty clear in saying that there was pent up demand in the new project sector as well.  Again if we go and take a look at some of the different markets and in which we are participating and seeing activity right now, that's clearly what we are seeing in places like Florida, particularly central Florida and up. We are seeing an enormous amount of infrastructure activity in North Texas. Iowa DOT has got a record DOT program this year. So again even as we come back and reflect on what Virginia maybe trying to do with what its just easing through today, I think we feel like the larger projects will likely dominate at least over the next several years. But the nice thing is you always have to have the maintenance and repair.  The only issue relative to the margins the other part of your question that I would again come back and say is to the extent that you are seeing more base stone go out for some period of time on new projects, that does tend to be a product that's priced call it 30% less than a clean stone. So that's simply part of the reality. At the same time being in a position to move that base out is a nice place for us to be.
Operator: And with no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. This year we anticipate building a momentum generated from our 2012 performance and look forward to discussing our first quarter 2013 results with you in May. Thanks for your time today and for your continuing support of our company.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Howard Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.
Howard Nye - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining this Martin Marietta Materials’ quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to discuss our third quarter 2012 results as well as our full year expectations. We’ll also share our preliminary view of the macro indicators for our aggregates product line end use markets in 2013. As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by Securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our third quarter 2012 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the SEC's website. Finally, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings. Third earnings per diluted share of $1.36 exceeded the consensus by $0.10 and represented an improvement of 27% over the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by a 4.1% increase in heritage aggregates product line pricing and the contribution from our acquired operations in the Denver, Colorado market. Additionally, our Specialty Products business posted record third quarter earnings from operations. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased more than 20% primarily attributable to our Denver area businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. In fact, our West Group had $300 million of third quarter net sales with 30% attributable to our Denver acquisitions. We continue to see indications of increasing construction activity in the Denver market, including the rate of growth in highway contract awards and construction related employment, both of which exceed national averages. Quarterly net sales were also positively affected by the continuation of strong pricing trends as evidenced by the average selling price increase in our heritage aggregates product line. Pricing growth was reported in each of our groups led by a 5.1% increase in the Southeast Group aided by favorable product mix. The West Group’s 4.8% price increase was the result of increased shipments to the energy sector. Finally, our Mideast Group reported a 3.5% increase in heritage pricing with growth in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. We see these positive trends in our business despite the current economic uncertainty, which first arose in June of this year and has continued to negatively affect demand. Accordingly, aggregates product line shipments decreased 3.8% in the quarter. Geographically, our Mideast and West Groups experienced shipment declines of 2.6% and 2.3% respectively, while our Southeast Group reported a 10.7% reduction as economic growth in this region still lags national trends. The infrastructure market continues to account for more than half of our business and shipments to this end use sector declined 6% compared with the prior year quarter. The passage of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st Century or MAP-21 ended a 3-year period in which states were hesitant to commit to long-term capital projects due to funding uncertainty. States can now confidently utilize MAP-21 dollars as well as other funding options to support vital infrastructure projects. Although July’s passage of MAP-21 was too late to provide a demand boost in the current construction season, we believe it should provide momentum into 2013. In addition to MAP-21 another positive sign for infrastructure activity is the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act also known as TIFIA. TIFIA applications now exceed $27 billion and span 11 states. Notably, several key Martin Marietta states specifically Texas and North Carolina have now applied for TIFIA funding assistance on identified large multi-year projects. To put this in some context, thus far Texas alone has put forward potential TIFIA projects with investments exceeding $6 billion. A further significance, the timing of these proposed TIFIA projects actually coincides with fiscal year 2013’s more than doubling of Texas’ traditional Department of Transportation spending. Two other key states Iowa and Florida have also initiated strong state level programs to finance major projects. As mentioned earlier while these factors provide some momentum heading into 2013, our full year 2012 infrastructure end use market volumes are expected to be down slightly. The non-residential market, our second largest end use continued to enjoy quarterly growth in energy sector shipments. Our South Texas market has been the primary beneficiary of this energy related activity. Their third quarter volumes were up 49%. In fact South Texas is the only market reporting increased volume in each month of 2012. Other markets have continued to manage their way through erratic month-to-month shipment levels, driven largely by sporadic commercial construction activity. Many developers are simply hesitant to begin new projects given the current economic and political uncertainty. Overall, heritage shipments to the non-residential end use were flat compared with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect 2012 heritage aggregates product line shipments to the non-residential market to increase in the high-single digits. Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the residential end use market grew 14% over the prior year quarter reflecting increased housing starts. For the full year, we expect shipments to this end use market to have a higher rate of growth compared with that of 2011. Although the residential market is recovering, it nonetheless remains depressed compared to historical averages. Still, September’s seasonally adjusted annual housing start rate of 872,000 marked the first time that number had exceeded 800,000 since September of 2008. To complete our end use market discussion ChemRock and Rail experienced a 14% reduction of the heritage aggregates product line shipments. Declining coal traffic and the comparison with an unusually strong 2011 third quarter tied to Midwestern flood repairs were the primary divers of this reduction. For the full year, we expect heritage ChemRock and Rail shipments to decline by high-single digits. For the quarter we’ve reduced heritage aggregates product line production to match shipment levels. As a result heritage aggregates product line direct production cost declined 2.7% compared with the prior year quarter. Reductions in both personnel and repair costs allowed us to hold the increase in heritage aggregates product line costs per ton to 1%. In fact on a per ton basis our third quarter 2012 personnel costs were the lowest in four years. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments of our operating team in managing this critical cost component. Other than personnel, energy is the largest piece of our direct production cost. For the quarter we paid diesel fuel costs averaging $3.08 per gallon compared with an even $3 per gallon in the prior year quarter. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 22.9%. Excluding the effect of acquired businesses, our consolidated gross margin would have been 25.6%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year quarter. Of note, our Mideast Group, which is not affected by vertical integration, leveraged an increase in net sales and cost control to expand its gross margin by 180 basis points. Our Specialty Products business repeatedly makes significant contributions to our quarterly performance. Strong demand for both chemical and dolomitic lime products generated net sales of $49.4 million. From a cost perspective, this business effectively leveraged lower-priced natural gas and generated earnings from operations of $17 million, a third quarter record. This result represents a 350 basis point increase in operating margin over the prior year quarter. I am also pleased to report that the construction of our new dolomitic lime kiln in Woodville, Ohio has been substantially completed on budget, ahead of schedule, and already producing line. The customary debugging process is underway, but we expect this new kiln to generate net sales in the fourth quarter and ongoing anticipate incremental annual net sales of $22 million to $25 million with margins comparable to existing operations. We continue to focus on selling, general and administrative or SG&A costs. For the quarter, SG&A expenses represented 6% of our net sales, a 140 basis point reduction compared with the comparable prior year period. We incurred approximately $1 million in cost during the quarter relating to our planned information systems software upgrade. This initiative has a total budgeted cost of $8 million and is expected to be complete in 2013. We believe our information systems continue to be industry leading and provide us with a great resource to perpetuate our outstanding cost management. Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $91.1 million compared with $80 million in the prior year quarter. For the first nine months of the year, cash provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of business development expenses, was $160 million. Days sales outstanding was 45 days comparable with 2011. Including the $32 million for the new lime kiln, we invested $106 million in various capital initiatives through the third quarter. We also maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At September 30, 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.58 times compliant with the limits under our debt covenant. We recently amended this covenant to provide incremental liquidity cushion. As amended, the debt covenant limit remains at 3.75 times through June 30, 2013. The limit will then return to 3.5 times beginning September 30, 2013. For the full year 2012, we expect heritage aggregates product line volume to increase 1% to 2%, pricing to increase 2% to 4%, and direct production cost per ton to increase slightly. SG&A expenses, exclusive of the incremental expense for our Denver operations and costs related for our information systems upgrade, are expected to decline slightly compared with 2011. Earnings for our Specialty Products segment are expected to range from $68 million to $70 million. We expect interest expense to be approximately $5 million less than in 2011. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% inclusive of discrete events and capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million. To conclude, we are encouraged by our future prospects and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on increased construction activity, as funding stability returns. Looking ahead to 2013, we have started to frame our preliminary view of the macro indicators affecting our end use markets. Our preliminary view assumes the U.S. Congress will resolve budget issues and additional or automatic budget cuts through the sequestration process will not occur. Given that assumption, we expect the infrastructure end use market to increase in the mid-single digits driven by the impact of MAP-21, TIFIA and states sponsored programs. Alone TIFIA’s potential $50 billion impact exceeds the total stimulus dollars awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We anticipate our non-residential end use market to increase in the high-single digits. We believe the residential end use market will experience double-digit volume growth. Finally, we expect our ChemRock and Rail end use market will be flat compared with 2012. We remain confident that our disciplined operating approach will deliver results enhancing long-term shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions. We’ll be happy to address your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Hi. Good afternoon Ward and good afternoon Anne. Can you comment on the factors that are driving the margin improvement in your heritage aggregate operation and how we should think about it or your expectations for that on a go forward basis?
Howard Nye: And Arnie really there are three drivers that are doing that right now. If you take a look at it it’s going to be pricing which was actually nicely up for the quarter. Again pretty close to the 4% up despite volumes that are down almost that same percentage. I’m really pleased with what we’ve done on cost control. Arnie, if we take a look at the costs that we have if I would look at labor, energy, M&R go through the entire list the only place that I saw anything that was negative was really in supplies and that was largely driven by energy in other words rubber, conveyer belt and tires, etcetera. So, as I look at pricing it’s in the right direction as I look at cost control we talked about I think this was the lowest cost per ton on personnel we had seen in four years and what all that adds up to is what we see in productivity. If I’m looking at our tons produced per working man hour and that’s the primary productivity metric that we’ll use. That was up over 4% for the quarter so I think what I would tell you is our teams are watching the business from a very fundamental perspective and they are executing well and I think that execution as well as pricing is what’s driving that up margin expansion that you’re seeing.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: And you spoke to volume improvement for next year if that word will occur what’s your view of that could impact your margin on a go forward basis?
Howard Nye: Arnie that’s the beauty we’re seeing right now when you can see what price is doing to this cost basis right now. Yeah I think if we end up putting any degree of volume to this business I think what you can see is its going drop to the bottom line in very significant percentages and that’s how we get to the incremental margins that we discussed. Again volume coming back and volume coming back across the enterprise is what’s important to that. But I think if the macro indicators that we’ve talked about are right it’s going to be one of those few times I think in a career when we can say we’re seeing infrastructure res and non-res all moving up at the same time and it’s hard as it is that hasn’t happened that often and next year might be one of those years.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: And you spoke very specifically about the demand in Denver market could you speak to integration and what you’ve called the modernizing opportunities see in Denver and where are we in the process?
Howard Nye: We are working our way through the process. We feel like as we’ve come into 2013 we’ll really have that process where we want to see it. Obviously that’s a significant transaction for us. It’s a vertically integrated marketplace in which we’re operating there. So we feel that we’re entirely where we thought we would be with respect to integration. The business is performing frankly ahead of our expectations and separate and apart from what we’re doing internally to the business I’d like what I see in Denver. Before sitting here looking at that market I am looking at a 32% increase in highway demand there. We are watching commercial markets all of which are improving office, industrial and the retail sectors all have declining vacancy rates. Wage and salary growth in Denver is somewhere between 4.5% and 5% that’s clearly better than the U.S. And you heard me speak in my prepared remarks to housing generally, but we’re seeing single-family housing permits up in Denver 25%, we’re seeing multi-family up there 40%. And we are seeing an increasingly high ability to participate in the Niobrara activity in that market as well. So, do we have some internal work to finish Martinizing the business? Absolutely. Will we be done by year end? We believe so. Is the business performing better than we thought? Yes. And do we like the way the markets behaving? The answer to that is yes as well.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Arnie thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. You discussed a little bit in your prepared comments in the press release about your Texas outlook, but I was hoping if you go into perhaps a little bit more detail as related to your outlook for next year in terms of the overall budget and parsing out how much of the incremental upside is driven by TIFIA funding for infrastructure projects versus core budget or other bonding related projects?
Howard Nye: Kathryn, what I’ll do, I’ll speak to at least what we are seeing as far as spending is concerned in Texas. For next year, obviously, we’ll give you much more detail on what we think will happen in that market when we come into 2013 and talk to you again in February. But what’s nice about Texas right now, Kathryn is I think the biggest issue TXDOT has is really can they get out and spend all the money that they are talking about spending there this year. I mean the types of the numbers that we are seeing are in excess of $7 billion, and on occasion in excess of $8 billion. What I am encouraged by is probably several things. If you are looking at San Antonio right now, construction employment is up 7% in San Antonio, much of it’s energy driven and we think we are in a good place there for that. Multifamily is at – is near historic highs. Here is the factoid for you, between January and June, 9400 homes were sold in San Antonio, that’s 500 more than they were in the prior year. And part of what we are seeing now is just a lot of subdivision work as well. That’s clearly different. Even when we move from San Antonio to Huston, the best way to describe Houston is, Houston right now just looks back. I mean, it’s at levels that are clearly pre-recession. Housing is tight in Houston though that’s not a word you would use in much of the Southeast, but we are using in Southwest. Inventory and the housing there is around 4.9 months, that’s the lowest since April 2002. And August year-on-year sales were up 20%, that’s the fifteenth straight month of improvement there. The only market that we are not seeing dramatic improvement in that respect is what we are seeing in North Texas right now, Kathryn, but even when we move to North Texas and keep in mind, they are not getting the energy tailwind that South Texas has. What we are seeing in North Texas from an infrastructure perspective is still pretty considerable. I mean, the DFW Connector is still underway, Interstate 635, which is the LBJ is underway, we’ll go into not just next year, but at least through 2015. And we have got a number of jobs on the Southwest Parkway, which is really closer to Tarrant County and another series of jobs there as well. Keep in mind, even these numbers though that we are talking about in TXDOT that are $7 billion, $8 billion, that doesn’t necessarily include the comprehensive development agreements in North Texas. So, I am trying to give you at least some factoids that you can look at Kathryn in building your model going forward. But as we are sitting here looking at what we think our 2013 DOT letting schedule could be in Texas, we are seeing a positive by around 130%.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe moving a little bit over to pricing and you gave some segmentations, in particular, the Southeast benefited from mix versus price increases, but on aggregate as a total, if you were to look just in rough percentages how much was the increased mix versus natural pricing increases in the market?
Howard Nye: Even the Southeast, the mix effect was only about 40 bps. So, it wasn’t that profound. If we looked at it all-in, it was probably around 30 bps. So, what I would tell you is most of it is just genuine pricing, so it’s not so much of mix effect.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: And speaking of pricing shipping over to your Denver market, Denver pricing as you’ve talked about it has been lower versus your legacy products, and Martin’s been making a concerted effort to push pricing out west. How are these efforts progressing? Is the market receptive in light of improved volumes to higher pricing? Any color you might give just on broadly speaking, not just specific pricing in the quarter in Denver, but higher efforts really play out as we look forward over the next 12 to 24 months?
Howard Nye: Right. Kathryn, if we are looking in an average selling price across the company of around 10.57, Denver is considerably lower than that. So, the fact is at least from where I said, yeah, there is considerably room there for that. And actually what I’ll tell you is we have already put our pricing increases in that market, in aggregates, but we are also looking at price increases in ready-mix and across our products. And so far particularly with respect to what we are seeing in ready-mix, we think the biggest piece of price increases that we are putting out there will be sticking. And again I think if we go back to some of the data that I was sharing with Arnie in his first call is volume continues to comeback to that market. I think we will likely see pricing even grow in a more robust way.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Do you think you will be able to be successful on changing the overall philosophy on pricing in that market, because it was a bit different than other markets that could you currently compete?
Howard Nye: The only thing that we can do is we can control what we do. I mean, we can look at our business and try to make the independent decisions that we think are the right decisions to make in that market and others. The thing that I like about Denver and what we have talked with you and others about is we want to be in markets where we can have a number one or number two position. And we think that does give us the ability to be a leader in that market and that’s what we intend to do.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: And final question, what gives you the greatest concern about your preliminary guidance for next year and what gives you – what gives you confidence that those concerns maybe ill founded? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Kathryn, as I look at res, I feel pretty confident with that as I look at non-res on the heavy side uncomfortable with that. That’s been so energy driven. As we look at that, that looks good and solid to me. It certainly seems to me that we should see the lighter side of non-res get some life. I think that’s probably the space if you wanted to put some degree of risk out there that may have the highest degree of risk. But keep in mind by the time we get into next year, we will have had just about a year and a half pretty good housing numbers, and by then, you should start to see the office and retail portion pickup just a bit and go forward. Again, what we are talking that relative to ChemRock and Rail for next year is something that feels much more like up 3- to 5-year average. So, I feel relatively comfortable there and I hope that’s responsive to your question.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: That is. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities:  Hi, thank you. I just wanted to go back to Denver for a little bit, I was trying to understand though the full impact of that operation on the other companies’ overall profile. And so can – and I understand the mix, but can you talk about what the contribution margin would be in the West segment going forward you think? And then you mentioned if there was going back to the question about Martinizing it, if there was any negative impact this quarter you think that you will be able to a quarter or two from now that would have been reversed as its fully Martinized so to speak?
Howard Nye: Well, let me give you some numbers, Adam. And I think this probably will lead you to what you are looking at in large part. There is $90 million in revenue in Denver. The best way to think about that is around half of that $90 million is going to be in some downstream form of business so either hot mix or ready-mix. And again from a hot mix perspective, when we bought that business in Denver we’ve just about doubled our hot mix exposure. I want to say heritage business, usually around 1.3 million tons these last few years we’ve picked up around 1.5 million tons in Denver. If you go back and look at our heritage business on ready-mix, usually that’s going be somewhere between over the last several years 0.5 million cubic yards and 600,000 cubic yards, we are going be somewhere just north probably of 800,000 cubic yards in Denver in ready-mix. So, from that perspective, it is a different look there. I do think as we move forward with the balance of the integration, you will make a nice difference there. Keep in mind what we said was we have planned for the acquisition in Denver to be accretive in 2013. And that is still our plan to have that business accretive in 2013.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, thank you. And then just secondly, I think it’s been while since I have publicly heard anything, is there been any update you care to share with any plans to proceed or not proceed with Vulcan?
Howard Nye: Yeah, you are right it’s been very quiet on that. And what I’ll tell you is obviously we are focused on running our business and we are focused on creating shareholder value. And that’s creating shareholder value through doing what we do organically and otherwise, that’s what we are going to look at. And if we can create shareholder value by looking at acquisitions, we are going to look at acquisitions. So, for us, I think what our track record is, I think we look for continuous improvement and we look to grow our business in any number of ways. So, I know that’s a relatively vague answer, but that’s probably the best that I can do for you this time.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee:  Hi, thanks very much. Good afternoon guys.
Howard Nye: Hi, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Big picture and then small picture, let’s have big picture first, as you look at your outlook for 2013, I mean obviously that’s a key item that everybody is focused on. You’ve had a few questions about it. But can you talk a little bit about how you formulated that and where you are sort of – where you are looking at an order book, your level or your customers’ level and where it’s a little more sort of nebulous?
Howard Nye: Well, Todd, again, big picture I think that’s really the way that we are looking at that right now is from a big picture. And again, we’ll probably give you much more detail that you can really sink your teeth into coming February. But again if we are looking at sitting in a place with a highway build that we haven’t done for years. I mean, Todd you’ve heard me say we are now sitting in a spot from a forward-looking view perspective, we haven’t been since 2007. And that as we’ve at least got two years of knowing what we have had ahead of us. I think knowing that there is something that’s solid with MAP-21 that states and others can count on we think is significant. Seeing what’s coming in TIFIA, we also think is pretty significant. Again, if you take a look at what’s going on relative to TIFIA in some of the markets that are moment to us, it’s a pretty big deal. I mean, we have looked at 16, 17, almost 19 different projects that are out there. If you look at $27 billion worth of projects that had been bid so far, I said five of them in Texas, two in North Carolina, and that puts us in a spot that we feel like we can be more than competitive on more than $9 billion worth of that work. If we look at some of the jobs that were out there in previous TIFIA submissions, but have not yet been resubmitted being some of those were in North Carolina, and specifically, the Garden Parkway near Charlotte, if we look at Texas, San Antonio Loop 1604 and State Highway 550 and the Valley are all jobs that we will be looking at in Florida I-75. So, again, if we are looking big picture and you are looking MAP-21 and you are looking at TIFIA, yeah I think those are pretty considerable. I can go through the rest of the buckets. And you assume that shale has been awfully good work for us this year in the energy sector. I’ll let you draw your own conclusions on where do you see energy going, but clearly if you’ve got infrastructure that’s moving where we think it is, if you’ve got energy that you think maybe pretty solid next year, if you’ve got another good year of housing, yeah, I think those are the building blocks that leads you to at least some of the macro indicators that we’ve put out there, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Great. Thanks for that color. Drilling down a little bit on the Denver market, you talked some about the downstream businesses, how are those businesses and again the non-aggregates, the paving and the asphalt and the ready-mix, how are those operating relative to what you would have expected? How is the demand, I assume the demand has come along pretty good based on some of your other comments, but how is that going in? And what does the profitability look like for those businesses, which ones you are making money and which ones are tougher?
Howard Nye: I mean, clearly downstream businesses tend to be tougher businesses in this type of market area. I think if you want to come back and say which ones look tougher and which ones look better, I think it’s not a Denver issue, I think it’s probably a U.S. issue to come back and say ready-mix is a tougher animal than anything else is today. At the same time, what I will tell you is what we are seeing relative to activity in that market is I see better than we thought it would be, Todd. Ready-mix was going to be driven disproportionately when things start building up. So when we start seeing that form of vertical construction that we are seeing now in Denver, that’s a good sign. At the same time, the hot mix business in some markets has been pretty good this year, in other markets it struggled more. What I’ll tell you is we’re seeing a lot of project work in Denver. Through September we bid on 1,700 projects in that market I mean that’s a lot. And we’ve got a success rate on those projects that I won’t give you that I do know but I won’t give it to you. But I’m pretty excited about the type of success right we have on those keeping in mind we want to have a leadership position, so we’re bidding those projects very carefully and we’re trying to be responsive in that market.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Right, good you’re just teasing me on the success rate, by the way.
Howard Nye: Well.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Final question, thinking about the seasonality we haven’t been through the full fourth quarter with these guys yet, any color on that I think about that I mean think about maybe if we compare to the first quarter, how should we think about the downstream activity there relative to what was on the first quarter?
Howard Nye: Well, that’s a great question. And Todd, what I’ll always tell you is the first quarter out there is always going be tough. I mean its January, February and March and what happens at the end of March is you’re going to make or break that. Usually in most these places, October is going be pretty good month. I mean across the industry, October is usually the single biggest month that the industry sees. It’s usually not horribly cold and it’s usually relatively dry. So, I’ll send you to the NOAA forecast to see what it looked like in the neighborhood near you. But I think if you look at what October is and you assume that in any of these cold markets, if you can have a good solid run up to Thanksgiving really that’s doing pretty well. And anything you get after Thanksgiving it’s almost gravy, so that’s probably the best way to think about it.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: I’ll got take a look at the NOAA forecast, but given that’s it’s now November any color on whether we might have had a good solid run so far as we approach Thanksgiving?
Howard Nye: Well, I’ll tell you what Todd I’ll say you all about that in February.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Alright. Thanks a lot Ward.
Howard Nye: Alright. Todd, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Your line is open.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.
Howard Nye: How are you doing Jack?
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Doing fine. Thanks Ward. My first question is the volumes were down in Q3, I guess that led to bit of a reduction in volume guidance for the year. Sitting here today do we think that the really mild first quarter accelerated shipments and there just wasn’t enough left in backlog for 2012 to maintain guidance?
Howard Nye: I think it did a number of things. So, I think the early start it probably rob a little bit from the back end of the year. I think that’s there. I think the protracted process of MAP-21 and the uncertainty that came from that did a bit of a number on it as well. It’s funny if you look at the first five months of the year Jack it was up 10%. If you look at June through September it was down 4%, I think there was a confidence issue somewhere in there as well. I think you had several things, I think you did have an early start to the year, but I do think the MAP-21 process and things relative around confidence was pretty tough. The other thing that I’m sensitive to as I sit here as we head into the end of the year too is when I’m talking with your at some point next year we’re going have to dealing with what was pretty a tough comparable back in Q1. So, I’m sitting here right now thinking it probably did do a little bit of harm to us in the later part of the year and then you and I will probably have another conversation along that line as we talk about Q1 next year.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Sure, that’s good heads up for model building. On the subject of infrastructure if we go back in time and big highway always builds happen like 221 and people got excited and obviously the stimulus program which was a shot in your arm to infrastructure thought to be big a increment at the time probably not such a big increment and now we’re looking at not just this MAP-21 program, but the TIFITA program which seems have generated some excitement, what’s the chances that it’s a bit of a disappointment and that there are offsets like we’ve seen in the past and is there a chance that the money spend on larger projects and maybe less aggregates intensive?
Howard Nye: The only time I think you’ll see money spent on larger projects will be less aggregate intensive is if you have a lot of bridge work. If there is a lot of bridge work it’s going have a lot of concrete, it’s going have cement. But it’s not going have a lot of aggregates. I think what we’re seeing and where we have certainly sense most of the pent up demand and what we’re seeing in most TIFIA projects is adding some form of lane capacity. And I think when we come back and add lane capacity. That’s going to be awfully important to us look. As I look at the big jobs that are out there right now that we are seeing in TIFIA. What I am seeing I-77 HOT lanes in Charlotte. I am seeing I-83 or State Highway 183 in Dallas. I am seeing State Highway 288 in Houston, 183 in Austin, again the Grand Parkway in Houston, Interstate 35 in Dallas. All of these are big lane addition projects. So, I think as we sit here and look at it, I think TIFIA from where I sit, Jack, I think it’s going to be the real deal. And I think the other difference that we have relative to the underlying program is we have two years of knowing that we have something. I mean if we go back and look at the stimulus deal or others, you still had an environment which you are operating that didn’t have any degree of consistency or forward view to it. Now, am I crazy about a 2-year forward view? Not as crazy as that would be about a 6-year forward view, but believe me it feels a lot better than 60 days.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Sure. Certainly, part of their general uncertainty you were referring to. Okay, that’s great. Thanks a lot, Howard.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Jack.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Hi, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Howard, excellent pricing in the quarter, can you just talk about what surprise to the upside and presumably realizations were somewhat higher than you expected. Can you just give us some color?
Howard Nye: Yeah. I am not sure that they were all that higher really than expected. I mean, it was kind of right, and it was toward the upper end of the range that we thought it would be. As I said, it probably got a little bit of help candidly not an enormous amount of help from at least from the geography that was going on in South Texas going to the rail yards. And I mentioned around the 40 bps that helped a bit in the Southeast, but Jerry as I look here across our different areas of business what I am seeing is a lot of green. And part of what helped here too is we saw some pricing in Carolina. And you and I have talked about the fact that, that’s a market that’s awfully important to us. And when we are seeing pricing in South Texas and when we are seeing pricing in a place like Charlotte, it really helps and drops to the bottom line pretty quickly.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And I know seasonality can skew things in the fourth quarter, but you still have a pretty wide guidance range for pricing, I am wondering how you expect pricing on a year-over-year basis back up in the fourth quarter compared to what we just saw for the third?
Howard Nye: You know what I’ll tell you more about that when we come in for the full year, but obviously given what our range is Jerry you’ve got a pretty view for where that is. There is not much math left to the year.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Sure. And so you think about 2013 presumably you are having the Jan 1 price increase announcements with your customers give, if you’ve sent that, any notices, can you just share with us on what you are targeting well for January 1?
Howard Nye: You know what, Jerry obviously, the prices that will go out are going to vary enormously by market. And what we may see in a market in one part of Texas or another part of Texas could swing dramatically. The same story could be in North Carolina. So, it’s hard to come back and put any specifics to it, but obviously we are in the process of really finalizing a lot of that right now.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And lastly now that you’ve had a couple of quarters with the Denver assets under your belt, can you just talk about how you expect the margin progression to compare versus the rest of the business over the next call it one to two years, if your volume forecast play out how do you expect margin expansion in the Denver assets to compare with the rest of the aggregates footprint?
Howard Nye: Sure, Jerry. I mean, clearly, we are going to have to look at that market on an integrated basis, because that’s the way that market is built. And because it’s built on more of an integrated basis, it’s not going to have the same type of margin number at the end of the day that we have come to expect in a more pure-play market. From that perspective, will it lag other markets? I think that’s entirely fair to say, because again you can’t have that much hot mix and ready-mix and have that happened. At the same time, if we look at Denver and look at the currency that we used in River, what I’ll tell you is Denver at peak was about 3x where River was in peak. And it all comes back to our notion that we are looking to be one or two in markets that we think have near-term and long-term attractive demographics to it and Denver falls entirely into that. And Denver is the market that when volume returns to that market will be very attractive to this economy.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms – Stephens:
 :
Howard Nye: Great.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: On ‘13, as we kind of look out there, historically you’ve said and I think you’ve touched on this again today that you would need to see kind of an improvement across the enterprise I guess kind of from geographic standpoint in order to see the kind of incremental margins you’ve outlined for the business, but kind of looking into next year given your outlook would you expect some of these markets that seem to still be trying to kind of find bottom here would you expect to see them finally start to see demand improvement as well?
Howard Nye: Alight and again, just to be clear we’re really just talking about the pure aggregates business. And Trey the markets that have suffered the most had clearly been the markets in the Southeast United States. And again we’ll come back and talk with some degree of specificity around all of those. I think there are couple of things that are probably we’re thinking about because if you really go back look at them some of the states in the Southeast are getting better. I mean from a housing perspective foreclosures in North Carolina have improved pretty considerably year-over-year. If you look at Georgia last year in August of ’11 the percent of homes with mortgages somewhere in the foreclosure process was almost 3%, today it’s around 2%. So, things are getting better in the Southeast. They are not great, but they are getting better. Here is what I would tell you though. There is the Southeast and then there is Florida. I mean Florida from a housing perspective is so much worse off than anybody else is. The percent of homes with mortgages and foreclosure in Florida last year in August was 12.1%. Its still today at almost 11% and to give you a sense of it when you go from Florida to whoever is next worst, in that case you come to New Jersey and New Jersey is at around 6.5%. So, there is still some tough slogging that people have to do in certain parts of the country. And if we’re sitting here today, you still got one out of every 318 homes in Florida that are in some degree of foreclosure. And to give you a sense, Georgia is down to one in 532, the U.S. rate is one out of every 730. So, there are some parts of our footprint that I think you and I would look at and say these are good markets, these are markets where you want to be, but they are some markets that still have some curing that they need go through. What’s remarkable though and you know its right it only takes a little bit of volume just minimal volume to suddenly start getting very strong incremental returns. So and we joked about in the past and literally said there is nothing wrong with this business that 5 million tons doesn’t cure. And the odd thing is if you and I were talking about 5 million tons back in 2006 it wouldn’t have seemed like that much, today it seems like an enormous amount. But I hope that puts some metrics around what we’re seeing in parts of our business particularly in the Southeast because really that’s where it needs to get well. So, you can see the volume across the enterprise to really propel us to those incremental margins that we will see.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: It’s helpful. Well thanks and I guess one other question again kind of on the outlook. You just given kind of the scenario that you’ve kind of laid out for us would you expect to see any kind of product mix impact to pricing next year just given if things shake out kind of the direction that’s you’ve been laid for us there?
Howard Nye: Right, I guess I would say a couple of things in that respect. Number one, remember Denver is going come in and it won’t be acquisition next year, it’s going to be heritage. So, when Denver pricing comes in that geographic mix is going to pull it down. The other thing that I would tell you is, let’s face it. The big thing that’s going on right now is housing, I mean so if we’re looking at housing numbers August to August up 28% and that’s a great number, but we’re going to be a lagger going into that housing market as well, so we’re not going to feel some of the pop from that. If we are seeing too though more of these TIFIA projects and I believe that we will. And if these TIFIA projects are building more new lane miles we’re going to send more base out. And sending more base out is something that we as an organization will obviously celebrate because it’s going to be more volume and we’re producing base as we’re producing a clean wash stone. But I think bringing Denver into heritage and seeing more base go out if you’re having more new projects will give you at least somewhat of a mix effect that could optically book downward when downward is really not what you’re seeing, I think on the same-quarry, same store, same product basis you won’t see bad things happen. And I think that really is incumbent on us to make sure that we’re explaining it very carefully. And as you recall that was the process that we had to go through couple of years ago as well.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Thanks a lot, Ward. Very helpful, good luck.
Howard Nye: Take care, Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Just a follow-up to Trey’s previous question, you already mentioned that there could be some negative mix issues on pricing next year if you start shipping more base. But I was just wondering on the offset there presumably you’re still working through some maybe a modest backlog of stimulus projects that when they come off perhaps could provide a positive mix effect. I was wondering if you can speak to that maybe provide some color on how many – what percentage of projects in your backlog are still are stimulus related?
Howard Nye: Garik, there is not going to be an enormous amount of stimulus work left particularly when we get to the end of the year. If you go back and look at that $26 billion-$27 billion, 21% of that work was done in 2009, around 43% in ’10, around 22% last year. So, as we came into the year it’s around $1.7 billion that was even left as we came into the year. So, I think it’s a practical matter. You’re not going to see much of an effect from that rolling off in our candor. I think the bigger issue on the mix will be how much is going on in the East versus how much is going on to the West and then how much is going on relative to brand new lane construction projects versus overlay.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay and I guess one more question on that with stimulus we did see an incrementally more competitive pricing environment, mix aside, you’re still operating it fairly low utilization rates as is the industry relative to normal levels, is there any risk in your view that with some of these new big attractive projects coming on that the pricing environment could get incrementally more competitive as competitors chase additional volume?
Howard Nye: What I don’t see Garik today is the sheer level of fear that I think was present in the minds of contractors and frankly others across the economy period that during the period of time that stimulus was really going. So, I see something in the economy today and then the space that is much more steady than it’s been and my sense is that’s not going to be a particularly big issue. The other thing that strikes me on much of these larger jobs, keep in mind these are going to be bid differently, you’re going to start to see a bit of change in the way highway contracting works, because these large design build jobs usually are going to be built by a consortium of contractors who are coming forward to and relationships are going to matter here a lot. And a contractor recognizing on a job that may have an enormous liquidated damages if they don’t turn it on time that they have a producer who can really put the material on the ground is going to be important. So, I’ve seen an entirely different paradigm going into a TIFIA like world as opposed to what I saw going into a stimulus like world.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks. That’s helpful and my last question is on the energy portion of your non-res business you’ve seen good growth here in 2012 you’ve provided an optimistic outlook going forward with declining rig counts, just wondering where your optimism is coming from and is it really coming from continued growth in Eagle Ford are you looking to expand your energy exposure just a little bit of color there will be helpful?
Howard Nye: Absolutely, we – Garik you’re right I mean the drop I’ve seen in rig counts the change from ‘12 is around 9%. But at the same time if I go back and look at the different shale plays in which we are involved, what we’ve seen from a ‘11 to ‘12 in Niobrara is improvement, what we’ve seen from a ‘11 to ‘12 in Barnett relatively stable. What we’ve seen from a ‘11 to ‘12 in Eagle Ford is improvement, what we’ve seen from ‘11 to ‘12 in Haynesville is actually down and what we’ve seen in Marcellus is actually up. So, as we sit here and look at shale activity today I think we see a number that’s nicely up over the last year. And I guess what I would suggest to you is if you look at the ones that are most impactful to us would in today’s world be Niobrara and it would be Eagleford, and to a certain degree, what’s going on in Haynesville and a growing role in Marcellus. I think those look pretty good going into the year. Remember the areas that you are going to see most of the growth can be the areas that you are getting gas and you are getting oil at the same time. And based on what we are seeing in particular in South Texas, we feel like that’s going to be stable, and candidly, we are looking at ways to get into others this time as well.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, thanks so much.
Howard Nye: Sure, Garik.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna:  Hi, guys. How are you doing?
Howard Nye: Hi, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I was hoping to come back to couple of the margin questions. Just to better understand in the core aggregates business, what was happening? And maybe as a starting point, I apologize if I missed it. I think Arnie’s first question asked about some of the comments on your heritage profitability. Could you just reiterate what those were?
Howard Nye: I mean, what I addressed with Arnie on what some of the drivers were. I mean, clearly you had pricing that was helping in that respect. You had cost control that it actually taking cost up candidly a little bit less than 1% for the quarter, which we are pretty pleased with. And we were seeing tons produced per working man hour, up somewhere north of 4% for the quarter as well. So, those were the primary drivers Ted that I gone through with Arnie.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: And so did you speak to what the common heritage incrementals look like?
Howard Nye: Not, I don’t think we spoke specifically to what those numbers look like, but I can tell you that there was growth in the heritage margin.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. Because I guess when I go through the numbers, obviously you had volumes down a little bit and pricing will be tailwind, but you say that on a reported basis, you have a 6% incremental, which included $7 million of better pricing. So, in that note, profits were down about $1 million on an $88 million increase on profitability. I think this gives us some of the questions around to the impact that Denver, the downstream assets maybe very specifically that the paving business. But could you just help us understand you maybe bridge what happened to the underlying profitability of the business, because when we look at the reported numbers, the incremental pull-through probably was below people’s expectations?
Howard Nye: I think if you look at the pricing strength, there was probably around $14 million of pricing strength that was there. If you look at the volume weakness, there was probably almost a similar number on the volume weakness as there was in the pricing. If you look at the decrease in production costs, that’s probably going to get you somewhere north of $6 million. Yeah, I think if we go through and simply take a look at what the acquired locations were and otherwise, I can certainly take you through that bridge in some more detail, if you need to on later call, but I think that in large part is what’s going to gets you there, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, that’s very helpful. But in terms of just understanding the profitability of the downstream businesses, could you speak directly to what those profits or losses look like for the asphalt, for the concrete, and for the paving business?
Howard Nye: We have not done that specifically Ted and obviously we’ll come back and talk about some of that at year end, but as we said earlier on, an asphalt business in many respects is the very profitable or at least a good business in today’s market. Our ready-mix concrete business is going to be a challenged market in any market in the United States today. So, you can certainly take that comment to be what you like it to be or wanted to be with respect to Denver or portions of Texas or Arkansas, and those are the three areas of which we would have ready-mix operations.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. And the last thing I was just hoping to ask is your framework for 2013 was very helpful, but maybe even taking a step back and thinking let’s just say over the next cycle. How would you just frame? How you think about the cycle-over-cycle potential? If we were to try to look back at prior up-cycle, do you think it will be fair to look for similar intensity of growth would be moderated by some of the leverage issues we are facing in the nation, but just any commentary there would be super helpful?
Howard Nye: I don’t think anything is going to be dramatic from a growth perspective, but here is what’s different. I don’t think it has to be dramatic for to be dramatic to our business. I think where we are sitting with today’s cost and with what we think tomorrow’s pricing can be any degree of volume to this business today is incredibly powerful. As you and I discussed in the past, we are 80 million tons away from where we were at peak, and remarkably, if we recover half of that, we go past what our peak profitability was. And I think it’s those types of metrics that tell you that we think it’s going to be a very uneven at times March out of this. Yeah we do. Do we feel like that we’ve seen the worst of it? Yeah, I think we do. Do we feel like any degree of volume is going to be powerful and very quickly drop to our bottom line? Certainly. And we feel like if we have growth across our geography are we going to find the incremental margins that we talked about, I think our confidence on that simply increases.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Yeah was that volume leverage I was trying to get that, so it’s very helpful guys. Coagulations, good luck this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks a lot Ted.
Operator: Thank you. I am showing no questions in the queue at this time. I will hand the call back Mr. Nye for closing remarks.
Howard Nye - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks again for joining our third quarter 2012 call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. As we said we are encouraged by recent positive trends which should lead to increased construction activity in 2013 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results with you in February. Thanks for your time today and for your continued support to Martin Marietta. Good day to all of you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Quarter 2012 Conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to host Mr. Ward Nye. You may begin.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer. We're pleased to share our second quarter 2012 results, and our expectations for the full year. Before we begin, let me remind you that this is discussion may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements in this discussion are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Except that's required by applicable law, Martin Marietta takes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release, relating to our second quarter, 2012 results, and to Martin Marietta's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on the SEC's website. Finally, any references in our discussion to margin are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. This is also explained in our SEC filings.  For the second consecutive quarter, our Heritage Aggregates business has reported an increase in operating margin, expanding 150 basis points in the second quarter 2012. This expansion was driven by our Heritage Aggregates product line, which reported a 2.8% increase in shipments; and a 2.4% increase in pricing. Underscoring this performance, are signs of recovery in certain of our markets, predominately in the western United States. These trends, along with the recent passage of a multi-year federal highway bill, and regionalised improvement in home building, have provided optimism for future construction activities. We also continue to be pleased with our specialty products business, which established a new second quarter record for net sales, and once again, generated impressive margins. The volume momentum generated in the first quarter, for our Heritage Aggregated product line shipments, continued into April and May. In fact, Heritage shipments for the two month period ended May 31, increased 8% over the comparable prior year period. In that volume environment, we generated an incremental gross margin consistent with our expectations. Predictably, in markets with more notable volume growth, we generated an incremental gross margin much higher than 60%. As an example, our Des Moines, Iowa district experienced a 16% shipment increase for this two month period; and generated an incremental gross margin of 75%. However, in June, certain project delays and economic uncertainty led to a 5 1/2% decline, in Heritage shipments compared with June 2011. This erratic volume pattern, together with planned inventory control measures; diluted the incremental gross margin gains, that were achieved in the first two months of the quarter. We see consistent indications of recovery in our West group, which reported a 7.6% volume increase for the quarter. Shipments were notably strong in Texas, and Iowa. The Texas market experienced robust construction activity, including increased shipments to both the energy spectrum, as well as the residential end use markets.  Our mid-west division, particularly Iowa, benefited from mild winter weather, which facilitated to an earlier start to the construction season, and allowed for significant progress on several projects. Including the expansion of Highway 20, also known as the Midwest Connector, in western Iowa. Heritage Aggregates volume in our mid-east group increased nearly 8% for the two month period ended May 2012, as compared to the prior year; driven by strength in our Indiana and Ohio markets for major highway projects. However, June volumes declined over 4%. Primarily as a result of project delays in North Carolina, which are expected to defer certain shipments to the second half of the year. Overall, our mid-east group reported a 2.9% increase in Heritage Aggregates product line shipments for the quarter. Our south-east group experienced a 10% decline in Heritage Aggregate product line shipments, due to economic conditions, lagging national trends, which is largely attributable to weak job growth and continued high foreclosure rates. We're pleased that three out of four of our end-use markets reported Heritage Aggregates product-line volume growth. Shipments to our Heritage infrastructure market increased 3% over the prior quarter. This end use, which accounts for more than half of our aggregates product line shipments, should benefit in the future from the recent passage of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st century act, or MAP 21; which is signed into law earlier this month.  MAP 21 is essentially a final three month continuing resolution to the previous highway bill, through September 30; followed by an abbreviated two year highway program. We believe the new law, which provides highway expenditures of $40 billion annually, will create a higher degree of fiscal certainty for states, counties, and municipalities; compared with a series of shorter-term continuing resolution in effect, since 2009. Furthermore, MAP 21 provides for expedited project approvals, eliminates ear marks and embraces more private sector involvement, all of which we believe will be positive for our business. Aggregates product-line shipments to our residential end-use market, increased 8% in the prior year quarter. This growth is due to a 40% increase in shipments to the energy sector, which are primarily reflected in our west group results. Our Heritage residential end-use market continued its recovery from depressed levels, has experienced a 21% increase in aggregates product line shipments over the prior year quarter. This growth reflects the increase in National year-to-date housing starts, and was noteworthy in our Charlotte, Kansas City and San Antonio markets.  Finally, aggregates product line shipments to our heritage ChemRock/Rail end-use market declined 19%, driven by the unusually strong balance volume in the second quarter of 2011, as well as project delays related to rail track maintenance schedules. We anticipate certain of these shipments to be recovered in the second half of the year. We continue to see positive construction trends in the Denver market, as previously communicated, when we exchanged our river assets for assets in Colorado, we increased our exposure to winter weather. The front range of the Rocky mountains experiences a later start to the construction season, than markets along the southern portions of the Mississippi river. Still, the Colorado operations once again, outperformed our expectations for the quarter, and had break even operational profitability, generating EBITDA in excess of the previously mentioned river markets. The average selling price in our heritage aggregates product line increased 2.4% over the prior year quarter. The west group reported the highest increase, 5.4%, which was supported by pricing in south Texas, to the energy sector. These shipments are primarily from sales yards, which have a higher average selling price, compared with producing queries; due to transportation costs from our producing locations to a sales yard. Our product aided the 4.7% heritage aggregates product line pricing increase for our southeast group, we're none the less pleased to see price increases in all segment markets, despite the groups growing decline. Finally, heritage aggregates product-line pricing for our mid-east group declined approximately 1%. This reduction, however, reflects changes in the geographic mix of shipments, which further lower the average selling price variance by 240 basis points. For the overall aggregates business, which includes the impact of the Denver market, our aggregates product-line average selling price increased 1/2%, over the prior year quarter. Remember though, that aggregates product-line shipments in the Denver market, reflect lower average selling prices compared with the company average, due to both geographic and product mix.  As we've previously discussed, it's reasonable to expect a 30% to 40% difference in sales price, driven by these mix issues. Proper inventory control is an important operational discipline. During the quarter, we adjusted production and reduced our heritage aggregates product-line inventory levels. The inventory reduction lowered gross profit by $8.4 million compared with the prior year quarter. Our operating teams continued their focus on cost control, limiting the increase in heritage aggregates product-lines cost per ton, to 1%, inclusive of the impact of reduced production volumes. Also, reversing a multi-quarter trend, energy costs benefited from a slight reduction in diesel fuel prices, and remained essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our average price for diesel fuel was $3.03 per gallon, compared with $3.08 per gallon in the prior year quarter. Our specialty products business benefited from strong demand for both chemical and dolomitic lime products, and generated net sales of $50.4 million; which represents the second quarter record. Despite increased direct input costs, this business generated an operating margin of 34.6%. On a consolidated basis, gross margin was 20.8%, a 300 basis point decline compared with the three year prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the inventory control measures discussed previously.  We continue to focus on what we believe is industry leading performance in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. In that respect, these expenses declined 40 basis points, as percentage of net sales. The absolute increase o $4.3 million is due to incremental overhead incurred in our Denver operations, and costs related to our planned information systems upgrade. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses in our Denver operations, since we continue to integrate them into our disciplined cost structure. Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $59.3 million, inclusive of $9.2 million of business development expenses; excluding the $0.12 per-diluted share charge for these expenses, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.92 for the quarter. Inclusive of these expenses, earnings per diluted share were $0.80, compared with $0.78 in the prior quarter. For the first six months of the year, cash provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of business development expenses, was $52.6 million. Days sales outstanding, was 43 days, an improvement compared to 2011.  We continue to invest in the new lime kiln being constructed by our specialty products Woodville, Ohio facility. We expect this project to be substantially completed during the fourth quarter, and thereafter generate annual net sales ranging from $22 to $25 million, with margins comparable to current levels. During the first six months of the year, we invested $66 million in various capital initiatives, including $22 million for the new kiln. We also maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At June 30, 2012 our ratio consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, was 3.63 times in compliance with the limits under our debt covenants. We remain optimistic about our performance in the second half of the year. We continue to expect our infrastructure end-use market volumes to range from flat, to down slightly. We anticipate double-digit growth in non-residential shipments, driven by increased energy sector demand. Residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate, compared to the level of improvement in 2011. Finally, we expect ChemRock/Rail volume to range from flat to down slightly, depending on the timing of the previously mentioned [inaudible] projects. Overall, for the full year, in our heritage aggregate product line, we expect volume to increase 4% to 5%, pricing to increase 2% to 4%, and direct production costs to be flat. SG&A expenses, exclusive of the incremental expense for our Denver operations, and costs related to our information systems upgrade, are expected to decline slightly compared with 2011. Earnings for our specialty products segment are expected to range from $68 to $70 million.  We expect interest expense to remain flat this year, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%, exclusive of discrete events; and capital expenditures are fore-casted $155 million. This CapEx estimate includes the remaining capital for the new kiln at our specialty products business. We look forward to building on the positive first half trends, in the second half of the year. We remain confident that our disciplined operating approach will deliver results, that enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions, we'll be happy to address your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnold Ursaner, of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Hi, good afternoon Ward. My first question is the 60% incremental margin target that you had spoken about previously, you mentioned that you had it in April and May. Do you have any reason that your target of 60% incremental margin is not achievable on a go-forward basis? Maybe expand on some of the factors behind it.
Ward Nye: Sure, Arnie. Thanks for your question. The short answer is we continually believe that the 60% incremental margin is attainable, with volume recovery. If we look at April, volume recovery was up 8.8%, if we look at May volume was up 7.3%. So if you look at those two months, as we discussed, it was 8%. The fact is, we believe strongly that we can hit those incremental margins, when we watch the next, call it, 40 millions tons come back. Keep in mind, we're 80 million tons away from where we were at peak. Oart of what's important here though, Arnie, is it does have to come back across the enterprise, and that's really part of what we were seeing in April and May. The other component that I would remind you of, and we discussed this before. Markets like North Carolina and the southeast are dis-proportionally profitable markets for us. So, when we're looking at volumes down 10% in the southeast, and when we're looking at what was a challenging period of volume for north Carolina, those two markets do tend to put a particular drag on that incremental margin target. But again, if we see volume come back across the enterprise, we're very confident in that incremental margin target.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: My final question if I could. I think you said $8.4 million hit from the planned inventory reduction plan. Can you give us the quantity or the tonnage, decline that you had from inventory? Perhaps walk us back through the math around the $8.4 million item you mentioned.
Ward Nye: I can certainly take you through that. What we're talking about Arnie, is basically a reduction in inventory of about 3.5 million tons. So if you take a look at the production tonnage that we had in Q2 '12, versus Q2 '11, we actually produced less tonnage in '12 than we did in '11. We took our inventory volumes down by 3.5 million tons; so fully call it 10% of the heritage volume, worth of volume, just went out. Frankly, came out of inventory. Keep in mind, when you're working in a volume environment that we're in today, you're probably running with fixed costs somewhere near 70%. When you're in that type of volume environment, with that type of fixed cost structure, when you do bring volumes down, you're simply going to feel it to the tune of that $8.4, $8.5 million. So, from an operating perspective, it was entirely the right thing to do. We've discussed where we've been with inventories for some time, but hopefully that put some metrics to it.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Thank you, very much.
Ward Nye: You're very welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil, with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Hi, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Let's talk about the second half of the year for a minute. Obviously there's a fair amount of concern about the macro economic environment. You guys kept your guidance unchanged. You talked a little bit about the second half and sort of what your specific expectations are there. Can you give us a feel for what's underlying that, and what you're seeing that makes you feel as confident as you seem to be in that?
Ward Nye: Sure. Well, Todd, as you recall, we indicated we though volume would be up 4% to 5%. If we take a look at really, the bottom end of that range, and what it takes us to get there. I'll try to take you through the different buckets, and give you a sense of that. We expect an infrastructure of slow downs in the second half, so we're actually showing second half volumes down in infrastructure, down around 1.6%. Now non-res, particularly driven by energy had a nice first half. We saw that volume up around 12%. Based on what we're seeing right now, we think that will likely replicate itself again, in the second half. If you look at res, res was up 15% in half one, and obviously there's a lot of activity in res right now; at least comparatively. We're actually seeing res, in our numbers, slow down in the second half. If there's some place where there may be some upside, I think candidly, that may be it. We saw res up 15%, half one, we're showing it up only 9%, half two. Then if you assume that we're not going to see the same level of down in ChemRock/Rail; in half one, we saw that down 9%. We're seeing that down 2% in half two. That at least gives you some degree of book-ends around the different percentages that we're talking about, and the different end uses. If I come back and take a look at those, none of those percentages seem to be particularly unrealistic to me, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: That's great. Thanks for that. You mentioned 2013, in your press release, when you were talking about MAP 21. I can't resist taking the opportunity to ask if you want to give us an early indication on what you think next year might look like. Whether it's for infrastructure as a result of that, or just broadly speaking.
Ward Nye: Well, you can't resist, I probably can resist, Todd. Actually Todd, I do think the highway bill, is clearly going to be something that's helpful to this industry. When Secretary LaHood came out with his announcement around much of that, he said that he thought this was going to give some degree of interest, to an area that truly has [inaudible] and I don't disagree with that. As you recall, for the last couple of years, about the only sector of our business that we said we thought had [inaudible] demand, was in ag-line. I do think there is [pinup] demand around the larger multi-year projects, and I think what we have in MAP 21, at least giving a clear two year snapshot of what we have, is going to be helpful. Keep in mind, I didn't think we would see a highway bill, so I think this is a better place than I thought we would be. I think that in addition to the flat funding, I would suggest to you Todd, that it's pretty good. I think if you look at the reform provisions that are in it, those are going to matter, I think, quite a bit as we go through. I would particularly encourage people to look at the TIFIA program. Because that's going to end up, I think, putting a considerable amount of money out there, that people will be able to use. You can look at the projects that have been bid in the TIFIA program since 1998, they're simply going to be much more robust, going forward. In fact, again, I think it was last Friday, LaHood announced that there would be immediately available $17 billion of TIFIA loans. So by the time you end up putting the leverage amount to that, you can have something coming out of TIFIA, I believe, that can be much more important to the industry, than for example, the prior stimulus bill was.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: That's great. Thanks for that.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee:   You had talked about the possibility of medium price increases this year. Are you seeing that come through the way you anticipated? 
Ward Nye: You know what? We have certainly seen mid-year price increases. They have not been across the board as much as they would have been last year, at least by market. We've seen increases in certain markets in the east, primarily for ready-mix stone. We have seen mid-year price increases as you would expect in portions of the southwest. We've seen price increases in San Antonio, we've seen fine and course aggregate pricing go up, in some places as much as $1.00 a ton. In Houston, we've seen mid-year price increases on aggregates anywhere form $1.00 to9 $1.50 a ton, we've seen sand and gravel go up in that market as well. We've seen similar price increases in south Texas. The one area in Texas that we have not seen the mid-year price increases stick, is in DFW. As you recall, we're not really the market leader in DFW, but we've certainly seen what we believe, is productive mid-year price increases in San Antonio, Houston and south Texas.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Great. Final question from me. In the inventory reductions, can you just talk about what drove your decision to make that? Was it particular product and market driven? Going forward, are you looking to produce in line with shipments, or are there further productions to come? Thanks.
Ward Nye: It was not driven by any single product, Todd. It was really across the spectrum. What I would suggest to you, is as volumes come through next year, particularly after MAP 21, I think you'll see more of a draw down in base products. This is simply the way we run our business, this is not unusual for us to go and adjust the inventories down. We'll continue to watch what we thin shipments are going to be, and we'll try to manage that in a way that we think is responsible. So, I don't want to sit here at this moment and tell you exactly what our plan will be, because we will watch that as the year unfolds.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Thanks, very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier, with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good afternoon everyone.
Ward Nye: What's up Rodny.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: You had highlighted in your prepared remarks [inaudible] during the second quarter, and as I'm thinking about your guidance of 4% to 5% for the full year, could you perhaps break out on a regional basis, your outlook for the segments?
Ward Nye: I'll try to break it out on an end use basis. Really, if we look at the way the trends are going right now Rodney, clearly I think we can all say the west is going to be a more robust area for the country, for the rest of this year, than the east is going to be. I think, at the same time, if we come back and look at our mid-east group, the deferrals that we saw of some volume in the mid-east, particularly in north Carolina, is fairly notable. If we took a look at some rather large projects, there's a fairly large project on I-5 crossing the Yadkin river, that was delayed. We've seen some lining projects on I-85 around Charlotte delayed. We've seen some delays on highway 311, which is going through the middle of the state, really, in Randolph County. Even as we get to the eastern part of the state, there were some delays on the Welmington Bypass, and of course, we've had good military work throughout our enterprise, because of our different locations, and we saw some delays at Camp Lejeune. So if I come back and say to you, broadly, we do anticipate volumes to be stronger in the west, we do anticipate seeing a stronger second half, clearly in the mid-east, and I think the area that's simply going to lag is what we're seeing in the south-east right now. I think that's driven by a number of different factors. I think the economic factors in the southeast are pretty powerful.  If we just take a look at what employment situations are like right now in Florida, Georgia and in south Carolina; looking back where they were at peak, and where they are today. They're 55% below peak today. In Georgia it's down 37%, north Carolina 34%, south Carolina is down 40%. At the same time, housing, which is driving a lot of the activity in many parts of the country. Let's celebrate the fact that it's up 28% right now, but at the same time, on a seasonally adjusted rate, that's 780,000 units; versus a norm of 1.4 to 1.5 per annum. I think if we look at the southeast, and here's a factoid for you, I think we can tie it back in, very directly, apply it to our southeastern lag. If we look at 1,000 homes in the US, what you can assume is around 4.3 of those homes are in some degree of foreclosure. That's not a very heartwarming statistic, and it gets even uglier when we talk about Georgia and Florida, because Georgia has got 8.3 of them in some degree of foreclosure, out of 1,000, and Florida at 8.6. So, I try to give you at least some data, that I think comes back to underscore what we said in the west, and the mid-east, and the southeast, Rodny. The one thing that I would say is this. It's been remarkably dry in portions of the west, this year, and in particular parts of Iowa. I think that may end up putting some degree of duress on the agriculture community there, if they don't get some rain soon. Of course, what that can actually do is impact your AG line volume at the end of the year. So, Rodny I hope that was helpful.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: That was very helpful. Not to focus on the laggard here, but looking at the southeast segment, with volumes down 10%, just looking at the restated volumes that you have, it was on a pretty similar comp to the first quarter. So, the first quarter was up 5%, and this quarter was down 10%. Was there anything specific, that happened this quarter, that really drove that market to just deteriorate, at a faster pace? 
Ward Nye: I don't think there was anything horribly specific. I think there were several things that are rather general, and I think one of the issues that we need to watch, is what happens today in the state of Georgia; because that is when we're going to see what the full results are, on the 1% sales tax that Georgia is trying to put in, in [inaudible] districts. I think, clearly not having a good viable funding mechanism in the Georgia DOP, is something that does cause them some concern. The other issue I would mention, and we didn't put in the press release, and I didn't put it in my prepared remarks because it's an outdoor sport. I mean, you did have a tropical storm that came through, Debbie did come through in June; and to say that Florida and Georgia escaped that without any effect, would be entirely right. When storms come through, you just deal with them.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  All right. Thank you. That's very helpful.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Rodny.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Your line is open.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Good afternoon, Ward.
Ward Nye:  How are you doing, Jack?
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital:  I'm doing all right. Thanks. What do you think happened in June? I mean, seems like declines were fairly widespread and was it something you guys saw coming or did it catch the industry a bit by surprise?
Ward Nye:  I think perhaps the degree to which there was a decline. I think it caught the industry by surprise. I think when you're looking at double-digit numbers down in Georgia and you're looking at double-digits down in part of North Carolina and double-digits down in South Carolina, I think those are bigger numbers than what people would have expected. At the same time, when I remember that we're talking about North Carolina and South Carolina and Georgia, those aren't states that you would expect to stay down. These are states that have broad, good, solid economies. But I think to answer your question directly, Jack, it was a deeper fall in June, but I think people would have expected.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: And with regard to the residential piece where are expecting not quite a gain in volume in the second half versus the first. When I look at the housing starts in single-family starts, there, right now anyway, at the highest level of the year. So as your guidance there reflects some of those market specific factors or just more of some conservatism, even given that housing has gained a little momentum lately?
Ward Nye: I think that's a fair point, Jack and I think that the comments will filter around that in the earlier Q&A was. I think if there's a place here that we probably benefit punitive to ourselves, it may well be on the res side. I was out in San Antonio here a few weeks ago and I was in Florida for part of the other week, as well, and, Jack, what I'm seeing is I'm seeing activity in the field that feels like, in some respects, that I'm back in 2006. We're seeing people cutting in new subdivisions. It's not just that they're building homes, they're paving streets, they're building sidewalks, they're putting in curb and gutter. So I do think the housing piece is a very good story right now and I don't want to soft sell that. I think that is good and it's clearly more important to this industry than I think people would have believed.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Sure. Well, it's been a while since we've seen it, obviously. And I'm pricing, you mentioned some of the markets where pricing has been good and you're getting some mid-year price increases, but you've also said on this call, as well as for, I think, a few quarters at least, that it is choppy, I guess, maybe is the word or sporadic in terms of the ability to get pricing. There still some important markets out there where pricing is somewhat competitive and that's, if it happened in the wrong market, it can really affect margin. I mean is that something that you're dealing with?
Ward Nye:  No, and I wouldn't say that it's hard to get price. I think what I'm more saying is in some markets it's not as easy to get a mid-year price right now, Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Okay.
Ward Nye:  If I'm looking at our pricing again in a very tepid volume environment, realistically this is still the way I measure it, a pretty good story.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Jack.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research:  Thank you. I just have a follow-up question with respect to the inventory control measures you took in the second quarter. I was wondering if you could break out, perhaps, by reason how much of $8 million was spread across where?
Ward Nye: You know, well, Garik, I could probably go back and take a look at that. I can't break that out for you right now and give you a good spread of exactly where that was. I don't think there was any particular area that really drove. I think we pretty much did that across the portfolio. I think there might have been a little bit more east of the Mississippi, but as a practical matter we also had better business west of the Mississippi, but I think that's probably as good as I can give you right.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. And then, I guess, as we think about the close margin in back half of the year, looking for a mid single-digit volume growth, some pricing lift. All things being equal, especially with diesel tapering off, could we expect gross margin expansion year-over-year in the back half of the year, meaning some of these revenue growth opportunities will more than offset some of the negative mixed issues that you're seeing geographically?
Ward Nye: Garik, I don't think that's something that you should dismiss at all. I think that primary driver is going to be volume and where the volume is. I think those are going to be the two issues that, if I were you and it being me, that those are two things that I'm going to watch. How much and where.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. Fair enough. And, I guess, just a question on non-residential demand. The (inaudible) energy has been very strong for you in the first half of the year. I just wondered may be if you could provide some color on what you're seeing in the more traditional and non-res end markets, office and retail, end markets like that?
Ward Nye: It continues to get better, but I will tell you it's getting better from a very, very, very low point right now, Garik, and we're seeing that better in a number of markets. I'm seeing that better in Ohio. I'm seeing it better in Indiana. I'm seeing good warehousing distribution. I'm seeing portions of that in the Mid-Atlantic and we're clearly seeing good activity along those lines in places like Kansas City and in the Western U.S. So, if we come back and really look at what non-res, really more the lighter side of it is doing, we're seeing better activity than we've seen in a long time; Florida probably being one of the few places right now, on that piece, of still not an enormous amount of activity.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. And then, I guess, this question is just housekeeping. I was wondering if you could provide the number of gallons of diesel you consumed in the second quarter?
Ward Nye: I can. It looks like in Q2 we consumed about 7.5 million gallons of diesel fuel. So for half one we were 13.5 million gallons, and, just so you'll know, usually Q3 is our highest diesel fuel consumption period.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Great. Thanks so much.
Ward Nye: Sure, Garik.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group:  And I thank you for taking my questions today. I was going to see if you could just give me a little bit more clarity on volumes on apples-to-apples basis just to reconfirm you're gaining about 8 million tons in fiscal '12 from Denver and taking out about 6.5 million from other divested assets and other related assets. And taking those to account, how did the Denver assets perform on a year-to-year basis versus your core asset base volume performance in the quarter?
Ward Nye: Sure, Kathryn. Let me address that. Actually, what we've said before it the 8 million tons that I think you're referencing is not just Denver. That's the cumulative tonnage from the acquisitions last year. So that would include Denver and it would include San Antonio. But let me do this, let me come back and try to help you a little bit on Denver because I can understand that that's something that you want to try to bring some clarity to it. If we look at it for the quarter, we shipped around 1.6 million tons of aggregates in Denver. It was around 485,000 tons of hot mix and around 230,000 cubic yards of Ready-mix and generated approximately $60 million net sales from the acquired Denver business. So if we look at that we had something in Denver for the quarter that really getting its lights under it. It was EBITDA positive for the quarter and, again, part of what we're intrigued by like and what we're seeing in Denver, Kathryn, is the rate of growth in highly construction awards in Colorado as ranking among the highest in the country and also looking at what their relative to decreasing construction-related unemployment is pretty impressive. Colorado added jobs at a rate of 4.2% versus the national average of 1.9%. And that's really going back even to the last question. This is one of the markets where we're seeing a nice uptick in non-res and residential construction. And to give you more of a sense of it, during the quarter we bid on nearly 1,200 different projects in Colorado, up and down the front range. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how that market is starting evolve and growing into something that we thought it would, but it also gives you some volume and some revenue metrics around Denver. The other thing that I would point out to you too is if you went back and took a look at the way the TIFIA program has worked, even historically, Colorado's been one of the better states at coming up with projects of a national or regional significance and getting (inaudible) dollars put into those. Is that something to say all you need, Kathryn?
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Yeah, and I was just looking at Denver. How much is that non-res demand is really more energy driven versus your core, kind of, other category in non-res?
Ward Nye: You know what? Actually, not a lot of it is purely energy driven there. I mean, what you'll see coming out of there is really going to a (inaudible) deposit and the type of tonnage that we would see going to (inaudible) compared to anything that we might be seeing in the Barnett, for example, which way down, or the Haynesville, which is down, or even the Marcellus, that we don't have the huge presence in. It's not as much as we would see in any of those other deposits. So when we're talking about non-res in that market, it truly is what you would think about it. It's the Westin that's going up at the Denver Airport and it's other projects of that nature.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. And doing the pricing, how much does mix account for in the upside in the quarter?
Ward Nye: You know what, it really doesn't count for much of the upside. In fact, mix was clearly a headwind on what we experienced in the Mid-East. The only place that we got really a tailwind that was appreciable on mix was in the Southeast where I want to say we up, what was it 4 and some percent, and I want to say it was around 200 basis of that that was a positive mix effect. Aside from that, it wasn't a great moment for the quarter.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: And then going back to inventory reduction, even if this had been for good or for ill kind of an issue for the industry in general, really since the stimulus program got going and had having to battle through base inventories. Here's my question to you, I think it's great you're EBITDA, focusing on inventories, but, and you talked a little bit about it earlier in the Q&A, but maybe you can help me understand a little bit better inventory, particularly basis, has been an issue for the downturn. Why maybe focus a little bit more in this quarter or is there an opportunity maybe to unload a type of inventory that you hadn't had the opportunity before because of different demand trends?
Ward Nye: No, the demand trends didn't change from our (inaudible) plan and Lord knows the problem with the industry right now is there's not enough opportunities to unload volume anywhere right now, Kathryn. That's the real challenge that we're faced with. And simply recognizing that, to your point, if you're going to be in a mode for much of the last several years that you're producing principally a clean washed stone material. You were going to build some other inventories. You are doing to have to go back and run your plants at times in a different mode and you will build up some inventories and you do have to manage it. So there was nothing that was particularly magic about this quarter, it's obviously easier to the extent that you're going to sell out of inventory to do it when you feel like you're in the right season to get much of that done. So that's simply what drove it.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. Great. And, finally, is anything on the impact of the drought on your ag line business?
Ward Nye: It's hard to say that there will or won't be an impact right. That was really just going back to what we've felt like the puts and takes and maybe with respect to volume later in the year. Obviously, we've had a couple of good years of ag line volume. I think the need for ag line in many respects is still there. At the same time, if the crops end up, in large part, being subject to drought and the farmers find themselves in a more distressed place at the end of the year, then they won't buy as much ag line. That's simply the way that market works. I don't think we're to the point that any of us can say that that's where the farmers are, but at the same time, I think that's something that they are probably watching right now. If they are, we are.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Ward Nye: Sure, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Thank you. Hi, guys. How're you doing?
Ward Nye: Good. How are you?
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Great. So I had a quick question. I apologize if I missed, but on specialty products, revenue up 2%, gross profit better at 7%, operating profit down 9%, margins down 420 basis points. You know, so, otherwise, revenue up $2 million, profit down $2 million. You say that higher raw material costs, I think contract services and repairs, I wondered if you could give us a little better sense for what the raw material issue was in the quarter? How to think about? If it's a cyclical issue? If it's something other than... is it natural gas, is it some other raw materials and starting point?
Ward Nye: Well, to tell you the truth, really, Ted, is we went back and looked at that. Some of it was simply in supplies and explosives. Some of it was in repairs. Some of it was just in pure maintenance. We had some issues with respect to lime, but at the same time the issue that we're faced with right now is a few hundred thousand dollars here, a few hundred thousand dollars there, you get up to something that, $1 million, $1.5 million. I don't think it's anything that's really likely recur or be that notable. At the same time I think you and I both look at those margins and take them every day of the week and that team has done very well. The one thing I will say to you is that nat gas has been our friend up there. If we look at the way nat gas has worked historically, we had looked at the energy profile for that business, nat gas clearly would have been the single largest component of that and as we sit there today, coal and electricity and nat gas really on a percentage basis are all about the same for that business right now, so. It wasn't any one thing, Ted, it was just a series of smaller things that, as I've looked at them, and as John Harmon, who runs that business very well for us, looks at them, we're not particularly alarmed by what we saw.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. So not to nag on it, but I agree. It's a phenomenal business. So it's been extraordinary to the downturn and upturn, but just when it comes back to thinking about the profitability on a go-forward basis, it's a business that's historically put up some really impressive incremental in the 50%, 60% range and you had 220% decremental this quarter. And so just in terms of calibrating our expectations, I know you reaffirmed the $68 million to $70 million of pre-tax profits, but it's still a pretty big swing. So if you start heading up a couple hundred thousand dollar things here and there, you still come to a $4 million net swing, revenue up 2, profits down 2.
Ward Nye: All right. I understand where you're coming from. If I really was concerned about it, to your point, I would have gone back and changed the guidance. I feel confident that we'll be where we are. Still's running at a 77.8% capacity right. Obviously, the input cost with respect to natural gas are in a very attractive place compared to history. We're right on time, right on schedule, right on dollars with the kiln project, as well. Ted, I don't see anything there that for the full year is concerning to me. I feel very good about it.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Great. Because I know you mentioned 77.8% capacity (inaudible). Could you just tell us what it was last year? (inaudible)
Ward Nye: Last year the numbers run 74.5.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Oh, wow. Okay. So nice improvement.
Ward Nye: Yeah.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Great. And then I apologize to go back, I just wanted to touch on the incremental margins in aggregates. I know there was mix, there's the inventory issue, and you talked about giving 60% incrementals in April and May. Was that on the business on a reported basis or was that really the underlying aggregates when you strip out the downstream stuff and any other noise?
Ward Nye: Okay. That was on our aggregates business and the way we report our aggregates business is really if we're looking at... I'm just thinking through it, Ted, there's no downstream, at least appreciably in the east, and, obviously, there is in the west. So what we're talking about on that is the incremental margins with respect to the ags business across the group. So ag rock only.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. The last thing I just want to ask and then I'll just hand off the baton to somebody else, but the (inaudible) costs, can you just talk about kind of what's driving the upgrade. I think what involved your guys as having kind of best of breed technology. Just wondering what exactly you're doing with the total cost will be and how should we think about payback and the anticipated benefits?
Ward Nye: (audio difficulty) Can you hear me?
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Hello? (audio difficulty) Ward, I apologize I don't think you can hear me, but I think something is wrong with my line because I can't hear anything. I'm just going to hang up and they can circle up offline. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Security.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Security: Hi. Can you hear me? (audio difficulty)
Ward Nye: So all told and $8 million upgrade investment, which is simply standard due course and something that we are prepared for and, obviously, we feel like the way we run our business and the importance of our systems is an important and critical investment. Operator, if you can still hear us, I'd like to go to the next call.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mike Betts – Jefferies:  Yes, hello. Can you hear me, Ward?
Ward Nye: The good news, Mike, is I can hear and I'm sorry for whatever happened there. I'm glad all of you could continue to hear us.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Yeah, I'm not sure we could, Ward. I mean maybe I could ask first just simply because I think you broke up to everybody. If you could just summarize. You came back in on the $8 million upgrade on the IT. Was there anything else crucial that you were saying in that? I think we missed that. And then my specific questions were the kiln in the (inaudible) products that's opening later on this year, I mean should be we expect any dilution in margin. I mean should we expect any dilution in margin as that kiln ramps up? I mean will it take some time before it comes up to full production? And, secondly, you've not talked about your lime volume inventory and I know you won't give specific numbers and this stage, but this is basically the trend continued the way it's been in June or is there anything significant that's changed in July in the aggregates business versus June? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Mike, thank you for your questions. Let me go back and try to address the systems question one more time just in case I was cut off and, again, I apologize for whatever technical issues we ran to. On that, it's simply an upgrade to our JDE system. We're looking at about $1 million a quarter for '12 and for '13. So, in other words, it's about an $8 million investment to upgrade that system. So we'll just leave that there. With respect to July, what I'll tell you about July when we're sitting down at our next quarterly call I'll give you a quick update on that, but, obviously, right now that's not a conversation we feel like is appropriate for us to go into. With respect to the new kiln, obviously, what we feel like we can do there is we can bring capacity into the market and the capacity has already got a home in large part in the market. We feel like we will bring the process online here in the fourth quarter. We think we will go through the debugging process and actually what we would anticipate is coming into 2013 with margins coming out of that kiln that very much marry up to what you've seen come out of that business heretofore. So, we're not seeing what we believe will be any degration in that business at all from a margin perspective.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: You don't see even in Q4 when it first starts to come on?
Ward Nye: You know, you can certainly have some degree of debugging for a brief period of time. That would not be wholly unusual again. It is a kiln process, but, Mike, based on what we've seen on the project based on the conversations that we're having regularly with our teams and based on the track record that they have I don't want to spread anything that would be material.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay. And then just one final question, Ward, If I may. I think you also altered the guidance slightly on your heritage (inaudible) production cost from the decline to flat. Was that just the inventory issue or was there anything else behind that?
Ward Nye: No, Mike, it was primarily the inventory issue. You're exactly right.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Thank you very much, Ward.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman – DA Davidson:  Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.
Ward Nye: Sure, Brent.
Brent Thielman – DA Davidson: First on Texas. You mentioned some of the strength in the energy sector in residential and I'm just wondering, have you seen the public side slow at all in that market or is it just more steady as it goes?
Ward Nye: You know, I'll tell you, the market in Texas just feels pretty good right now. I mean there's just no doubt about that. I mean if we look at the 12-month contract awards, it's around $4.9 billion. What I'm hearing, and obviously that's an August fiscal year state. I mean they have it come out exactly what their budget's going to be, but I'm certainly hearing budgets out of (inaudible) or spending that could be well in excess of anything we've seen the last several years. So we're looking at something that we think in Texas, for the next 18 to 24 months, just on the public infrastructure side, is likely to be very strong. At the same time, if you're looking at markets like San Antonio, the residential recovery has been really something to see. I mean home values hit a two-year high in June, multi-family continues to be a 93% occupancy rate and if we look at just new projects we added there for the quarter, I count up nearly 11 new projects that we added just in San Antonio. At the same time we know the Eagle-Ford deposit is booming. I think one component that will likely come out of Texas that I'm not sure everyone completely appreciated, is how many secondary or foreign market roads are being absolutely destroyed by the activity that's going on in the Eagle-Ford shale deposit right now. So by the this process is done it won't just be stone going into the shale fields, it will be stone going into the roads that need considerable repair. And then even if we look at places like Houston right now, we're looking in the core development that's launching generation part that's a $5 billion development there. Exxon-Mobile is looking to put a new chemical plant in Mont Belvieu and, of course, the Grand Parkway that's going to be a 38-mile project, $1 billion of The Woodlands are all very considerable projects, many of which has strong commercial components to them, as well. So what we're seeing in Texas right now is a beautiful thing. We just wish we saw it in other markets, as well.
Brent Thielman – DA Davidson: That's really helpful. And then just a clarification in the other big market, North Carolina. Were all the project delays sort of weather associated or were there any issues there?
Ward Nye: I don't think weather had that profound an impact in North Carolina. We did get some rain in June that probably delayed some of them. I think much of it, you look at it and we look at it too in terms of what's it looking like this quarter. I think most owners and most DOTs aren't necessarily looking at it that way. They're looking at it more within the confines of a construction season. So I think to the extent that we saw something or you may see something pushed to the right 45 days, that's a much greater moment to people from the outside looking in than it is to a DOT or an owner.  So I don't think there was anything fundamentally or structurally that was different. I think we're just seeing the good and sometimes the not so pretty components of the way constructions works.
Brent Thielman – DA Davidson: Got you. Thanks a lot. Best of luck in the second half.
Ward Nye: Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Desi DiPierro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets:  Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned each of the volume rates of April, May and June and it appeared that things kind of got worse as the quarter went along and you said that the 5.5% decline in June reflected project delays and economic uncertainty. Are you able to breakout what portion of that you think is more due to project delays or a deteriorating economic environment.
Ward Nye: You know it's hard break that out. I think as we look at a market that clearly matters a lot to us and that is North Carolina. I think some of the larger projects that we would assuming would go were simply project delays. So I think as we're looking at the East Coast, that the Mid-Atlantic, that's really more of the issue because we're seeing good steady business in Indiana and Ohio, primarily driven by highways. The driver in North Carolina would continue to be highways, although we're seeing much better economic activity around Charlotte than we've seen for a while, as well. I think back to my earlier comments, I think the issues in much of the pure Southeast, and by that I mean Florida and Georgia, and Georgia, in particular, are more driven not so much by delays, but by what's going on in that economy and I hope that geographic divide was responsive.
Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. That's good. And then also, obviously, you didn't product Southeast would be down 10% this quarter when you issued your previous guidance of plus 4% to 5%. And since you're maintaining that is that assumed that the other areas are doing better you guys initially expected?
Ward Nye: You know I think clearly the west is having a very robust year. I think, again, as we look at what we have in backlogs and it's one reason that I try to go through each end use segment as carefully as I did and speak to the very specific increases or decrease in the infrastructure component, for example, that we thought we might see in the second half to show you how that build would be to get to the bottom end of our range. We're comfortable with where we sit right now.
Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure. Thank you, Desi.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliot of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliot - Stifel Nicolaus & Company:  Great. Thank you very much. Back to the TIFIA program, it doesn't sound like there's going to be much of an impact this year with your outlook for the back half of the year, but the way that the modifications that they made this program, can you all expect that kind of have sort of the same benefits as the regular (inaudible) 21 program when construction season starts in the first quarter, second quarter or is this more of a longer term type situations because of the partnerships being involved with all that?
Ward Nye: I think anytime its tied to this type of a build its going to be longer term by nature and so I think if we go back and think about it. I would saw we haven't talked much about (inaudible) because it hasn't been that big of a deal, but [TIFIA] has been around, as I understand, originally since 1998. So, if you go back and take a look at some of the projects that we benefited from, particular with respect to TIFIA, and we'll continue to, I mean, in Denver we're seeing U.S. 36 and managed lanes project. TIFIA was actually some of funding for the Denver Union Station and Texas, it's money behind the 635, which is the LBJ managed lanes projects. Also, the North Triangle Expressway. And even here in North Carolina on the Triangle Expressway, which was our first modern toll road that had TIFIA dollars in it, as well. I mean clearly we're looking at what, $750 million of TIFIA dollars of '13, $1 billion next year. So $1.7 billion. If the secretary's numbers are right and you put a ten time multiple to that, that's $17 billion of TIFIA loans. And I think part of what's going to be remarkable as we watch TIFIA, I think this is going to be important to see is the maximum potential TIFIA share of project costs have basically gone from 33% to 49%. So in other words, its possible to take that $17 billion and assume that you might even see a distal leverage put to that and I think if we start looking at a $2.00 to $3.00 form of leverage, even of that $17 billion, that goes back to why I feel like TIFIA in the final analysis may well be more profound than even stimulus was coming into the sector. I think TIFIA is going to be something to watch. I many what LaHood has called it is the largest infrastructure loan program in history and that doesn't sound like a bad right now to me.
Stanley Elliot - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Nope. Not at all. Great. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Sure, Stanley. 
Operator:  Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.
Ward Nye: Well, thank you again for joining our second quarter 2012 earnings call and your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. We're encouraged by the first half trends, particularly the passage of a new highway bill and anticipate building on this momentum throughout the year into 2013 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2012 results with you in November. Thanks for your time today and for your support of our company.
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials’ quarterly earnings call. With me is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’re grateful for your time today and the opportunity to share our first quarter 2012 results. As an initial matter, let me remind you that this discussion may include forward-looking statements in connection with future events or future operating or future financial performance. Forward-looking statements in this discussion are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Martin Marietta undertakes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our first quarter 2012 results and to Martin Marietta’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on the SEC’s website. Our first quarter results reflect positive trends in both our aggregates and magnesia specialties businesses, leading us to increase our full-year guidance. Our aggregates business achieved volume and pricing improvements that resulted in expansion of heritage aggregates business gross margin by 250 basis points excluding freight and delivery revenues. Volume growth in each of our end-use markets led to a 9.6% increase in heritage aggregates product line shipments over the prior-year quarter. As expected, our pricing momentum continued and it exceeded our forecast, achieving a 2.8% improvement in average selling price for our heritage aggregates product line over the prior-year quarter. We’re also pleased with first quarter results in our recently acquired operations in the Denver, Colorado area, which benefited from heightened construction activity in the Denver market. Additionally, our Specialty Products business continues to perform well and has again established new records for both quarterly net sales and first quarter earnings from operations. Consolidated first quarter results were predictably hampered by the seasonality of our new Rocky Mountain division. This division’s better than expected performance was achieved despite almost 55 inches of Denver area snowfall this past winter. Whereas the operations along the Mississippi River that we exchanged last December are less susceptible to winter weather, the acquired Denver operations will tend to have weaker first quarter results and realize stronger earnings and cash flows later in the year. For the full year 2012, we expect this River for Rocky Mountain asset exchange to be neutral to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. Importantly, we expect this acquisition to be accretive in 2013. Our quarterly earnings also reflect expenses related to our proposed business combination with Vulcan Materials Company. Excluding the $0.34 per diluted share effect of these expenses and the $0.17 loss per diluted share of the newly acquired operations, our adjusted loss per diluted share improved 23% to $0.30 versus the first quarter of 2011’s loss per diluted share of $0.39. Our heritage aggregates product line volume growth reflects improvement in each of our reportable groups, led by a nearly 12% increase in our West Group. While our aggregates business benefited from mild winter weather in most heritage operating regions, we also saw indications of economic growth bolstering demand. As an example, our Midwest division, which primarily serves Iowa and Nebraska, reported a 34% increase in heritage aggregates product line volumes. Mild weather contributed to a nearly 100% increase in this market’s agricultural lime shipments over the prior-year quarter. Similarly, as counties and municipalities accumulated unspent snow removal funds, this money sometimes is used for roads resurfacing projects, reflecting construction activity that should be incremental for the full year. This division also experienced heightened non-residential shipments, a usually reliable sign of economic growth. As I mentioned, earlier each of our heritage end-use markets grew. The heritage non-residential end-use market led with a 17% increase in aggregates product line shipments over the prior-year quarter. This growth reflected increased shipments for repair and maintenance projects as well as energy sector activity. Heritage aggregate shipments for our residential end-use market increased 8% over the prior-year quarter, led by single-family housing activity. Growth was noteworthy in the San Antonio, Texas area, partially attributable to military base realignment and closure activity. San Antonio data also reveals that multi-family housing is currently at a 93% occupancy rate. There are also encouraging signs in markets such as Charlotte, North Carolina, where a customer who has not bid on any subdivision work in three years now has the opportunity to bid on at least five new projects. Our heritage infrastructure end-use market increased 7% over the prior-year quarter. We are very encouraged by this growth, as this market remains constrained by uncertainties surrounding long-term federal highway funding. Recently, Congress again extended federal funding through June 30. This is the ninth short-term continuing resolution since the long-term federal transportation bill expired in September 2009. During this interim period, states have been pressed to further supplement the funding of infrastructure investment. To that end, we were gratified when the State of Texas announced plans to leverage an additional $2 billion to fund high-priority projects for the next two years. Additionally, in North Carolina, the Garden Park toll road near Charlotte is expected to be bid later this year. Also, the State of North Carolina recently received permission to collect tolls on Interstate 95 as a funding mechanism for plans to overhaul the state’s entire 182 miles of this highway. Our significant presence throughout Texas and North Carolina makes us well positioned to serve these aggregates intensive projects in both the near and longer term. In concluding our comments on heritage end-use markets, ChemRock and rail shipments increased 4% over the prior-year quarter. Heritage aggregates pricing improvement was lead by a nearly 8% improvement in our West Group. In addition to pricing increases implemented during 2011, first quarter pricing benefited by increased sales from distribution yards in South Texas. As you may recall, we developed a new rail located sales yard in South Texas, principally designed to serve Eagle Ford Shale activity. Our Southeast Group reported a pricing increase of 2%, whereas our Mideast average selling price declined nearly 2%. Pricing in our Mideast Group is typically more sensitive to job type. And for the quarter this fluctuation was driven by product mix as we served a certain project with lower priced sand. As expected, the increase in our overall aggregates product line average selling price was less than the increase in our heritage locations. This is due to our newly acquired Denver-based business, which as a reminder is a truck-served market with lower overall average selling prices. Additionally for the quarter, these locations had a higher percentage of sales attributable to base stone versus clean stone when compared with our heritage aggregates business. During the quarter, in response to increased shipments, heritage product line production rose by more than 8%. Although we gain efficiencies with higher production levels, certain direct production costs, including supplies and repairs, are typically negatively affected by unplanned increases early in the year. We also continued to experience higher energy costs in the quarter, led by increased diesel fuel expense. For the quarter, we paid an average of $3.24 per gallon for diesel fuel, 15% more than the prior-year quarter. Overall, energy expenses increased 18% over the prior-year quarter. Despite these cost headwinds, we reduced heritage aggregates production cost per ton slightly compared with the prior-year quarter. On a consolidated basis, cost of sales increased proportionally to the increase in net sales. We continue to focus on controlling our selling, general, and administrative, or SG&A expenses. We reduced these cost by 50 basis points as a percentage of net sales even after adding nearly 500 employees with our three acquisitions completed in 2011. We achieved this result by implementing certain organizational changes in last year’s fourth quarter. This reorganization included the early retirement of several senior executives as well as the realignment of our operating divisions and personnel to better match current business levels. While on an absolute basis SG&A expenses increased $4.4 million, primarily related to our acquisitions, as a percentage of net sales, we believe our SG&A is industry leading. Our operating performance continues to benefit greatly from our Specialty Products segment, which again set new records for both quarterly net sales and first quarter earnings from operations. Net sales of $51.7 million show a 5% increase over the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth in both dolomitic lime and chemicals product lines. Increased sales along with effective cost management resulted in a 440 basis point improvement in the business operating margin over the prior-year quarter excluding freight and delivery revenues. Earnings from operations for the quarter were $18.2 million. To demonstrate the long-term growth of this business, earnings from operations are nearly three times the level achieved in the first quarter of 2009. We continue to invest in the new lime kiln being constructed at our Specialty Products Woodville, Ohio facility. We expect this project to be substantially completed by the end of the year and thereafter generate annual net sales ranging from $22 million to $25 million, with margins comparable to current levels. While focusing on operating our business, we also continue to pursue a business combination with Vulcan Materials. Accordingly, several related developments are ongoing. First, we’re working with the Department of Justice on its regulatory review and to narrow the issues remaining to be discussed. To date, we’re pleased with the progress in this aspect of the proposed transaction and are optimistic that we will resolve the outstanding issues around mid-May. Additionally, we’ve completed a bench trial in the Delaware Chancery Court related to certain aspects of the exchange offer and are awaiting the Chancellor’s ruling. We’re also proceeding with our nomination of four independent directors to the Vulcan Board at its Annual Meeting scheduled for June 1. We believe Vulcan shareholders deserve committed directors that act in their best interest, viewing our offer through an independent lens. As expected, our multiple efforts have financial ramifications. And for the quarter, we incurred $26 million in business development expenses. We continue to believe the combination of our company with Vulcan provides a compelling opportunity to enhance value for shareholders of both companies and are steadfastly committed to making this transaction a reality. During the quarter, we used $4 million for operating activities compared with $21 million provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2011. As expected, the Denver-based operations were a significant factor, as we used approximately $22 million for operating activities at these newly acquired locations. Operating cash flow for the year also reflects the impact of business development costs. Our days sales outstanding was 45 days, unchanged from 2011. We invested $38 million in organic growth capital during the quarter and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At March 31, 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.53 times, in compliance with the limits under our amended debt covenant. We are increasingly optimistic for the rest of the year. And based on first quarter trends, we revised our heritage aggregates product line volume guidance. We now expect infrastructure end-use market volume to range from flat to down slightly. We anticipate double-digit growth in non-residential shipments, driven by increased energy sector demand. Residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate compared with the level of improvement in 2011. Finally, we expect ChemRock and rail volume to be consistent with 2011. Overall, we now expect heritage aggregates product line volume to increase from 4% to 5%. We also expect overall heritage aggregates product line pricing to increase from 2% to 4%. A variety of factors beyond our direct control may exert pressure on our volumes, and our pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across our company. Politically, we are encouraged that the President continues to advocate rebuilding America’s infrastructure. We’re also pleased to continue to see bipartisan Congressional agreement that infrastructure is an essential government priority. Still, since this is an election year, our expectation is that the current federal highway program will be extended only by more continuing resolutions until the end of the year. Our heritage aggregates direct production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly, with increased production generating operating efficiencies. This expectation assumes that production efficiencies will offset increases in energy prices. SG&A expenses exclusive of the incremental expense at our new Denver operations are expected to decline slightly. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses related to the Denver operations as we continue to integrate them into our disciplined cost structure. Earnings for our Specialty Product segment are now expected to range from $68 million to $70 million. We expect interest expense to remain flat this year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%, and capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million. This estimate includes the remaining capital for the new kiln at our Specialty Products business. As a reminder, our expectations for 2012 assume Martin Marietta Materials on a standalone basis and do not consider any effects that would flow from the proposed combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials. This is an exciting time for Martin Marietta and we remain focused on operating our business and delivering results that enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. At the end of today’s call, I’ll offer some additional closing comments. However, if the operator will now give the required instructions, we’d be happy to address your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities. Please go ahead.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Good afternoon, Ward. Good afternoon, Anne. What gives you the confidence to raise your volume expectation for the year? What are the factors you’re focused on?
Ward Nye: Arnie, if we go back and take a look at the different buckets where the volumes are coming from, we’ve seen even up in infrastructure in the first quarter. I know that’s not what we’re seeing for the full year across the entire business or the entire country. But if you look at where Texas is and what their DOT spending is likely to be, if you look at where North Carolina is, if you look at a state like Iowa that has the largest DOT program in its state’s history this year, those are all important states for us. I think more importantly though is we come back and look at some of the other buckets. If we look at non-res, clearly the activity we’ve seen in energy last year coming into this year continues to be good. But I think what really gives us some confidence is we’re seeing movement beyond just energy in non-res. We’re seeing new data centers. We’re seeing distribution centers being built. And then even as we go into the residential market, what we’re seeing with respect to housing is a pretty good story. We talked a little bit about what we were seeing in San Antonio in the prepared remarks, but we’re seeing good single-family activity in a number of markets across our business. We also continue to see a lot of multi-family activity as well. We’re seeing that in places like Wilmington, North Carolina. The coastal areas of the Carolinas have been pretty hard hit the last couple of years. And when we’re seeing new apartment complexes going up, that’s giving us a lot of confidence. And then finally, even what we have in ChemRock and Rail where callings were to be relatively flat for the year, clearly what we’ve seen in Ag lime in the first part of the year tells us there continues to be pent up demand in that sector. So, Arnie, as I picked and marched through those buckets, that’s a quick snapshot that I’m seeing, and I think that does give us confidence that the volume growth is going to be there.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: That’s very thorough and thank you. And just as a follow-up, the 250 basis points improvement you had in margin, can you go through some of the factors that are in your view of the sustainability of the margin improvement?
Ward Nye: Clearly this is something we’ve been doing for a while, so we are not newbies to taking out cost and we continue to look at it. I’m proud of what we’ve done with the costs in this quarter, particularly given the fact that we’ve been doing this for a while now. I’ll tell you what really gave me some even greater appreciation of what our operating teams did. We actually moved considerably more material by rail this quarter than we have in previous Q1s. My last number in my mind tells me that we moved around 38% more material by rail this quarter going from operating locations to new yards or other yards than we did in the prior quarter. If we take a look at that, it would even put more even behind the 260 basis points. So as we look at what we came in with and what it really would have been more on a same-on-same, we’re pretty encouraged by that. The other thing I’ll remind you too, Arnie, is we all get excited when we talk about volumes being up 9.6%. That sounds like a great number, but that’s still 23.8 million tons. When I go back and compare that to history, that’s a little bit less than we did in 2009 when we were at about 24.5 million tons. And last time I checked, 2009 wasn’t a great year in our economy either. So when we see that type of margin on that type of volume, particularly in a Q1, I feel pretty good about it, and I do feel like it is sustainable, and I think we can continue to do quite well with it.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Terrific, thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Arnie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Thanks. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne.
Ward Nye: How are you doing, Todd?
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Doing well, thanks. Looking at your guidance, you’ve given the volume and price guidance on a heritage basis. Can you translate that to an absolute nominal basis for us?
Ward Nye: Really what I would do – let me approach it this way, Todd. Let’s go back and talk about the acquisition effect because I think that can probably help you. If we just looked at total heritage volume, I want to say that was probably up seven points, total volume up about 7.3%, pricing up around 1.1%. I think if you go back and take a look at really what the big chunk of the acquisition is, it’s really going to be Denver, although we clearly did buy a business in San Antonio midyear last year. So if you come back with that and assume, we’re probably looking at an incremental 8 million tons on those acquisitions on the stone side, probably an incremental 800,000 cubic yards on the ready-mix side, and around 1.5 million on the hot mix side. I think that will probably get you where you want to be, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Got it, thank you. That helps a lot. Thinking about the Colorado assets, you provided us with a pre-tax and after-tax impact of that operation. Could you tell us what gross profit was?
Ward Nye: You can see that it cost us $0.17 for the quarter. And what I would encourage you to do, just assume that that’s going to be tough to make up to the full year. And keep in mind what we said is that’s a business that’s going to be accretive to us in 2013. What we like is the timing in which we’ve come into that market. Let me give you some facts to think about relative to Denver as we look at the business, Todd. I was reading AGC America the other week. It stated that Denver leads the nation in new construction jobs. And if you look at the 12 months ended in February, it added around 6,300 jobs. With respect to homes in the Denver market from really when the trough hit, we’ve seen inventory down around 42%. Multifamily is up 21%, and we’re seeing new subdivisions come into that market as well. So even if we look at our ready-mix business there and our hot-mix business there, we’re seeing nice levels of bidding activity, not just on subdivisions, but we’re seeing work at the University of Colorado student housing. We’re seeing work at the VA hospital. We’re seeing Denver Museum of Sciences work. And even when we look at HMA, we’re seeing good municipal work, and bidding has accelerated pretty considerably. We’ve actually bid on in excess of 500 projects in that market. So you’ll recall the strategic reasons that we thought moving into Denver was a nice move and a good time for Martin Marietta to have a one or two position in Denver, so hopefully with that volume data that I’ve given you and at least some of the market detail that I’ve provided, that can help you some more in Denver.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: That does help. Given the diesel has risen as I believe it had this time last year, you guys ended up going for around a midyear price increase in a lot of your markets. Is anything like that in the offing this year, do you think?
Ward Nye: Todd, I think it is. Clearly, the midyear pricing that we went out with last year did give us some tailwind coming into this year. And you’ll recall last year when we came to about this time of the year, diesel was up I want to say 30% at that time as well. So as we continue to watch it march up, it is our intention to go back to a number of markets across the United States and look for midyear price increases. It’s simply time to try to share some of this. We have a lot of input issues that people simply understand, and this is a real one. And if you’re looking at first quarter, we burned 6.1 million gallons of diesel fuel. And if you look at the full year last year, we were somewhere around 28.5 million gallons. So diesel fuel is not an insignificant expense. Now energy around 12% of our cost of goods, diesel is around 8% of that 12%. So it’s not something that’s actually going to just push you to the edge, but it is something that you need to come back and address, and we do intend to do that midyear.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Excellent, and then final one for me. If we think about the Vulcan bid and the conversations that you’re having with them, you gave us an update and some timing on that. I appreciate that. I think this is one of the bigger issues that that people see around the deal. Can you talk about how that’s going relative to expectations, or is it just too soon for that?
Ward Nye: You know what, Todd, it’s probably too soon for that. I do think we’ll have resolution to that here in the not too distant future. And of course, part of what you look for is to see if you feel like you’re running into any remarkable surprises. We’ve done our homework on this. We feel like we understand it very well. And again, we’re comfortable with where we’re. I know people want an answer to that. And we want to give you that and we’re working hard on it right now.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Perfect, thanks a lot.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. Just in terms of weather obviously has been a good benefit for the past two quarters. To the best of your ability, how much do you think weather helped overall demand in the quarter? And along with that, what are you seeing now in terms of the demand; in other words, what you see now may be an indication that demand may not have been pulled forward?
Ward Nye: I tell you what, Kathryn, I’ll do this. I’ll tell you about now in August. The two months that I think are important during the course of the year, I think May is the critically important month. I think that really gives you good sense of what kind of rhythm contractors have. October is an important month too, but I’ll tell you about April and May when we get together for the Q2. Here’s what I’ll tell you though. I think weather clearly helped. When we talk, for example, about our Midwest business, and clearly you would not have doubled agricultural lime shipments but for the good weather. At the same time, that isn’t just tremendous volume. You’re going from probably 250,000 tons to 400,000 and some tons. It’s not necessarily going to move the needle. One reason that I would actually downplay to a degree what was happening with the weather is you’ve still got half of this business that’s driven by infrastructure. And most of these markets that are driven by infrastructure are going to have a fairly refined time in which you can do infrastructure work. And most DOTs are going to have that period of time from December 15 to March 15 as a point in time that really you’re not going to be able to lay, for example, spec asphalt. So that’s where your contractors are typically going to come back until mid-March under any of that. So to the extent that you’re seeing some pickup there, I think what that’s evidence of is a much stronger housing circumstance and a much stronger non-res area as well. Now keep in mind when we say much stronger, all things are relative because it’s coming back from such a remarkably low base. So do I think weather helped, Kathryn? Yes, I do. Do I think it really just changed things dramatically? Not particularly.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Great. In your prepared comments, you had some commentary about mix benefiting the quarter for certain regions. On a whole, would you say, how much was the benefit of mix versus price or price increases as a whole for the regions where you did have improvement in pricing?
Ward Nye: As a whole, I wouldn’t say it was that profound. If we looked at the Mideast, pricing was down in the Mideast. But the fact that it was down was truly driven by one project in the Mid-Atlantic that was simply a cheap sand product. We went back and looked and said if we had taken that out and had the same mix this year that we had last year, we actually would have seen pricing up a very small percentage in the Mideast. If we go to the Southeast, I don’t think mix was very remarkable there at all. To the extent that mix mattered in the West, again, it would have been simply sending some material in South Texas to a yard in particular in South Texas. But at this time of year, again, I don’t think it moved the needle that much either. So I think what you’re seeing is really more really what’s going on as opposed to simply a shell game with mix.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. I think you guys – you said that at one point in time you might have a DOJ update by the end of April. Is there any color you can pass on that today?
Ward Nye: No. Kathryn, I think what I said in my prepared remarks is really where I need to be on that, and that is we’re pleased with the progress that we’re making going through DOJ. We continue to have dialogue with them. And when we said we thought we’d have something around mid-May, it’s May 1, so we’re talking couple of weeks at this time.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay, all right. Great, thanks so much for taking my questions today.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC. Please go ahead.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: Good afternoon. I’m just following up on Kathryn’s question. You guys had issued a press release saying that – I’m just trying to make sure I got my facts right, looking for some clarification. I think you guys had stated that you were looking to get in the second half of April from the DOJ investigating staff a consent order. And barring that consent order, you wouldn’t seek to close the Vulcan transaction prior to mid-August. So are you telling us that hasn’t happened, so you’re looking to close the deal after August?
Ward Nye: I don’t think that’s what we’re saying at all. I think what we’re trying to say in the timing agreement is clearly we are working with DOJ on what I think with most of you is a very expedited basis. And I think DOJ and we continue to approach it in that fashion. And I guess what we’re saying now is we think we might be a couple of weeks later than we thought we would have been before. I think that’s really it, Bob.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: So same trajectory in terms of your original objectives.
Ward Nye: That is certainly our aim, correct.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: Got it, that’s helpful. Just switching gears from an operational standpoint, you got a big surge in sales in the West Group, and at the same time a couple million dollars of loss, minus $5 million versus minus $3 million last year. I’m trying to get through in my head the math in the sense that I recognize that it’s a tremendous sales growth number. I thought the margin would follow a little bit better due to operating leveraging in the business. Can you help me understand what’s going on there?
Ward Nye: It was really all the acquisitions and just bringing that in and really doing what we need to do to make those look like a part of our usual heritage business. So I think that’s the moving parts that you’re seeing, Bob.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: So that’s the 8 million tons and that’s the Denver and Texas impact going into 1Q?
Ward Nye: That’s exactly right.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: And just to clarify a little bit further, and let me know if I’m getting too granular. You have reverse seasonality in Denver in the sense that you’re expecting Denver to be less profitable versus the other shipments in the first quarter typically?
Ward Nye: I think that’s exactly right. Denver, unlike a lot of the rest of the United States, really had a real winter this past year, and it’s always will in the Rockies. We joked a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but we were right when we said it. If you go to the aggregate purchasing handbook, you probably don’t buy Rocky Mountain business in the middle of December, and we knew we would simply have to weather that though Q1. So you’re entirely right; it’s going to have a different trajectory there.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: That’s helpful, and just one final one, if I could sneak it in. Would it be – maybe this is for Anne. Does $125 million for SG&A spend this year sound like the right number. And is there any leverage in that going forward? Thanks for the questions.
Anne Lloyd: Yes, I think, Bob, it’s in the ballpark. The big leverage there is going to be, obviously, with the Denver acquisition, we’ve got some incremental overhead that we’ll be incurring there this year. And as we continue to synergize that business through the course of the year, get the acquisition fully integrated, we should be able to bring that down in 2013 and beyond.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: Any guess of magnitude what you can take off that? I’m just trying to figure out...
Anne Lloyd: Not at this point. We’re probably still a little premature in that regard, but we should be able to give you some color on that later this year.
Robert Wetenhall – RBC: Got it, thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, Ward.
Ward Nye: Good afternoon, Rodny.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: My first question is on pricing and the guidance for 2012. With the upward but choppy recovery that we’re starting to see by end market mix, product mix, and regional mix, does the 2% to 4% pricing guide account for all these factors, or are you more assuming an apples-to-apples comparison excluding those factors?
Ward Nye: Yes, we’ve done our best to go out and piece together what we think is going on out there, Rodny. I think we’ve tried to capture as many of those factors as we can in the 2% to 4%. Now keep in mind, the 2% to 4% does not take into account anything that we may be able to do on midyear price increases. But as you’ve heard me say before, even if you put in a midyear price increase, you only capture about a quarter of the benefit of that during the year in which it’s put in. It gives you a better bar going in to the following year. But did that answer your question on the ASPs?
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: I guess I’m where I need to be. And my second question is on the adjustments for Denver. Was the adjustment for the profit in this quarter, was that tied to the seasonal weakness, or should we be expecting going forward each quarter be adjusting the lumpiness in the Denver profits and losses by quarter?
Ward Nye: Clearly, this is going to – given the first quarter and the pure seasonality of it, I think what we’re saying is you’ve seen the toughest quarter that Denver would have. And we’re saying for this year in many respects you can just take that and carry it through. I think that’s probably what we’re saying right now, Rodny.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, all right. Thank you very much, and I’ll get back in queue.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Rodny.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Hi, guys. How are you doing?
Ward Nye: Good, Ted. How are you?
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Great. So I was hoping to come to aggregate margins, and I apologize if I’m just a little slow figuring this out. But in the last five quarters, by our account you’ve had very strong pricing. So when we look at the incrementals, and I know that there are a lot of moving variables that have influenced the last four quarters on the margin side. But they just look a lot weaker than I think we would have expected given the pricing you’ve gotten, including 1Q, where call it underlying operating margins – incrementals, excuse me, look like mid-teens. Historically, we’ve talked about normalized as call it something in the 60% range. I know you’ve talked about diesel being up 15%. You’ve talked about energy being up 18%. That’s 12% of your cost structure. But you had better pricing probably than we would have expected. Maybe others were more optimistic. And weather certainly the last couple of quarters would have been a productivity benefit. Could we just review? Is there anything that has changed? Are there issues that I’m just forgetting about that would help me understand why the incrementals have been so far below what we’d look for in this kind of environment where you’re getting some growth?
Ward Nye: Ted, I think the issues are probably twofold. And I think the issues are purely the level of volume that you’re seeing in Q1, again relatively low volumes. And I think the other is simply going back and I know it’s hard to see from where you’re sitting. It’s tied into how much we’re sending from producing locations to yards right now. In the first quarter, we simply needed to build some inventories at some of our yards. And that cost was going to be a very different number simply as we’re trying to build some inventories here in the first quarter. I can tell you that as we look at the business and we contemplate what margins and incremental margins will look like as volumes come back, we continue to be very comfortable and very committed to the types of numbers that we’ve given you and the others as well.
Anne Lloyd: And, Ted, if I could just add some more color to that, the real issue is that you’ve got, if you look at the segment information, you’ve got acquisitions buried in there. So if you think the heritage business same-on-same, so to speak, same-store sales, look at the incremental gross margins there. If you look at a couple of the impacts of energy as well as the impact of restocking the yards, which will be sales that come in the future but those costs get taken today, our incrementals are in excess of 50% on our heritage business, a little bit shy of the 60% target that we have on average, not too far out of the ballpark. Part of that is addressed by some of the supplies, repair, and maintenance costs that we’ve had to accelerate into the quarter because we did get started just a little bit earlier. I think there is just so much noise around the comparability of margins, it’s difficult to tell on the face of the financials.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: That’s very helpful. And just so I’m somewhat calibrated for the second quarter, I know you did point out that you had absorbed some excess costs in the first quarter due to better than expected production, and that’s a supply cost problem. Should we look for second quarter to have the reverse of that and a benefit on the incremental side, or is that a trend that you think is going to continue to build up for a couple quarters anyway?
Ward Nye: I think you can certainly look for a degree of benefit from that going through. I think when you do come back and you start earlier, you can simply take a look at the M&R and supply line. Our supply line was up around 19% for the first quarter, and really that’s going to explosives. It’s going to belting. It’s going to fuel. It’s going to a number of different items. And on a percentage basis, that’s a big pop. And I think as we come into Q2, you’ll certainly see the appropriate moderation there.
Anne Lloyd: Essentially Ted, your startup costs, if you think about it, you had facilities somewhat not deliver for a period of time. You’re going to have some startup costs. Those have gotten moved into the first quarter and shouldn’t repeat themselves. So we’re expecting to see that trend reverse.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, that’s really helpful. The second thing I was hoping to ask is, I know Ward made some specific comments about initiatives with the DOTs in Texas and Iowa. But if we look at the contract awards for your top ten states in the first quarter, they are down something on the order of 40%, which is not insignificant. And the last three months have been pretty bad trends for the whole industry. So it’s not just your states; there are certainly states that are worse. But I know you made some comments in your prepared remarks. But I’m just wondering if you could give us some sense of how to think about this data, just given that at least through the first quarter the awards are looking pretty bearish, for a lack of a better word.
Ward Nye: I’ll let you know a lot of that was twofold, in fact. It’s simply where people are or not on the highway bill. And I think you’re seeing a certain degree of the stimulus come out as well. Keep in mind, a very different stimulus circumstance this year. When we came into 2011, there was around 22% of stimulus that was left. When we came into this year, around 14% was left. And by our math, around 2% of it went already this year, so there is only about 12% of that left. I think you’re still seeing a lot of timing issues there, Ted. And back to my point earlier, if we take a look at really where NC DOT is and I look at their five-year work plan, they’re looking at a 2012 – 2013 work plan of $3.8 billion, a 2013 and 2014 work plan of $3.9 billion. At the same time, if we look at Texas, keep in mind they’re an August 31 fiscal year; $4.4 billion this year, $4.5 billion in 2013, and that doesn’t take into account the additional $2 billion that we identified in my prepared remarks as well. So I think you have a timing issue. I think you have highway bill issue, and I think you have the stimulus issue describing the numbers that you’re seeing. As we go back and take a look at the DOTs and where they are and what we think their spending will be, it does give us a good sense of confidence there.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: All right. That’s very helpful, guys; best of luck this quarter.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Ted.
Anne Lloyd: Thanks, Ted.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Hi, good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Ward, can you talk about the extent of cost cutting that you expect on the Denver assets, taking out of the equation any volume recovery over the next couple of years just in terms of running the business operationally, as you do at your other sites? What are your targets perhaps on a percent of sales basis or whatever you think is the right way to frame that?
Ward Nye: I think it’s probably too early be come out and give specific targets on that. Here’s what I’ll tell you, Jerry, and this is what I’m pleased with in Denver. We’ve given you an overview of really how that market is behaving right now. I think the one thing that we haven’t spoken much about is the team that we put in place. And what we have in Denver is a team, a, that has a lot of history in Denver, and b, a team that has some history with us; and we think those two things are incredibly important. And we have a business, we have a team, and we have a culture that we’re confident that’s extremely well with where we are. And we’re obviously going through a first quarter and second quarter process of integrating that business into our normal operating processes systems-wise and otherwise. So to come back and give you very specific numbers right now I think would be premature. But I’d come back and reaffirm what we said before. This is a transaction that we believe puts us in a great market. We’re excited about what we bought. We’re excited about who is with us, and we feel like that’s going to be a nicely accretive business for us as we go into 2013.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And as we take a look at the margin structure of the business today relative to your overall aggregates segment, the lower margins here, is that a function of business mix with the ready-mix business in there, or is this business at a different point in the cycle and the recovery in margins in this business in 2013, how much of that is in your mind volume versus cost measures?
Ward Nye: We know we can control costs. It’s tougher to control volume, so we’re going to go after it appropriately on the cost side. I think at the same time, if you come back and look at the numbers that I talked about earlier and you assume it’s going to be 800,000 cubic yards of ready-mix and 1.5 million tons of hot mix, that’s basically taking the hot mix exposure we had wholly before and doubling it. So we had around – I want to say 1.4 million tons last year. This is about 1.5 million that came in with this. I think at the same time, if we had gone back last year and looked at our heritage ready-mix business, it was probably somewhere around, just call it 450,000 cubic yards. So coming back with this is also a pretty big chunk. It’s different than we would have had in the past, but that’s how that Denver market is built, and that’s how you have to be structured to compete there.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And on the pricing side, very good price increases for your businesses. Can you talk about what kind of price increases you’re seeing out of ready-mix and asphalt mix customers in areas where you’re not vertically integrated? How aggressive are they being about pricing over the past couple of months?
Ward Nye: We’re clearly seeing a better trend on that. The toughest area that we had seen in trying to get price increases has been in the ready-mix community. And I think that’s a business that in part has come to the conclusion that they can no longer save themselves to prosperity, and we’re certainly looking for price increases there. We’re certainly looking for it in liquid – I’m sorry, in asphalt as well. Keep in mind, liquid asphalt itself is moving around. And as that moves, it can help other aspects of it. Probably one thing that you’d like to know, Jerry, is if we look at just liquid asphalt prices in the quarter through Q1 2012, they were ranging anywhere from call it $515 up to around $550 a ton. And that’s up year over year from something that was probably closer to the low to mid-$400s last year, and the trend continues to be anywhere from $50 to $100 a ton up. So to answer your question directly, I think ready-mix producers are clearly understanding that they need to handle their cost structure differently and we are seeing price increases there. And we are looking for them and we’re doing the same on asphalt.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Anne, is there a way to frame the range and pricing conditions like you’re seeing by region just to help us get a sense of the variability? Perhaps what portion of your business are you seeing year-over-year pricing increases versus flat to down?
Ward Nye: The best way to look at that, Jerry, is look at the different periods we have ahead of us. I’m seeing pricing up as high as low teens. I’ve seen it down as much as mid-single digit. Where it’s down mid-single digits, that tends to be one of the mix issues that we were talking about in a Mid-Atlantic state. I’m sorry; we’re getting some feedback, Jerry. Can you hear me okay?
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: I can hear you okay.
Ward Nye: Okay, did that answer your question?
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: That’s perfect, Ward, thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Hi. Thank you, good afternoon. The first question is I was just wondering if we could follow up on a previous question with respect to the M&R costs that were pulled forward into the first quarter. Is it possible to quantify how much in your view was pulled forward into 1Q and that are going to be non-recurring?
Ward Nye: You know what, Garik, if I look at M&R costs, they were up almost 10% for the quarter. So if I really look at the big buckets that had some movement, energy we talked about the fact that it was up pretty considerably. Supplies on a percentage basis were up even more than energy, and M&R was up close to 10%. So as I look at those numbers, I feel like we will certainly get some benefit of those as we move into second quarter. Clearly, as Anne indicated before, when you’re coming out of winter, when you’re starting operations earlier, what’s going to happen is you will have some startup costs that you probably would have incurred in some degree more in Q2, and we clearly had more of that in Q1.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: I guess I’m just trying to figure out the order of magnitude. Is this a couple million dollars that won’t be impacting 2Q, or is it $5 million to $10 million on this line?
Ward Nye: Garik, if you look at total production tons, they were up about 7.5% to 8%, and these costs were up in a range of 10%, 15%, 19%. You could make a pretty good case where you would expect those costs to proportionally rise. So I would argue that those pieces that are in excess of our increase in production costs are our pull-forward costs.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, thanks for that. And then I guess just to dive in a little bit more in some of these markets which you experienced negative mix, in Denver and in the Mideast, you highlighted one of the projects in the Mideast as dragging down pricing. I’m just wondering if you can provide the timeline. Are these projects supposed to be negative to pricing mix through the balance of 2012, or will they be rolling off here sooner than later so you’ll a reversal in the back half of the year?
Ward Nye: I think the issue in the Mideast rolls off actually very easily and very nicely. That was simply a sand job. When volume comes back in that much more seasonally situated business, that will be entirely muted, in my view. At the same time, what we were seeing in Denver is we were simply seeing a higher degree of base in that market compared to what we would see in most of our business. I want to say 50%-some of it was actually based in Q1, but keep in mind Q1 is not going to be a representative quarter for what goes on there. So I would take the noise around mix on those two markets, Garik, and not be particularly concerned about that going forward.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, great, and then just one more question related to the Vulcan bid. You’ve taken on about $40 million of costs associated with business development expenses. I’m just wondering how much more cost do you expect to be incurred. Do you think you’ve seen most of it at just this point? I guess is there a point if costs do continue to accelerate, then your view of the deal would change?
Ward Nye: We obviously watch that very carefully, and this is something that we feel very deeply and feel very strongly about. We’ve been clear about it. We knew it would not be an inexpensive process, and we were right on that. Here is what I would tell you with respect to the quarter though, Garik. We had a full trial. We had a full trial in Delaware. We had all the discovery that leads up to a full trial in Delaware. We had depositions, and we had a full employment act for lawyers. That’s the best way we can describe it. And I know lawyers have to eat too, but I wish they weren’t eating quite so much right now. So hopefully, we have seen the worst of that for a while. Garik, this is a deal that needs to happen. It’s a deal that I feel incredibly strongly about, as I’m sure you can tell from the financials and from what I’ve said. I feel good about what we’re trying to do. I don’t feel good about the way that we’re having to do it. The fact is these are two companies that ought to be together. We ought to be working together to do something great. We ought to be finding ways to bring two teams together and take the best of the best and have something that in every respect is world class. That’s what I want to see. I believe that’s what shareholders want to see. I don’t want to spend money this way. I don’t think it’s constructive, but we do believe in this transaction. And I know I got a little preachy on you, I apologize for that, but you can tell I feel strongly about it.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Understood, and just I’d like to sneak one more in; any update with respect to potential litigation in the other states outside of Delaware?
Ward Nye: You know what, obviously, we’re waiting for the chancellor in Delaware. There is very little activity underway in the Alabama litigation right now. There is some activity in New Jersey. There’s not an enormous amount of activity in New Jersey. The prime areas of activity that’s going on in New Jersey right now are efforts to stop us from moving forward with our independent nominees. And sadly, we anticipated that would probably be the case. But it’s the level of activity that’s going on there from a comparative basis I would tell you does not touch the process that we went through in Delaware.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Got it, thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I want to go back to the very first question that was asked regarding and where you responded with talking about all the confidence you have right now. Yet if I look at the guidance, really you went from I think 3% to 4% or 4% to 5%, and that’s pretty minimal volume guidance. So if you could just talk about given the confidence why the change in guidance wasn’t more significant also in light of what you just reported in terms of volume growth this quarter?
Ward Nye: You know what, we’ve been in a bunker here for about four or five years now. And one thing I’ll tell you, Adam, and we’ve said it before, this has never been an industry that has been particularly good at calling the turn either way. And I think one thing we like to be is we like to be incredibly clear and very transparent with people. And if we’re wrong or we’re light on it, we’ll come back and tell you about it when we get to Q2. But at the same time, I just think it’s a nice problem to have to talk about taking volume guidance up. We haven’t been there for a long time, so we like going back in that water.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: And I’m not sure how you’ll be able to talk about this question or not. But going back to the DOJ, how should investors think about the risk of value destruction associated with a forced asset sale? And what I’m most curious to hear your opinion about is the long-haul networks where quarries and sales yards might be hundreds of miles away, and where the addressable market isn’t going to be just the typical 30-mile truck ship radius where there could be a much more significant addressable market.
Ward Nye: You know what, I guess it’s a practical matter. There is probably not, in this context, a big difference between a local market and a distance market. You’ve clearly got – that’s simply the way some of these markets work. The thing that I guess I take the most comfort in with respect to it, Adam, is number one, I continue to feel confident in our analysis. Number two, we’ve taken a lot of calls and continue to hear from a lot of people who very much want to have some meaningful dialogue with us on this when we’re successful. So I think the number of buyers who are going to be there will be high. I think their level of interest will be considerable, and I don’t candidly look at the long-haul or a local market in this context remarkably differently.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure. Thank you, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc: Hey, good afternoon.
Ward Nye: Hi, Trey.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc: Just a couple of questions. One on you had mentioned a couple times single-family housing. Are you seeing – is this mostly builders coming into existing neighborhoods and putting down foundations and that kind of thing, or are you actually seeing a pickup in builders coming in, in the developing neighborhoods and laying the streets and sidewalks and that sort of thing?
Ward Nye: We are actually seeing both. Now what I’ll tell you is I think there are probably more sticks and bricks right now than there are new subdivisions going in, Trey. But at least what I’m seeing in a number of our markets is I am seeing more subdivision type work than I thought I would have. And one of the odd things is you’re seeing more of that in some instances on the higher end, which is not necessarily what you would expect. But if we’re looking at single-family permits right now, the last numbers I saw were around 23% ahead of where they were in 2011. And part of what I think is a plus side at least relative to homes is the inventory of new homes is pretty lean. Again, the last number I saw was only around 150,000 new homes were available for sale across the nation, and multi-family in that continues to take the lead. But one of the big issues that I think is simply there, Trey, is you are going to have the hangover of around 3.5 million distressed homes that are still out there. So I think you’ve got some pluses on res. You’ve got some minuses on res. What I’m encouraged though is to see the res activity in a market, for example, like Charlotte. Charlotte was a market because of its tie to the banking industry, when that industry really went through its tough times, Charlotte was in a very, very tough spot. And you heard us speak about the customer there who suddenly is bidding on five new projects in that market, and we’re seeing that repeat itself in multiple markets right now.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc: That’s encouraging news. Last question is I guess for Anne. But looking at the cost savings that you guys have identified with this potential Vulcan merger, it started off $200 million to $250 million, and it was pretty detailed what was behind that number. But I think in some of the stuff in Delaware, the number that was kicked around was $300 million or $330 million. Can you talk about what’s behind that bigger number, and is it just each of these boxes or categories are bigger, or is there something else there, if you can just give us a little clarity on that, please?
Anne Lloyd: Trey, I think our view on the synergy value is still that we’re in the $200 million – $250 million range that we originally came out with, with our proposal. We believe that that is a valid target for us to set out in this combination.
Ward Nye: Trey, the prime – and that’s the key to that. Anne said it right. It’s all around the notion of the combination. It’s not going through single buckets here or there. It’s taking a look at what SG&A looks like. It’s going through the operating efficiencies, taking a look on what can be done from a purchasing perspective. But it’s all driven by the concept of the combination.
Anne Lloyd: And we’ve always approached it in a range mentality out of those three major buckets, Trey.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc: Okay, thanks a lot and good luck.
Ward Nye: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Olin of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research: Hi.
Ward Nye: Hi, Chris.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research: With respect to that Specialty Products segment, there have been some indications from the steel industry that the integrated mills will shift toward greater natural gas consumption in order to reduce that coal component, also some focus toward iron substitute plants. I’m just wondering if that could have any impact on your volume going forward.
Ward Nye: As we’re seeing it right now, we’re not hearing or having any material discussion about that having an impact. If we’re looking at steel right now, it’s running around 79% of capacity. The fact is if it’s running anywhere near 70% of capacity, it’s going to work pretty well for us. Chris, I know you follow the steel industry pretty closely. And the last number I saw I think at the end of March, it was running at about 1.9 million tons per week, so it’s running at a pretty healthy clip right now. But we’ve certainly not had any indications from our customers that we’re looking at any degree of degradation based on the issues that you raised.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research: Okay, thank you. And then just quickly, did you break out how much of your heritage aggregate volumes are directed into the energy sector right now in terms of a percentage or anything like that?
Ward Nye: What we did talk about what we’re selling into the ChemRock and rail component. A portion of that is going to be basically what we’re using for scrubber. A different portion of it, particularly what we’re selling into the shale fields, will be under the non-res piece. But I’ll tell you, last year if we took a look at what we were selling relative to energy and shale, it would have been around 4.2 million tons. So I think you can take that and say it’s probably going to be a little bit better than that this year. It’s going to move around in the shale fields. But if you took that 4.2 million and then came back and probably added another, call it maybe a couple million tons for other power related projects and then came back and took a look at the agricultural line, that will give you a pretty good feel for portions of it.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research: So there should be no major impact from the natural gas, the cutback in drilling and places like Arkansas slowing down?
Ward Nye: What I think is going to happen is that we’ll move around. And I think that’s a fair observation, Chris, because keep in mind; given our rail construct in particular, we can hit the Marcellus. We can hit the Haynesville. We can hit Barnett. We can hit Eagle Ford. We can hit Niobrara, and we can hit the Bakken. So we have the ability to go into all of those different deposits. Now there is a migration, and you can see it, for example, in Chesapeake’s numbers. Where people are coming more quickly out of places like Haynesville and Barnett, they tend to be going into the Eagle Ford. So clearly, we have felt some degree of volume decline in a place like Arkansas because of that. There is just no...
Anne Lloyd: And we saw that last year, Chris, so we have already experienced that movement. It was that quick.
Chris Olin – Cleveland Research: Okay, great. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson: Yes, just one question on the highway bill. If we were to get a highway bill, how long would it take – a long-term highway bill, how long would it take for increased business that that would result in come and to take to get to market?
Ward Nye: You know what, if we got a highway bill, I would tell you to really feel any significant tailwind from it, you’re probably nine months or so out from that...
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson: You’ve never seen it. Is that another way to look at it?
Ward Nye: Yes, I think that’s a fair point Keith.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson: Okay, that’s all. Thank you.
Ward Nye: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne; two areas of questioning from me, first I guess directed at you, Ward. Just back for the Denver distortion there, I think you said you added 8 million tons of rock from the acquisition. What was lost in the full year from the River system? And also just to clarify, I think in the press release, it talks about the overall impact being neutral at the EBITDA level of that transaction. So presumably, we are going to see a reversal of that minus $12.5 million. Maybe I just misheard earlier, but presumably we will see a reversal of that in Q2 – Q3, just to clarify that. And then for you Anne, and maybe I misread it, but I think in the press release, it refers to reduction in the tax rate. I think it was previously estimated to be 26% this year, I think it’s now 22%. One, is that correct? And if so, what are the factors behind it? Thank you.
Ward Nye: Okay. Mike, first of all, I don’t think you miss much, so here is what I would come back and say. You’re talking about 8 million tons. Actually if you go back, I think what I’ve said is it was 8 million tons between what we did in the Texas acquisition last year and the Denver acquisition. I didn’t actually break down percentages between Denver and Texas, so that 8 million tons would have been a cumulative between those two different markets. To your point, Q2 will clearly be better than Q1. Q3 will be better than Q2 or Q1. We do anticipate really keeping about level, all things considered, by the time we’re finished Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 really on where we are in Denver right now as we finish the full year. And again, that’s simply part of the integration process.
Anne Lloyd: And that’s on the earnings line.
Ward Nye: Correct.
Anne Lloyd: Not the EBITDA line.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay. And on the River system, how much volume went with the assets that went on the River system?
Ward Nye: Yes, I want to go back and look, but I want to say the volumes on the River system were actually pretty consistent, maybe a little bit light from where we are on this 8 million tons we’ve given you. It’s a little bit below that.
Anne Lloyd: I think it was about 6 million tons.
Ward Nye: 6.5 million to 7.5 million tons.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay, thank you; and on tax?
Anne Lloyd: Yes, you read it right, 23% tax rate. That’s really we reevaluated the tax rate during this quarter that we expect for the year. The majority of that, Mike, principally relates to the impact of the transaction cost on pre-tax income and then that impact on all of the permanent deductions, principally depletion. So essentially, we’re picking up more permanent depletion.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.
Ward Nye: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Please go ahead.
Brent Thielman – DA Davidson: Thanks. My questions have been answered, good luck in the quarter.
Ward Nye: Thank you very much, Brent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Clyde Lewis of Citi. Please go ahead.
Clyde Lewis – Citi: Good afternoon, Ward and Anne; just one from me, if I may please, on the city of Millett municipality spending, it’s obviously tough to bid on state level activity, particularly in Southern Texas and North Carolina, I’m just wondering if you can maybe just put a little bit more color on the activity levels or the lower level of government at the moment.
Ward Nye: The lower level of government is doing in large part what the higher level government is doing, Clyde, and that is they’re really focused on maintenance and repair. Here is a significant difference, though, and we’re seeing this happen at local level after local level, and that is they are going forward with bond referendums. And when they’re going forward with bond referendums, the nice news is, and we’ll look at here in our backyard. We saw it in Raleigh. We saw it Durham. Statistics have shown that the bond referendums when you go forward with them, if it’s related to transportation and it’s a local issue, tend to pass around 75% of the time. That’s what we’re seeing on those. So we’re seeing good, steady, maintenance type work at the city and muni levels. Part of what I referenced in my prepared comments, of course, dealt with more snowbound areas. And they were taking what would typically be snow removal dollars, since they didn’t need to use them this year and simply putting them to maintenance and repair. And that’s why we felt like that would be incremental to our business. Is that responsive to your question, Clyde?
Clyde Lewis – Citi: Yes, that’s a bit more color. So thank you very much.
Ward Nye: All right. Clyde, thank you very much.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions at this time. And I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.
Ward Nye: I’d be remiss not to take this opportunity to thank our employees and their families who put forward remarkable effort every day to allow us to operate safely, control costs, deliver results, and execute toward strategic initiatives. With respect to those initiatives, we know you’re waiting for clarity regarding both the Delaware litigation and the DOJ regulatory review. And in that regard, May should be a busy month as we continue to pursue the business combination with Vulcan. Later today, we will release and file an updated presentation outlining our most current view of the proposed transaction, and we’ll continue to keep you updated as appropriate. There is undeniable strategic and industrial logic in the combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan. However, Vulcan seems to continue to fundamentally mischaracterize our proposal, ignore its own inflated trading multiple, and set unrealistic expectations for the relative timing and extent of their recovery. We do want a make a few points clear. Our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not cash out Vulcan shareholders. Instead, it does provide Vulcan shareholders an approximately 58% continuing ownership in a stronger entity with an immediately derisked balance sheet, meaningful dividend restoration, shared synergies through a more realistic view of near-term economic recovery, and shared upside through the economic cycle. Our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not undervalue Vulcan. Instead, it does provide a tax-free combination. And in fact, it values Vulcan at approximately 17 times its projected 2012 EBITDA. Finally, our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not exploit cyclical lows. Instead, it does underscore our belief that Vulcan’s share price given its current trading multiple already reflects expected economic recovery. Martin Marietta continues to outperform Vulcan in nearly every relevant measure. During the quarter, we had stronger aggregate pricing growth, grew net sales at a faster rate, and generated stronger absolute margins than Vulcan. We continue to operate with what we believe are industry leading SG&A levels as a percentage of the net sales and, again, set quarterly records in our Specialty Products business. It does all come down to value and we believe both Martin Marietta and Vulcan’s shareholders stand to benefit from this powerful combination. Vulcan shareholders have an opportunity to send a strong message to their Board by electing Martin Marietta’s independent nominees to the Vulcan Board and support the transaction for their shareholders. We ask you to please do so. All that said, thank you again for joining our first quarter 2012 earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. Our first quarter trends and initiatives should lead to a successful year. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results in August. Have a very pleasant day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials fourth quarter 2011 and full year conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Howard Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials’ quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’re please to share our full year and fourth quarter 2011 results. Please be advised that this discussion may include forward-looking statements in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements in this discussion are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law Martin Marietta undertakes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our fourth quarter results and to Martin Marietta’s other filings with the SEC, which can be found on the SEC’s website. Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded market expectations and the prior year as we continued to execute against our clearly articulated strategic objectives. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.52 excluding business development costs not factored into analyst expectations or approximately $0.14 greater than the market consensus and 58% greater than the prior year quarter’s adjusted earnings per share. Inclusive of the $0.20 per diluted share charge for these expenses our earnings per diluted share were $0.32. Our fourth quarter results reflect a 6% increase in the average selling price for our heritage aggregates product line. This increase cast a year where we saw steady pricing growth in each quarter and confirms our previously stated view that pricing momentum is sustainable. Moreover 2011 pricing trends validate one of our fundamental beliefs that despite depression like shipment declines over the past five years our aggregates product line has and continue to retain its ability to realize the inherent value of the in place mineral reserves. Of note, we achieved fourth quarter pricing increases in each of our reportable groups led by an almost 8% increase in our West Group. This performance reflects double digit increases in our South Texas markets driven by increasing demand for material needed in drilling and related projects in the Eagle Ford shale. There is also an element of long haul mix in this price increase. As you may recall we developed a new rail located sales yard in South Texas principally designed to meet Eagle Ford demand. The average selling price from that sales yard reflects transportation costs however; even excluding shipments from the new sales yard this market still reported a double digit price increase. Our aggregate product line pricing continues to vary by market. Nevertheless, with few exceptions nearly every market reported growth in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate our average selling price to be affected by our recent asset exchange with Lafarge North America. In that transaction we acquired operations in Denver, Colorado a truck served market with typical sales transactions completed at producing quarries. This contrast with the Mississippi river facilities we divested, which primarily represented a long haul distribution market. Accordingly, these river operations had sales prices reflecting the varying cost of transportation from a producing location to a more distant sales yard. Overall, we are forecasting pricing trends to remain steady in 2012 with the increase in our heritage aggregates product line, ranging from 2% to 4%. Pricing will continue to vary by market and increases will not be uniform throughout our business. Our operating performance continues to benefit from our Specialty Products segment, which completed a stellar year that exceeded our expectations. This business generated new fourth quarter records for both net sales and earnings. Net sales of $51.5 million represent a 16% increase over the prior year quarter reflecting growth in both the dolomitic lime and chemicals product lines. These increased sales along with effective cost management resulted in a 600 basis point improvement in this businesses gross margin over the prior year quarter despite higher energy costs. Earnings from operations for the quarter were $16.3 million in 2011 a 55% increase over the prior year quarter. Cost control remains an area of focus as evidenced by our fourth quarter results and recent restructuring activities. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter declined $4 million excluding a $1.6 million charge for non-recurring termination costs. These organizational changes should provide approximately $3 million of annual cost savings beginning this year. Including the non-recurring termination costs our SG&A expenses as the percent of net sales was 8.5%. As we always have we continue to evaluate SG&A expenses in order to further enhance our industry leading performance in this area. Fourth quarter direct product cost in our heritage aggregates product line increased 1% even after absorbing an 11% increase in non-controllable energy costs. As a reminder, diesel fuel remains the single largest component of our energy expenses and the price of diesel fuel increased 27% in the fourth quarter compared with prior year quarter and 39% when comparing the full year 2011 with 2010. Lower personnel and depreciation expenses helped offset the escalation in energy costs. Overall our cost of sales increased 9.5% reflecting higher raw material expenses as well as the higher energy prices mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we incurred $15.1 million of business development expenses, which include costs for completed transactions and the cost associated with our proposal to combine Martin Marietta with Vulcan Materials Company. As mentioned earlier, we completed an asset exchange with Lafarge North America in December. As part of the transaction we exchanged Mississippi river locations operating in a market that did not provide the best opportunity for us to achieve our desired long-term rate of return on assets. The exchange of these assets does not signal a change in strategy related to our long haul distribution network. We remain fully committed to this unparalleled network of rail and water served operations. So this exchange transaction did offer us the unique opportunity to gain a platform position in the attractive Denver, Colorado market, including both aggregates and complementary downstream businesses. The opportunity to acquire a leading position in Denver’s attractive considering it’s higher than average population growth and for capital income as well as its ability to attract both national and multi-national businesses. Further, the Colorado Department of Transportation’s recent authorization to initiate more than $2 billion of improvements to Northern Colorado transportation network should provide numerous opportunities for our newly acquired operations. We also acquired a ready mix concrete company in Denver to complement the operations acquired from Lafarge further enhancing our market position. In summary, these transactions promote a clearly stated long-term objective to have a leading position in markets with attractive growth and other key demographics, which in turn enhances shareholder value. We are pleased to welcome our new Rocky Mountain division employees to the Martin Marietta family and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our former river operation employees for years of dedicated services and I know they will be great assets to Lafarge. The other component of business development costs relates to our proposal to combine Martin Marietta with Vulcan. On December 12, we initiated an offer to issue one half of the Martin Marietta share of common stock for each outstanding share of Vulcan’s common stock. We continue to believe the combination of our company with Vulcan provides the compelling opportunity to enhance value per shareholders of both companies. We remain committed to making this transaction a reality. Our heritage aggregate shipments declined 1.2% for the quarter, similar to aggregates pricing volume variances differed significantly by market. Mid East Group reported a 6.6% increase in heritage aggregate shipments, this growth was particularly strong in the West Virginia and Indiana markets, which benefited from strong energy shipments and the rebuild Indy program respectively. Consistent with our expectations the Mid East Group reported incremental operating margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of 60% after adjusting for the volatile rise in energy cost. Volume growth in the Mid East Group contrasted the 6.4% heritage volume decline in the South East Group driven by continued weakness in the North Georgia and Alabama markets. There was a 2% decline in our heritage infrastructure end-use market versus the prior year quarter as the extension of federal highway funding through March 31, 2012 has not provided the security of long-term federal funding. However, infrastructure volumes declines varied by segment and largely correlate to the strength of state budgets and the availability of alternative funding mechanisms. Of note, transportation spending in Texas remained strong partly due to the funding from the North Texas Tollway Authority. We continue to believe that underlying demand exists for infrastructure projects once long-term federal funding is resolved growth in this end-use market should quickly follow in the mini markets in which we operate. Our heritage non-residential end-use market increased slightly from the prior year quarter. This growth was supported by our South Texas market where non-residential volume nearly doubled due to energy sector shipments to the Eagle Ford Shale. Our heritage residential end-use shipments increased 2% over the prior year quarter. And finally our heritage ChemRock/Rail end-use market declined 4%, which given the significant amount of agricultural line shipments in the prior year quarter made more challenging comparison. Our focus on cash generation allowed us to end the year with a strong cash position. Operating cash flow of $259 million and our available sources of liquidity provided the resources to invest $155 million for organic growth capital projects as well as $92 million for three acquisitions during the year. We also maintained our dividend rate of $1.60 per common share for the year. Prudent use of cash allowed us to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. At December 31, 2011 our consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.25 times in compliance with the limits under our debt covenants. A variety of factors beyond our direct control continue to make it challenging to forecast future performance. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the fact that the President continues to advocate rebuilding America’s infrastructure. We are also pleased this past Friday when the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a five year surface transportation reauthorization bill known as the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2012. This much needed legislation would provide average annual funding at a level consistent with current funding. However, we believe the bills proposed before provisions would result in more dollars being available for highway spending. While we are hopeful that the Senate will act quickly to approve a multi-year bill I would remind you that the conferencing process between the house and the senate is critical to a final bill. In our view, if this process is not successfully completed before the expiration date of the highway programs current continuing resolution it’s likely that any future action on the final bill will be delayed beyond the Presidential Election. One last note, should the conferencing process be successful and we do have a final bill or the expiration of the current continuing resolution. We would not expect the impact to be significant until 2013. Our expectation for aggregates full year volume guidance is consistent with the McGraw Hill forecast. The previously mentioned uncertainty in the timing of long-term federal funding and the veining impact of stimulus shipments are expected to lead to a slight decline in heritage infrastructure volume. We expect double digit growth in our heritage non-residential shipments driven by increased demand from the energy sector. Heritage residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate compared with 2011. Finally, we expect our heritage ChemRock/ Rail volume to be consistent with 2011. Overall, we expect heritage aggregates volume to increase from 3% to 4%. As I previously mentioned, we expect overall heritage aggregates product line pricing to increase from 2% to 4%. Our heritage aggregates direct product costs per ton is expected to decline slightly as increased production generates operating efficiencies. These expectations did not factor in significant increases in energy prices. Our SG&A expenses exclusive of the incremental expense at our new Denver operations are expected to decline slightly with benefits from our restructuring activities offsetting higher pension costs. We expect the net effect of our recently acquired Denver operations and divested river operations to be neutral to our EBITDA in 2012. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses related to the Denver operations as we integrate them into our disciplined cost structure. Earnings from our Specialty Product segment are expected to remain consistent with the record level established in 2011. We also expect interest expense to remain flat this year. Our effective tax rate is expected to approximate 26% and our capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million. This estimate includes the remaining $35 million related to the new kiln at the Woodville, Ohio operation of our Specialty Products business. We note that our expectation for 2012 assumes Martin Marietta on a standalone basis and does not give effect to the potential impact as a proposed combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials Company. This is a very exciting time for Martin Marietta. We remain focused on operating our business with the disciplined approach and delivering results enhancing long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials and the operator will now give the required instructions we would be happy to address any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Hi, good afternoon Howard, good afternoon Anne. My question relates to the 6% pricing improvement that you had in Q4. I would love to understand the factors behind it since it was higher than the effect did it include the run off of maybe some earlier lower priced highway work. And then perhaps you could expand on the sustainability in the upcoming year within the context of your 2% to 4% expectation as you highlighted.
Howard Nye: Arnie, thank you. Arnie, what we saw during the quarter is pricing moving very favorably really across our business where we saw volumes moving in a positive direction some of which we saw in South Texas related to the Eagle Ford Shale type demand pricing actually moved even better. Some of that was mix actually very little of it. Part of what I was taken by even in markets where we saw volume going down and North Texas being a good example. We actually saw volumes down in North Texas and pricing going up. So as that come back and try to assess that Arnie I think what that means is what we said in the past is broadly correct and that is we didn’t need volume to necessarily go up, we needed volume to stay relatively flat and stabilized and with stable volumes you start to see the ability to recognize the in place reserves. And I think that’s entirely what we are seeing.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Okay, my follow up question also relates to the margins in the West Group, which were noticeably weak given the positive revenue trend you have and some of the pricing trends. Can you highlight some of the specific factors that may have impacted the West Group and how we should think about that in the upcoming year?
Howard Nye: Sure, I think a couple of things Arnie. Number one, if you look at volume for the West Group that probably was down 1.4% for the year. So we continue to see volume going down. I think that’s one of the issues that we just recognized across the enterprise and that is you are really working a lot of fixed cost against a very low volume. I think even more of moment related to the West is really what’s happening with energy. If you look year-on-year there are, I want to say $19.2 million of energy costs that were in there around 9.2 of that tied directly to the cost of liquid. Keep in mind that’s one of the few places that we actually have hot mix in our heritage snapshot. If you go by and you call that $19.2 million out what you will see is on a normalized basis we were probably looking at incremental margins around 80%. So I think if you really pull energy out of it, it looks much more like what you could ordinarily expect. The other thing that I would remind you is we did have more long haul in the West this year. We added the new sales yard in Millet and we are also looking at a new yard in Kansas City. So I think between long haul and energy that addresses most of the issues to last.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Hi.
Howard Nye: Hey, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Well given the (Inaudible) certainly seems like there is more of a disconnect now than previously has been between your heritage market and your consolidated for a total that we are trying to sort out for this year. You’ve got to help in bridge out or understand how your guidance on volumes for 3% to 4% heritage growth translates to how we should think about sort of the total company’s extent now?
Howard Nye: Here is what I would suggest to you I think we are going to put something out on our website when we are done today that will give you a sense of how heritage really looks going forward. I think that should help you considerably in your modeling Todd at the same time what I would suggest is coming back and looking at the acquisition activity here is directionally what I would offer to you. Assumed that on the stone side there is going to be about 8 million tons of stone that’s added from the acquisitions that we did last year now keep in mind the acquisitions were in the Western United States so as you are putting 8 million tons in assume the types of pricing that you come to see in the West. The other thing I would encourage you to do is go back and put in around 800,000 cubic yards of ready mix and around 1.5 million tons of hot mix. I think if you adjust your models to take into account what we are going to recap for use heritage and then you put that degree of stone in, plus that degree of ready mix and as well that should get you where you need to be Todd.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: That’s perfect. And then same sort of the concept thinking about price last year in the river district. How much of a given that that was most of the long haul I would assume that made the average price in that region. How much of it do you have a way for us to understand how much that sort of used the price in that region if it did?
Howard Nye: What I would tell you to do is look at that broadly along corporate averages up and down that river. I think that’s probably your safest way to look at but I think again if you do it that way what you will see is it will have a downward optical view on pricing. Simply puts pricing in the West tends to be lower.
Anne Lloyd: And Todd what we will do is recap the last five years obviously with the river movement in discontinued ops history essentially gets recapped at the same time. And we will put out on the website also some volume and pricing trends that show you that differential.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: That would be great. Thanks. In the residential end market can you tell us what that was for the full year 2011 versus year-on-year?
Howard Nye: The rent market for us full year we did see, well we are seeing this year going to the year Todd to give you a sense of ’12 first as we are seeing that up 10% to 14% year-on-year. I think as we looked at res for the full year it was slightly up but I want to say it was in the single digits. There we are clearly seeing more activity as we move into ’12.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Got it. On the Woodville expansion you mentioned that $35 million of spending there. Is that generally on pace with the comments you made before.
Howard Nye: Yeah, it is. In fact from everything we can tell that project is in entirely moving along the way that we have expected to from an on time, on cost and otherwise.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Then final question on the Vulcan deal. And as part of your state desire to get the Vulcan board to come back to the table. I think the last update we had was on January I think hence that that has not happened yet can you, is there any update on that that you could give us?
Howard Nye: Alright, you know I think this is the third time I have spoken roughly since we announced our transaction or proposed transaction on December 12. And on December 12, I put a call into Birmingham and send a Birmingham and sent an email to Birmingham. And obviously we would very much like to engage in the dialogue as we sit here today we are still looking for that dialogue.
Todd Vencil – Sterne Agee: Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak from BB&T. Your line is open.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Could you guys tell us your ready mix, yards and your hot mix, tons for 2011 full year?
Howard Nye: You know, what if you are looking at hot mix for us for the full year, Jack, what I would tell you is you are probably looking at around 1.4 million tons of hot mix and ready mix probably around 0.5 million cubic yards.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Okay, and with regard to housing, which were obviously coming off of low base and there is something’s that look better as we sit here today with regard to some activities starts and permits I guess multi-family. But are you guys seeing home builders start new subdivisions, which obviously also uses a lot of aggregate in terms of site development or we still putting out to some existing lots?
Howard Nye: Jack, I think the answer is yes. I think we are still putting housing on existing lots but we are now seeing some new subdivision work now granted it’s not a lot but it is some activity now. And over the last couple of years there has really been no activity in that. And you nailed it and that is when you start seeing activity where it’s a new subdivision we will truly be a leading indicator when that starts taking off I’m not saying it’s taking off but I’m saying there is activity Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Howard, do you think if we got a highway bill and you said that even if happened by the end of March it probably wouldn’t affect your business till 2013 and I appreciate the lag there. But the market was down last year I think (Inaudible) is forecasting another down year this year, which is probably a good place to be without a highway bill I would say. But it was a high, getting a highway bill at a flat rate of funding strangely enough, enough to boost the market beyond, above where it’s been you know slightly down.
Howard Nye: I think if you had a highway bill that was out there in multiyear I think the answer is yes and probably would Jack. Because in our view what’s happening right now is states are simply unwilling to commit to multi-year projects and they are not willing to go forward under that basis. So I think even if we had something that was flat and obviously we would much rather see a higher bill number yet I think that’s still helpful. Now frankly, you’ve been coming back and looking at what the house has proposed to address that for a second when you really look at what that bill has done to get rid of old redundant programs or what it’s doing to give states unlimited authority to toll in the state highways and basically putting a faster delivery time out there. Now, I clearly do believe that a new bill would start to add the volume now granted. Even when we go back and take a look at the way stimulus worked I think you can look at the stimulus program and use that as a bit of a guide on what’s going to happen when we end up with new high way bill. And as you recall when stimulus came out you only saw around 21% of it go in 2009 and not surprisingly 2010 was a pretty big year when 43% of it went and again 2011 it’s 22% feeling a lot like 2009 as did lot of things in this industry this year as in 14% next year so not a bad blueprint to use in the back of the mind as you think about a new highway bill.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital: Yeah, okay. Great, thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jack.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Hi, good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hello Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Well towards the Specialty Products business can you talk about the timing of the kiln start up we will get any production contribution this year?
Howard Nye: No I wish we were but we are anticipating is having that done really at year end Jerry. So we will look to have incremental tonnage as we go into ’13 that’s going to be let’s call it 275 thousand times.
Anne Lloyd: Hey Jerry, we’ve indicated that it’s probably around $22 million to $25 million that would step up in 2013.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Perfect. And in terms of your outlook and for flat Specialty Products earnings next year despite very favorable natural gas price. Any sort of headwinds that you should be thinking about or you leaving yourself somewhere in the case natural gas prices come back or steel get softer?
Howard Nye: No, I’m sorry when steel is running at 75% like it did this year it works really well. Keep in mind nat gas doesn’t matter a lot to that business nat gas probably 27%, electricity is around 27% and coal is around 26%, 27% so you really got a covey of energy items that can affect that business. Nat gas being down helps a lot but steel running anywhere north of 70 is really the single biggest driver right now.
Anne Lloyd: And that is the issue Jerry in our forward view on natural gas is that particularly the United States is going to be pretty stable so it’s going to be steel utilization. And we are assuming that utilization runs about like it did this year, which is where you see the profitability because the business essentially is at capacity.
Howard Nye: Nice problem.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And can you talk about the CapEx versus volume guidance stripping out the Specialty Product capacity expansion. It looks like you are actually cutting core CapEx by I don’t know what you call it 13 or so percent versus some pretty nice volume growth. Is there a difference in capital intensity between the asset swap or any other factors that are driving that?
Howard Nye: Not particularly if you go back and look at what I would tell you some growth projects this year there is probably somewhere around $63 million to $65 million. We usually have around $25 million in land that’s usually a good solid place over. And if you come back and really break it down on mobile, plant and other it’s probably around $67 million. And again that’s clearly a rate below DD&A now that’s running around $174 million a year. But Jerry I think we can continue to do that when we are running at these types of volumes and keep in mind if you look at our CapEx profile and compare it to most in the sector we were investing in ourselves when others were trying to buy businesses at big EBITDAs and big multiples. So we feel like pulling back CapEx the way that we have right now is a) responsible but b) we believe we can do it and importantly do it safely.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And can you quantify the G&A opportunity you see in Denver perhaps elsewhere that current facilities are operating that and hopefully what time period do you think you can get them down to level that you see across your business.
Howard Nye: You know what the operations are up and down to truck range and that’s clearly a business now we’ve had under belt now for about a month and a half. So we are going to need a little bit more time with that Jerry before I give you any more specifics on it.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi Trey.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: First off on the pricing guidance of 2% to 4% so coming off of the 6% and some of the other things in the quarter and some of the other things you’ve talked about you anticipate the year kind of looking at 2012 do you anticipate the year is going to be more kind of front end loaded as it relates to pricing or more kind of even or how do you, how do you look on it think about that given the strength that you are coming off of 4Q.
Howard Nye: You know what I wouldn’t necessarily think of it as just front end loaded. I think as we do watch some stimulus projects come out that clearly does help that. But at the same time I don’t see that I see it really being fairly uniform traits around the year. That’s how we would approach it.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Okay, secondly Anne on the business development expenses in the quarter can you give us kind of your expectation for additional expenses as we kind of go into first quarter and beyond.
Anne Lloyd: Obviously, we expect to incur some expenses the magnitude of that will depend on how long we continue to process. So we will have to tell you that when the quarter ends.
Howard Nye: Yeah, Trey, a couple of things to keep in mind. We do have a trial that’s coming up at the end of February and in early March and as you look at the charges that went in there for last year, some of that were very discrete fees that were paid specifically to the bankers and their fees going forward are more success driven. But with that said we are not going to start a process that we are not prepared to finish. We don’t think spending that type of money is best use of our money or best use of Vulcan’s money and obviously we very much want to sit down in a room and have a meaningful dialogue. But I think right now it’s hard to come back and really put a nail on what those costs will be.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Okay I understand that. Okay, and then last one again it’s for Anne on the gain on the discontinued operations in the quarter could you give us some color on what all of that consisted our fleet?
Anne Lloyd: The biggest issues there and you had a write off of your asset and it’s from the river business then you got new assets from Lafarge and then you wrote off about $10 million of net goodwill that you had to recognize there and it ended up being $10 million gain on that sale.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: $10 million pretax gain okay. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Yes, you are seeing a tax effective numbers on the base of the financial statements.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Inc.: Right got you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi Howard and Anne.
Howard Nye: Hi, Rodny.
Anne Lloyd: Hi, Rodny.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks for the update on federal transportation spending. You had mentioned a hypothetical long-term bill back in the first half of ’12 will benefit ’12 results. Should we generally anticipate a nine month lag between the finalized bill and a trickle down to aggregate demand?
Howard Nye: You know what Rodny, that’s probably not a bad way to think about it. Obviously you can certainly have seasonality to be built into that naturally anyway. But I wouldn’t persuade you from looking at it in that way.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And with the likely mix shift from asphalt to more concrete intensive projects, can you give out an estimate of aggregate demand for 1 billion of repaving activity versus a billion for road widening and extending?
Howard Nye: You know what, if you are building new roads, Rodny, it’s around 32,000 tons per lane mile when you are building a brand new road.
Anne Lloyd: It’s regardless really of.
Howard Nye: Yeah, that’s from the ground up. Obviously aggregate is, it’s more aggregate intensive in asphalt than in concrete if you are looking at something in the mid 90s versus something in the mid 80s related to concrete. I’m not sure you would see a remarkable shift more to concrete I suppose to asphalt under any circumstances and clearly right now where you have more repaving you will obviously see more asphalt right now. But at the same time now there are differences in cost as well and state DOT is pretty sensitive to that. So I’m not sure we will see a remarkable shift but I hope that help remind your question a little bit.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yeah, you are talking about the shift in your demand or the shift in growth expanding activities versus repaving?
Howard Nye: You know what I’m not sure that it would change our demand outlook very much Rodny and that’s what I’m focused on right now.
Anne Lloyd: If you would have perhaps a better cash flow impact if you add new construction. It might not change demand it might change the nature of the demand we are just going to use front based products clean stone a little bit more in the road construction I suppose to just clean stone in the asphalt resurfacing.
Howard Nye: Primary thing we would do Rodny we would do is come back and address inventories in a very productive way and it would let us run our plants in a more wide open fashion right now, which is not where we have been to for quite a while.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Understood. And with the asset side can you remind me how many times we’ve gained in Denver and how many times we have divested along the Mississippi?
Howard Nye: As I said, I think if you go and take a look at what the aggregate tonnage acquired over the last part of the year would be going into the New Year it’s going to be worth around 8 million tons. I think what you will see going out at river it’s probably going to be somewhere close to 7, 7.5.
Anne Lloyd: Yeah, Rodny you will see that in page 14 of the disclosures in the press release. You will see the divested tonnage we break those out for you.
Rodny Nacier – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you guys.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Rodny.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: You and the checks on your guidance for next year you talk about the energy that’s precisely necessarily South Texas business you referred to earlier in the call.
Howard Nye: You know what South Texas is clearly a big heap of it if you look at what the energy business and in that term right now what shale meant to us in 2011. We had around 4.2 million tons of material that went to shale all by itself and to give you a sense of what we saw in South Texas that we went back and looked at Eagle Ford in 2010 it was somewhere just shy of 0.5 million ton this past year somewhere just over 1 million tons. And as where you look at what we do like it’s going to be going into 2012 that deposit all by itself we think it’s going to be around 1.7. But we also see activity in the Barnett and the Haynesville, some in the Marcella, some even up into the Bakken. So when we talk about energy shale is the big piece of that. The other piece that we believe more of as we go into ’12 then we saw in ’11 will be in wind farms as well. Keep in mind we’ve got nice presence obviously in Texas and Iowa and those are awfully big on the wind farm producing side as well.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: So if we added all up what is energy as we end the year as a percentage of your tonnage, your total tonnage?
Howard Nye: If we looked at that if we said that the shale was around 4.8 million tons and we came back and said maybe the balance of it might be another couple or more right now you can go back and do your math on that but you probably wouldn’t be far off on that.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: Alright, thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is open.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. May be just wanted another limited questions we can ask about essential transaction. But with that said, what steps can you discuss from an operational stand point can you say to pave the way for potential combination with Martin and Vulcan. But in that regard, are you doing anything differently now that you can discuss?
Howard Nye: The primary thing that we are doing with our business Kathryn is we operate it with safety first and cost right behind that. And we are focused on absolutely positively running as efficiently as we can because we have a business that we are proud of it in this respect, you come through as you did in’11 watching volumes down, watching energy up and still putting up numbers that I think we are very proud out and then I believe our shareholders are proud of. Our primary focus is making sure that we do that and we do it even better in ’12 and we are obviously in a view we can do even better than that with a broader footprint. But our primary operating focus right now is keeping our eye on Martin Marietta.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Okay, keep in mind we’ve gotten some few facts on basically the materials and building products company they benefited from milder weather in the fourth quarter particularly in December and November and that is carried into the year. To what extent do volumes help out at all in Q4 and what are the potential benefits just going into the New Year?
Howard Nye: Part of what it did is it did let us put some inventories in the ground in some parts of the country that we needed to in the fourth quarter, where often times you wouldn’t be able to. If you looked at volume trends through the fourth quarter volume is actually down in October, down in November and actually up in December. So that very much ties with what you saw Kathryn. It also tended to be relatively dry in some parts of the country as well that was helpful. I think one of the big deltas that we saw in Q4 this year as compared to Q4 last year we still had a good agg line season but agg line volumes this year was still around 17% lighter than they were last year. I think one thing that people shouldn’t be fooled by when you have this nice warm weather in parts of the country don’t feel that you, there is a lot of D&T work that’s going on. Keep in mind, if you go to the standard state of North Carolina is a great example. When you got to mid November the standard specification that you basically say you have a time extension on any contracts that you have with DOT through March 15 next year. So what you have is the usual remarkable demobilization of construction equipment on jobs. So even if you’ve got a week or 10 days of very nice weather contractors typically will not bring their people back from lay off, they will not demobilize their equipment, they won’t put them on the job because it’s just not a very efficient way to run. So I think there might be one or two halts Kathryn that this warmer weather will help but in large part those are anomalies not the rule right now.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Now on the other non-res side of construction Anne as you commented earlier about residential (Inaudible) family but what is a greater driver right now of the residential multi-family or a traditional single family housing. What also I think you get some color in terms of years that you know what inning we are in terms of this multi-family build out.
Howard Nye: And what right now what I would tell you is there is more multi-family activity than there is single family activity although there are areas that we are seeing increasing single family activity. With respect to, that’s a great question on where we are at the game so I guess we are, we just finished Super Bowl so we are talking baseball terms. Yeah, Kathryn I would tell you, we are somewhere in the middle of the game right now on that. Clearly, housing still has uptime still ahead of it until people can sell homes or get financing they are not going to build new homes and I would say, we are probably looking at five year period of time to really see that turn in some respect. And that’s where it sits, you are going to see more multi-family activity during that snapshot than you will on the single family activity side.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Great on your CapEx can you give some commentary on contribution with the mobile equipment as meaning kind of continue bouncing on the bottom. Are you taking any difference approach on either how you utilize equipment or how you kind of outsourcing equipment for instance with fixed rental versus outright purchase or any different strategies today that you would have taken five or six years ago with managing mobile equipment.
Howard Nye: The primary thing that’s different on mobile equipment is a) you are not putting as much hours on all of it and the beautiful thing is, it is mobile so you do you have the ability to move it from operations that may not be as good to other happens that have the need. So simply making your mobile equipment mobile and feeling free to move it between districts between divisions or otherwise it’s an important piece of it. I don’t think the lease analysis or the purchase analysis as for say change I just think the need is changed.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Okay, and finally and just a quick clarification on SG&A have you assuming flat year-over-year on a percentage basis in percentage of sales or on the dollars?
Anne Lloyd: It will be on a dollar basis for the heritage basis.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: For the heritage business? Okay, great. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Thank you. I was curious with your South East region given the river divestitures with the impact there be changed with the operating margin or would it just be a lower dollar contribution to the overall company margin.
Howard Nye: You know what you won’t see that much of a difference in the South East in large part because the volume there has just been in many respect God if you really think about what that South East is for us right now it’s North Georgia where I think in many respects we were searching for bottom throughout the year. I hope we found it on volume. Alabama has been a very difficult market as well. Hardly enough the one market that we saw actually very steady march improvement on volumes throughout the year was actually Florida and we are actually start increased pricing in Florida throughout the year. But the balance of the markets in the South East are just at a point that the company fixed costs around 90% of what you got there right now I mean Adam I’m sorry.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: And my second question goes back to the earlier dialogue about on the highway bill, pretend we’ve got waved your magic wand you got a $15 billion six year bill how much do you think it will get back to you, how much of it circle down to an annual basis.
Howard Nye: Well that’s a nice thing to sit back.
Anne Lloyd: It’s been a while since we’ve had that kind of debate.
Howard Nye: You know what if you go.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: I will pick you another, I will pick a different number.
Howard Nye: But I mean if you go to a fully robust bill and you assume there is good solid transportation activity what I will do is take you back to a 2006 timeframe where you had good infrastructure activity, you had good commercial activity, not great but good. You had really red hot housing activity and pretty steady ChemRock and rail activity. I think if you are more normalized that you are probably into 185, 190ish volumes based on what would have been a heritage snapshot here in our rear view mirror, I think that’s probably not a bad way to look at it.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Levin from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: Hey good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Scott.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: I was keen the residential breakdown question definitely I think you said that your multi-family activity was higher than what you are seeing in single family side. If we think about normal times, what if that split tends to look at over very, very long period of time. If you get a sense of how below trends we are in the single family side right now.
Howard Nye: You can put it ordinarily you would see a much bigger component than single family than multi particularly in South East and South West. I mean right now if you take a look at the types of numbers that are out there I mean you are almost seeing something based on the pure history that we’ve seen, something that’s been three times on multi-family, the res write down I think that’s almost an inverse.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: Got it and then not to beat Howard exactly.
Howard Nye: I will go at it.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: It sounds like you really think if you don’t get one by the time the current extension expires don’t bank on it. Is there a realistic possibility maybe we get extended once in your view to the, one of the summer holidays to buy a little bit more time before throwing in the towel on this. If we don’t see anything by the end of March we just not expect anything or are you not expecting anything you know at that point for the rest of the year?
Howard Nye: I will tell you Scott others may disagree with me on this I guess my sense is that if we don’t have it by the time the first ER expires Presidential politics aren’t just so powerful for the rest of the year. I think in perhaps any other year than this maybe you can see what you are describing. But I think it’s the house and the senate can get it all together here over the next call at 45ish days. Realistically we are probably looking to see our year and as a practical matter that’s where we thought we would be. I mean if you go back and listen to these calls for the last couple of years, we’ve been pretty consistent saying that we thought we would probably not see any multi-year highway bill until after the election. I hope I’m wrong but I think that’s probably where we are.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: Got it. Maybe one follow up on that you know from the point at which we got initial proposal out of the house, which again was down 30% plus. Are you encouraged by what you are seeing out of the hill and you know what surprised you pleasantly or would that be overstating things.
Howard Nye: No, I don’t think that’s overstating things. I think that’s fair and actually the different correlations who have looked at expedition spending and have really good advocates for it have a lot to do with that. I mean if you look at the dialogue that’s coming out right now, there is good dialogue coming out of the White House, there is more better dialog coming out of the house. And the senate has been very consistent on it, look at where the senate is it came out of committee with a high policy 18 to zero vote. So we like the time of dialogue, we like the fact that we are not hearing any of that 30% cut language anymore. So I think as we look at where we sit and what we are likely to get would we like higher numbers, sure we would. Are we at least pleased that it looks like it’s staying flat? We are and are we particularly pleased with the reform provisions that we see out of the house? We are. So I don’t think your notion of feeling better about it is misplaced at all I would agree with you.
Scott Levin – JP Morgan: Understood. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Thank you. I just have a clarification question on your placing guidance. Howard you stated in your prepared remarks that you expected pricing to be steady in 2012 if I heard you correctly just want to reconcile that with the 2% to 4% guidance. The steady commentary respect of the pricing mix was a result of the other slots and gains in the last quarter.
Howard Nye: I think what we are more saying to that we finished this year with pricing up 2.7%. So when we were saying steady we meant we should continue to see that same level of trajectory. So perhaps I needed to retain my words a little bit more and I’m sorry about that Garik but that’s what I meant to say.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, so thanks for clarifying that. And just switching gears to non-res you talked about your expected growth with some of the energy markets. Can you talk about what you are seeing on the lighter side of the equation of this retail if you are expecting any volume pick up in those areas?
Howard Nye: You know what Garik we are expecting some pick up in those areas this year. We started seeing some pick up in that last year and again it’s not tremendous uptick and I think as we discussed before that you should see us going to follow residential is something that feels like a nine to 18 month lag. So on some of those places where we are starting to see some residential activity I think we will see some office and retail more of what we’ve seen so far. There is people coming in and finishing office and retail projects that were started several years ago and then they walked away from it and put it on ice.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, and then a question just on the (Inaudible) volume performance in the quarter. Was the year-over-year drop was largely related to the decline that you mentioned ChemRock in 4Q.
Howard Nye: Yeah, it was. We saw the ChemRock/Rail piece yes I think will sit down and down 17% and we saw some of the rail business down as well.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: So if you hold that out would you gotten across the volumes to grow the Western Group.
Howard Nye: Yeah, I think you would have seen something positive considerably much better.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay and then just lastly to the degree you can answer this. Can you provide an update with respect to the DOJ chase I can request and perhaps what we made expected ruling from them.
Howard Nye: You know I probably can’t give you anything on their timing what I can tell you is we did follow (Inaudible) obviously the week that we initiated our offer. We have worked as we typically do at DOJ our practice has been to work very openly, very collaboratively with them and we feel like working in that type of a process leads to a quicker more thoughtful conclusion. And that’s exactly where we are we haven’t been surprised by anything and we continue to feel very good about the process.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Hey guys how are you doing?
Howard Nye: Alright Ted, how are you?
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Great, quick questions and you’ve been kind enough to kind of bridge the cost of sales if you will for the aggregate business for us in prior quarters. And so if we could do that in the fourth quarter and really where we are going just trying to bridge on a reported basis revenue up $21 million and as we think about, we think your current profit is down about 5.5 in the back half of one time, which is 26% decremented. I know that Howard has highlighted $19 million of higher energy cost. But I’m just wondering if he could help us reconcile pricing with the $16 million tail wind or something there kind of how you get through pricing, volume, labor, energy et cetera.
Anne Lloyd: If you look at the fourth quarter on consolidated basis growth profit you are right pricing was up about $17 million. Volume and energy cost you about $3.5 million each and the other big driver was your inventory change that cost you about $7.8 million.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay.
Anne Lloyd: And it’s on the growth profit line.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, gross.
Anne Lloyd: Yeah.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, and then can we do the same thing for the Specialty Product business because 82% incremental is very impressive. I couldn’t tell if Howard might have mentioned before that energy was not benefited I guess that kind of control for it the press used to say the one to help. Maybe you can just help us bridge kind of what happened in the fourth quarter especially products that will be great too.
Anne Lloyd: I don’t have that bridge we typically don’t provide that level of detail. Energy natural gas was not, it was essentially neutral in the quarter. The biggest energy issue at mag or Specialty Products is the (Inaudible) that they have to use call there but demand was up, pricing was up, but typically we did not provided that level of detail on a bridge Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, could you get an order of magnitude of what pricing did for Specialty Products or is that nothing you want to disclose?
Howard Nye: You know what Ted, Ted that is something that we don’t want to disclose at this time.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Well, I just wanted to ask you on the vision on Specialty Product as they assume they basically add capacity at this point.
Howard Nye: Yeah. I think that’s a very fair assumption.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay, so just trying to reconcile flat profits next year, I assume you’ve got a meaningful degree of pricing power would you get natural gas curve is not going to be a headwind for you. Trying to understand how we should think about flat profit guidance for that segment given those dynamics and as it one of those where we should anticipate shifted revenue for some reason or if you could just elaborate there it would be great.
Anne Lloyd: It’s all back to the field utilization Ted. I mean we are using field utilization for ’12 as the same as it was in ’11, which is what current indications are. If that number, if utilization is higher, you can expect higher profitability, if it’s lower you can expect lower profitability again that’s against the 2011 benchmark.
Howard Nye: So again, keep in mind Ted watch it the way it goes around 70 if it goes above 70 it does really well but if it’s below that or near it suffer.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Is there any pricing assumption positive pricing assumption built into that guidance flat kind of pretax contribution.
Howard Nye: We received our normal price increases in that segment. But again we don’t come back and address on the percentage basis what that is.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Got it, okay. Got it, thanks a lot guys let’s rock this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks Ted.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Your line is open.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: Hi, thanks for the terrific color. You’ve done a great job of managing SG&A. I was just curious how much of an opportunity is there moving forward especially at times like you might be growing your revenue base. Can we keep that at the 125 range or is there any chance you have additional cost saving opportunities.
Howard Nye: Guess what we are always going to look for additional cost saving opportunities. We will leave it at that. So we continue to look at it I do think we manage SG&A better than the most in the sector and we are obviously very proud of it but at the same time 25% of your cost of goods sold is on the personnel line and that’s always going to be something in a volume challenged time. That we are going to be sensitive too again I’m proud of that and our team should be proud of that that in type of an atmosphere they can put up these type of numbers and in large part it’s great to have 6% pricing in the quarter, I won’t deny that but if you don’t have your cost profile in place none of the rest of it matters.
Anne Lloyd: And Bob we do have some pension headwind in 2012 that we are going to have to overcome obviously asset returns were not very good for 2011. So that pension increased for 12 and it’s about $9 million and about third of that goes to SG&A.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: That’s really helpful color. On the diesel cost are you guys hedging and what are diesel prices since the start of the year on average.
Howard Nye: Well you know we don’t hedge these so what I could give you a sense of when we finish the fourth quarter diesel was around $2.95 a gallon that was up 27% from the prior year quarter when he said 2.32 for the full year. And this number is very similar to fourth quarter; it’s $2.96 per gallon, so there is your 40% delta year-on-year. If you are looking for what you meant for the quarter it’s about $0.05 of share that’s diluted for the full year of $0.23 and if you are looking for total usage in Q4 it was just shy of 7 million gallons and for the full year just shy of 30 million gallons.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: That’s fine.
Howard Nye: That’s probably more than you ever wanted to know.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: No and that’s great that’s exactly what I was trying to figure out. And just in terms of your offer to combine with VMC. I was trying to get to understand better how you give out the proxy process. Because one thing VMC has been saying is that even if you’ve been able to get your nominees on the board you would have 5 out of 12 on VMC’s Board of Directors. So if that mean if you did get that then you would wait around the fall year when you get the full board on your side. Am I thinking about that correctly?
Howard Nye: I mean, I think if you are looking at a pure process I think you are thinking about it correctly and I think one of the things that we said in one of the last calls is we are not looking to start something, we are not prepared to finish. Again the process that you outlined is not the process that we want to do. I mean what we want to do is we want to sit down with them and we want to negotiate with this current management team with that current board and find a way to bring these companies together in a very productive way that gained some media shareholder value. But through your question from a process perspective if that doesn’t occur then I don’t discrete I think you hit it.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: And you’ve prepared then to wait the extra year is what you are saying.
Howard Nye: We are prepared to do what we need to do.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC Capital: Thanks very much. Nice quarter.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Brent Thielman – D.A. Davidson: Hey, Howard; hey, Anna. Just a quick question on the South East Group. Howard you mentioned for this ongoing weakness in North Georgia and Alabama markets and obviously the diesel is having to have a broad impact. But we should say those areas that principally would keep you from getting the profitability in that group or it’s a little more Q&A.
Howard Nye: I would say that, that is very much if you look at housing and his landing in particular it is just frankly it’s almost non-existent as is commercial work there. Georgia DOT has been through its own political imaginations here over the last several years as well. It looks like a lot of that is going to get so forth dealt with the ballet bill issue that’s going to be up there in July as we go into this year. But clearly the underlying economies in North Georgia, Alabama and to a degree but not as too much in South Georgia has been the primary drivers no doubt about it.
Anne Lloyd: And Brent we are at a point at some of those litigations where either you are open or you are closed. And so if you are open you are running at probably above 80%, 85% fixed cost. It’s just a tough climate.
Brent Thielman – D.A. Davidson: Okay, great. Well thanks for all the color in the call.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Brent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Yes, good afternoon. Just one question I guess it’s two parts for me if I could 1% increase in direct product cost 9.5% in cost of goods sold I mean these are all the detail I think three months ago two part question if I could maybe on first of the 305 in Q4 how much of that is defined into direct production cost and the second part of the question as we go into 2012 you talked about still declining direct product cost. What is that you need to close that gap you didn’t know around where will be the fuel prices. I mean obviously I’m talking with volumes roughly the same talking about 3% to 4% increase. But it’s the major difference that it caused by energy or am I missing something there? Thank you.
Howard Nye: No, you are not missing anything there. Anne will come back and address the first part of it. But from where we sit to answer your question directly one it’s something that you’ve (Inaudible) that’s your number one driver and then two coming back and having some degree of stability or normal seat related to the energy component in mind.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Thank you and Anne.
Anne Lloyd: I will get right now.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Well maybe I just add one more to Howard then have you expanded the asphalt that situation more of a concern. I mean significant types of that on the asphalt side.
Howard Nye: You know what I think what that’s going to asphalt typically is either going to made or otherwise depending on how the liquid is moving. I think what’s going to happen next year is you will go into the year recognize that you’ve gotten much more stable situation in liquid. You know keep in mind even when I address that $19.2 million delta in the West Group that we talked about on energy full 9 plus of that is simply related to liquid. So as you go back you have indexing in the contracts and you have the ability to capturing those issues moving to New Year. As I don’t see that being as volatile in ’12 as it was in ’11. Simply press the energy spike and the liquid spike it was so remarkable during the course of the year.
Anne Lloyd: And my total cost of goods sold for the quarter about two thirds of that are direct.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Thank you both.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Johnson from Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Well good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hey, Keith.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first of all on the guidance for interest I think you guys said flat in 2012 versus 2011. It looks like in your call sort of brought down into this $13 million range after the first quarter this year. Do you expect maybe a little pick up a little bit in 2012?
Anne Lloyd: Well we had a little pick up in debt because of the cash payment that we’ve made for our acquisition that we did in the fourth quarter. And obviously we’ve got perhaps a little bit of (Inaudible) to fund the cost of project here.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Okay and then if we look at the fourth quarter taxes I guess, of course dropped off a little bit. But that’s all swap related and what happened fourth quarter on the income tax line.
Anne Lloyd: Fourth quarter taxes are very strange discontinued ops happened but it’s really, but it’s been biggest driver for the fourth quarter was continuing now. And that has to do with the fact that your business development expenses were not deductable.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Okay, now it’s just play out quarter-to-quarter.
Anne Lloyd: That just pay out as with the resolution that our business development activity.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: But otherwise, just running into 26% annual rate.
Anne Lloyd: That otherwise without this three other unusual advantages.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Okay, I apologize if I missed it earlier. For 2011 can you tell me what the infrastructure heritage volume and then the non-res heritage volume as they were related to 2010?
Howard Nye: If we looked at infrastructure for the quarter was down 1.7. Non-res was up slightly. ChemRock/Rail was off around 4.5 and res was up around 2.5. If you looked at it for a full year infrastructure down around a little bit more than 5, non-res of around 3.5, ChemRock/Rail off around 1.7 and res up around 3.7.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: And then I guess just final question you’ve mentioned about the seasonality short of shifting with this asset swap. Because the portion of your business is now more to the West is that, should we just think about that particularly on the West segment as we kind of bottomed out first quarter and going forward with more of a presence in the Denver operation.
Howard Nye: Absolutely you should I mean it’s going to be. It is the winner operation and introduce some of our friends to the notion of when to (Inaudible) and that large part of that’s what you are doing with the winner operation in Colorado you are a winner in that and give you a sense that if you simply look at it from a headcount perspective. The operations that went out to the operations that we brought it our net headcount is stuck around 463 people. And again if you are back to the notion that’s the most expensive cost that you have is the personal component of it and you are entirely right I’m back and look at that with very much with winner focus here during the balance of Q1.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: And my final question is that any portion of that fourth quarter drop off in the West in the gross margin lines because of the swap happened and that’s the fact during extension.
Howard Nye: No, I mean to the extent of that was there we just, a little bit of invoice nothing above that.
Keith Johnson – Morgan Keegan: Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Alright, thank you.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Howard Nye for brief closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Again, thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. 2011 was a notable year from a lot of perspectives. We think the stage is set for a very exciting 2012. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2012 results in May and updating you as appropriate on our strategic initiatives. Thank you. Thank you, very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta Materials’ Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Nye, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials’ Quarterly Earnings Call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’re please to share out third quarter results and trust this discussion will be helpful to you. Third quarter earnings per diluted share surpassed market expectations. Excluding the $0.04 per diluted share impact from a nonrecurring early retirement benefit, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.11. This performance is supported by our company’s disciplined business approach, resulting in aggregates product line price growth for the third consecutive quarter. Additionally, our Specialty Products segment has set a new quarterly record for net sales, as well as a new third quarter record for earnings from operations. The continued successful execution of our financial and operational strategies, which includes the prudent use of capital for attractive acquisitions and sustained dividends, has allowed us to outperform others in our industry and enhance long-term shareholder value. We have previously stated our view that pricing increases reported during the year would be sustainable. Confirming that, we continued our pricing momentum despite a 2.2% decline in our heritage aggregates product line shipments. Lead by our Southeast group, we achieved pricing improvement in each of our aggregates segments, with an overall increase of 2.8% in our heritage aggregates product line. Importantly, the majority of our geographic markets experiencing volume declines still reported pricing increases. Cost control has always been an essential to our solid financial performance. Commitment to this objective is evident in our controllable production costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. We reduced third quarter direct production costs in our heritage aggregates product line, specifically lower personnel, repairs and depreciation expenses allowed us to absorb a 16% increase in noncontrollable energy costs. Diesel fuel remains the single largest component of our noncontrollable energy expenses. For the quarter, we paid an average of $3 per gallon, which represents a 46% increase over the prior-year comparable period. Overall, this increase in the price of diesel fuel reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per diluted share. Diesel also indirectly impacted costs for transportation and raw materials. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $2.3 million, inclusive of a nonrecurring $2.8 million charge for an early retirement benefit. After adjusting for this nonrecurring charge, SG&A costs for the quarter were 6.6% of our net sales, an industry-leading performance. Moreover, despite this nonrecurring charge, our 2011 year-to-date SG&A expense compares favorably with 2010. Our Specialty Products business continues to perform exceptionally, driven in part by a steel utilization rate that has remained above 70% for much of the year. Net sales of $50.4 million were 19% higher than the prior-year quarter, representing a new quarterly record. This sales growth directly led to a new third quarter record earnings from operations of $15.6 million, a 240-basis point expansion of this business’s operating margin excluding freight and delivery revenues. Based on these strong operating results, we are again upwardly revising our full year earnings guidance for this business. We continue to deploy capital prudently to enhance long-term shareholder value. As part of this objective, we evaluate business development opportunities with the goal of establishing or maintaining a leading market position in areas with attractive growth demographics. To illustrate, recently, we announced an asset exchange agreement with Lafarge. Under the terms of the agreement, we’ll acquire significant aggregate sites, vertically integrated hot mix asphalt and ready mix concrete plants and a road paving business in and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. This transaction provides an opportunity to expand our geographic footprint in an attractive market with compelling long-term growth prospects driven by a per capita income above the national average. We expect to complete this transaction during the fourth quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, we invested $94 million of capital, primarily from maintenance initiatives. We also invested and targeted organic growth projects including the new dolomitic lime kiln project at our Specialty Products business in Woodville, Ohio. This $53 million kiln project should be substantially complete by the end of 2012. Our ability to distinguish ourselves from others in the industry is also seen through our sustained dividend payout to shareholders. While many competitors have significantly reduced or suspended dividends to preserve capital, we’ve maintained our payout rate throughout this prolonged economic downturn without sacrificing our balance sheet strength, financial flexibility or capital deployment opportunities. At September 30, 2011, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.07 times, in compliance with our limit of 3.5 times. As mentioned earlier, our heritage aggregate shipments declined 2.2% for the quarter. Recently, Congress extended federal highway funding through March 31, 2012. However, the absence of long-term federal funding has shifted state spending toward maintenance and other shorter-term projects that tend to be less aggregate-intensive. Further, the current macroeconomic environment has increased the dependence of infrastructure construction spending on the strength of state budgets and the existence of alternative funding mechanisms. As a result, our infrastructure shipments declined 3% for the quarter. We are encouraged, though, by the significant amount of federal-highway funds obligated in September, which coincides with the end of the federal government’s fiscal year. This reinforces our belief that strong, underlying demand exists for infrastructure projects and once long-term federal funding is resolved, growth and this end use will quickly follow in the markets in which we operate. Aggregate shipments to the commercial component of the nonresidential construction market, namely office and retail, increased over the prior-year quarter, most notably in our West Group. Specifically, construction near local military bases resulted in a 65% increase in office and retail construction shipments in our San Antonio district. However, this growth was offset by a reduction in energy sector shipments, which have been constrained by low natural gas prices and reduced shipments to the nuclear power and wind energy components of the sector. Cumulatively, our quarterly nonresidential shipments declined slightly versus the prior year. Our residential end-use shipments increased 9%, while ChemRock/Rail market was unchanged, each compared with the prior-year quarter. A variety of factors beyond our direct control make it challenging to forecast future performance. We continue monitoring activity in Washington, D.C. and are pleased to see increased dialogue regarding the need for a multi-year surface transportation bill as part of jobs creation. The President’s jobs speech in September to a Joint Session of Congress provided a catalyst for action, as both major political parties recognized the job generative power of infrastructure investment as well as it’s important to overall economic growth, public safety and general welfare. On November 9, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing on proposed two-year, reauthorization bill. However, given the national deficit and the continued sensitivity to all government spending, the issue of long-term federal infrastructure funding is far from resolved. This ongoing issue, along with the shift to more maintenance-level work, has required us to revise our outlook for infrastructure shipments. We now expect this end-use market to be down in the mid-single digit range for the year. We anticipate the trends in nonresidential shipments to continue with improvement in the commercial component being offset by a reduction in some portions of the energy sector. Overall, we expect a slight decline in the nonresidential market. Our residential shipments should increase comparably to the rate of improvement in 2010, and finally our ChemRock/Rail shipments are expected to be down slightly from 2010. Giving consideration to the dry weather and the strong agricultural lime shipments in the fourth quarter of 2010, we now expect our aggregate shipments for the full year 2011 to range from down 2% to down 4%. We believe our pricing momentum is sustainable and reaffirm our previous guidance for our aggregates product line. Again, we expect average selling price to range from an increase of 2% to an increase of 4%. We expect direct production costs for the aggregates product line to decline for the full year. However, lower production in response to decreasing shipments and the duration and magnitude of higher energy costs are expected to result in a higher overall production cost per ton for the year. As stated earlier, we are increasing our earnings guidance for our Specialty Products segment. This business is now expected to contribute approximately $60 million in pre-tax earnings. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses should be less than 2010, even after absorbing the impact of the nonrecurring early retiring benefit, primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense should be approximately $60 million. Our effective tax rate should approximate 26%. And we continue to forecast full year capital expenditures at $155 million. We believe our operating performance and prudent use of capital have distinguished Martin Marietta from other building materials companies. We’ll continue to pursue and execute our strategic objectives with the consistent goal of increasing long-term shareholder value. We thank you for your interest in our company. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we’d be happy to address any questions that you may have.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Hi, good afternoon, Ward. Good afternoon, Anne.
Howard Nye: How you doing, Arnie?
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: My question relates to some of the geographic differences within your business. If you looking at the various areas, Mideast and Southeast were down, yet West showed a very sharp improvement in both revenue and profitability. You mentioned the San Antonio office market as creating one of the positives in West, but could you expand a little bit on the trends you’re seeing in the West and how they may differ from the other regions?
Howard Nye: Sure. Happy to do that, Arnie. First of all, just looking at how the quarter played out, including the West Group, we saw volumes in July down around 2%, August down around 3.2%, and frankly there’s an Irene effect probably in that volume piece up that the West would not have felt. And in September, volumes down about 1.3%. You rack it all up and you do end up with what you indicated; volume for the West Group up 3.7%, for the Southeast down 12.7% and for the Mideast 3.9%. I’ll work my way to the West, but I’ll really focus on the Southeast for a second. That’s a market that we had indicated last year, particularly in North Georgia and Alabama, and frankly parts of the river, that we’re still looking for bottom. As we look at really what we had seen, for example, in North Georgia, in this context, Atlanta, volumes there were down nearly 23% and as we look at river volumes, there we’re down around 17%. What you need to do, Arnie, is take that and juxtapose it to what we’ve seen in the West. In the West, volumes were up in Iowa around 4%, volumes were up in the Southwest as well, meaning that whole San Antonio, Houston, South Texas area. So as we come back and even look at the Western district, volumes were broadly flat or the district within the West Group. What that did to us, Arnie, is exactly what we thought it would and that is we saw incremental sales in the West Group of around $13 million. So as we come back and look at the incremental sales of $13 million at least the heritage aggregates group, then we come back and see incremental gross profit in that group of about $8.4 million. And that brings us back to something that we have said that you would see as volumes continue to move forward and that is the incremental operating margin performance. And what we saw in that West Group to answer your question very specifically was around a 65% incremental margin simply on the heritage aggregates piece of it. Now going back to the portion of your question on what’s going on in some of the individual markets, in what we’re seeing there in particular, we mentioned San Antonio and the fact that the military presence in San Antonio is driving some degree of residential as well as commercial. What we’re also seeing in parts of North Texas is a remarkably strong infrastructure market as well. Keep in mind, Texas has $4 billion plus worth of lettings this year. So if we look at the major projects in the metroplex, and really there are about seven or eight of them there; the DFW Connector, which we have significant tonnage on; State Highway 161, significant tonnage; Interstate Highway 635, which is also known as the LBJ, with significant tonnage. All of those are projects that we’ve had a very significant role in this year, as well as some projects simply with the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or the DART system. So what we’re seeing in the West, at least in Texas, is good infrastructure work, growing work in the commercial sector and better residential work than we’re seeing in most parts of the country. And then even when we go to the Midwest, several things are pretty profound there. The farming economy has had a very good year this year, which means if we have a dry winter, we may well have a good ag lime season again in that market. And at the same time, we’re looking at remarkable flooding that had occurred in much of the Midwest. The Missouri River came out of its banks and stayed there for a very long time this year. And some of the repairs that will come from that are going now. More of the repairs from that will go as we go into 2012. But I think those are probably some of the snapshots that help differentiate at least why we’re seeing volumes up in the West, at least compared to what you see in the Southeast Group and the Mideast Group.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: That’s a very thorough answer. I thank you. One very specific question about when you do transfer your properties. I know you have fed the Texas market from places like Kentucky along the river, the Three River and other facilities have supplied the Texas market. Do you see any impact when you do in fact get rid of your river properties, will you be able to supply the market from other sources?
Howard Nye: I think – keep in mind, Arnie, we have the most extensive rail network in the country. So between what we’re doing offshore and what we can do on our rail network, and specifically in the West, we’re the largest shipper BN, UP and Kansas City Southern. So I don’t think we’ll have any difficulties continuing whatever market presence that we’ve had in those markets going forward.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Arnie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak from BB&T.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Thanks. Good afternoon, Ward.
Howard Nye: Hi, Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Hi. Wanted to ask about SG&A. You went into some detail in your commentary about it, but it’s down year-on-year versus for the first nine months. So as you look to 2012, do you guys think there are further gains to be had with lower SG&A? Or is there more of a variable component, depends on how the earnings go in 2012 so that could swing it? Can you talk a little bit about what opportunity might be there for further reduction?
Howard Nye: I think the two things, Jack, that we continue to always have on our radar in order are safety and costs. And realistically, what we’re going to be able to do in some respects is we can reshuffle some of the reporting lines. As you know, from our 8-K and from my commentary, we did have an early retirement here, and as a consequence of that, we will move around some reporting lines in the business and we will obviously watch that as volumes go as well. So we have certainly demonstrated, I think, the ability to flex our costs very effectively, and depending on our outlook for 2012, we will continue to do so.
Anne Lloyd: Jack, this is Anne. One of the wild cards will be performance of the assets in our pension plan, which through yesterday were doing okay and then I think today may change that direction a little bit. But that could cause a change in the pension costs. I mean, but again, too soon to tell that. We’ll see how it sets out for the balance of the year.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Okay. On the subject of residential, your volume was up 9% in the quarter. I know we’re bumping along the bottom and at a very low level of absolute residential activity, but up is up nevertheless. What’s happening there, if anything new, that you’re sensing? Or is it just a couple of pockets of activity and no real change?
Howard Nye: I don’t see dramatic change in that, and again, in part of the commentary that we offered, Jack, we talked about areas where we do have a military presence. And what’s interesting to me, typically when we say that, you’re going to think about North Carolina and Texas. And that’s not a bad place to fall to. But literally, what we’ve seen around Camp Lejeune; what we’ve seen at Cherry Point; what we’ve seen at Fort Stewart in Georgia; what we’ve seen at Wright-Patterson Airport, that Air Force base up in Greene County, Ohio; and what we’ve seen in Texas have really been the leaders in that. Now in fairness, much of that’s going to multi-family in some respects, but still in those discrete areas, we’ve seen more single-family building I think than others might have expected as we came into year. That’s also pushed the downstream as well into commercial and I think that’s exactly what we saw and what I referenced in San Antonio. And again, we’ve seen that in more areas than just San Antonio. It was just more pronounced there.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: I see. Okay. And with regard to weather – that was a factor in your second quarter. How about in the third quarter? Either any spillover effects from the flooding or anything direct in the third quarter that you sense? I know you didn’t really mention it but...
Howard Nye: Right. I mentioned it briefly in my response to Arnie Ursaner a minute ago because I think we did have at least in North Carolina and parts of Virgin a bit of an Irene effect when it came through in August. So I think when we look at the August volumes showing down 3.2%, I think it’s fair to say there’s some component of that. I think the other weather piece of it that is more broadly misunderstood than I would have thought is the extensive flooding that did occur up and down the Missouri River and that stayed in that part of the country for a significant period of time. Cities like Omaha have been dealing with almost biblical and historic flooding literally for months. And I think what that’s going to mean, Jack, is in some instances, you’re going see some stone go out the door because it’s dealing with mayhem. I think probably more significantly you have interstate highways, roads and infrastructure simply that has been underwater for an extended period of time. I think that’s probably slowed traditional maintenance projects on some of those projects this year. I think at the same time, what that will dictate as far as use next year is probably going to be enhanced. So I would point you to flooding in the Midwest.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Yeah, okay. Makes sense. Thanks very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jack.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne.
Howard Nye: Hello, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: In your prepared remarks, or in the press release I should say, you spoke about West Group benefiting last year from higher farmer application rates and then you talk about how this application rate season is going in that – in the region broadly. And then talk around out of the clear reporting regions, which ones do you think has the highest potential to deliver out volume growth in the fourth quarter here?
Howard Nye: Sure. Jerry, I’m having a little bit of trouble hearing you, but I think the essence of your question is you’re looking at volume growth in the fourth quarter compared to prior year. And I think the biggest issue that we did have last is what we saw in ChemRock/Rail and ag lime in the western United States. We had a remarkably cold Q4 last year, but we had a remarkably dry Q4 last year. And what I’ll tell you is we’ll take cold, but we really need dry. And what I’ll tell you as well is our teams in the Midwest have said if weather cooperates, we can be in a position for a very robust agricultural lime year again this year. Keep in mind we said that last year. Part of the comments that I probably made at this same time last year is if there was any single area of our business that had pent-up demand, it was likely in the agricultural lime sector and that’s exactly what we saw because we had literally missed about three seasons prior to that because of wet weather. I would tell you that that demand is still there, so if we have good, dry weather into the fourth quarter, I think what we have in the Midwest can perform actually very well. As you know in this industry as well, October tends to be one of the more significant months of the year. Obviously, I can’t go into where we are in October right now, but October and May are two months that you do tend to watch. To the extent that we can continue to have dry weather in the Southeast, that construction season can be considerably enhanced. So the two areas that I would encourage you to watch, we feel like Texas is going to be what Texas is going to be – but the areas that can really have a swing will be in our Midwest, in Iowa and in Nebraska and in the Carolinas at this point in time, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And that’s helpful context. And sorry for the bad connection. Can you talk about the price increases that you’re seeing in the marketplace for the downstream businesses? Can you talk about what kind of pricing you’re getting in concrete and asphalt mix? And also are you seeing your customers in areas where most of your areas were not really integrated. Are they getting price increases that are comparable to what you’re getting in aggregates?
Howard Nye: All right. I’ll tell you what, I’ll deal with the pure aggregates side of it first, then I’ll come back and talk about what we’re seeing on the vertically-integrated component of it. If we look at what we’re seeing just wholly across the aggregates group, so as I said in my prepared remarks, if I go across our different districts and look at them, what I’ll tell you is the vast majority of them are showing pricing up for the year. There are some areas showing pricing up for the year, at least through the nine months, in double digits as well and a number of those in areas that are showing volumes down at times in double digits. So I think that’s notable. If we look at what’s going on in asphalt, in particular, coming back to your question on the downstream products, we are seeing moderate increases in asphalt. But that needs to happen because we’ve certainly seen liquid asphalt move pretty considerably. If you take a look at where liquid was in say last year or even the quarter before, in Q3 2010, liquid was around $457 a ton and in this quarter liquid around $550 a ton. So moving some of that into the price of asphalt makes a lot of sense. The biggest component that I think people have struggled with has simply been the frequency with which the pricing has moved in that. It’s been hard to keep up with. So for example in our business, Jerry, if I looked at asphalt for us last year at about this time, we had sold somewhere north of 800,000 tons. If I look at it this year, we sold over 1.1 million tons. So clearly, volume is up but between the pure price of liquid going up and having to buy more of it, the cost basically to liquid to us in asphalt are up 65% this year. So again, we’ve seen some upward pricing in that but there’s usually a lag in that, Jerry, and that’s clearly what you’re seeing now. I think the area that continues to have the most difficulty on pricing, and it’s not a surprise, is in ready mix pieces of the business. Keep in mind, we only have ready mix in very discrete areas right now, in San Antonia and in portions of Arkansas. And we have seen largely flat to down pricing in ready mix this year. And I think that’s broadly consistent with what most markets are seeing.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: Thank you. Just a little longer-term question. The Southeast, it’s struggled for a while now. What needs to happen to get this get back to a solidly profitable area? I mean besides its volume, is there any structural changes you need to make? Just whatever your long-term view is there would be helpful.
Howard Nye: You know what, Keith, I think the biggest single issue that the Southeast is struggling with is simply volume right now. I think if you look at a market like Atlanta for us, I think I mentioned in my comments that North Georgia volume was down 23%. Actually pricing was up in the mid-single digits in North Georgia. So that tells me really you’re at a point that it’s more driven by volume than anything else. So I think when that market sees volume come back, I think it’s going to take off very nicely. I don’t see structure in a Georgia or a South Carolina or parts of Alabama being particularly problematic there as well. I think one thing that is worth noting in my comments relative to the Southeast as well is we’re seeing two things in Florida and I think it’s notable. Number one, pricing was up in Florida again for quarter, so that’s starting to have a very nice trend. And actually for us, volumes were also up in Florida, granted only around 4%, but still volumes up in Florida is something that we’ll certainly look at.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: Is the volume you’re speaking of recovery, is it more on the non-highway side?
Howard Nye: No I’d – well, I think it varies considerably. For example, in South Georgia, you’re seeing a lot of port activity, so I think that’s entirely what you’re seeing there. In North Georgia, it’s primarily going to be driven by what’s either happening, or probably more to the point right now, not happening in infrastructure. I think one thing that’s going to be worth watching and when you go to it and really wonder what are the things that will have to happen over the long-term to try to make things better in a state like Georgia, I think it’s going to be worth watching what happens next July in Georgia. Georgia has the sales tax initiative that’s called the Transportation Investment Act. And what they’re looking to do in Georgia is they’ve broken the state up into 12 very distinct districts, or as they call them, 12 special tax districts. And what they’re looking to do on each district is simply have a vote, and they’re looking to vote in a 1% sales tax. If that 1% sales tax is voted in, Georgia could be in a position to raise around $1.5 billion a year for investment into their infrastructure program. So if you’re looking at their 10-year plan, and that’s what they’re looking at, that’s around $19 billion. So if we’re back to a place like Atlanta, Georgia, that’s considerably off on volumes, and then suddenly you’ve got a 10-year plan that if voted in could put $19 billion there, I think that could translate to volumes. But, Keith, I do think that is the issue...
Anne Lloyd: And Keith, we would expect you to vote yes for that.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: They’re not even publicizing that yet. So we’ll deal with that next year, I guess.
Anne Lloyd: Get ready.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust: Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rodney Niche from KeyBanc Capital.
Rodney Niche – KeyBanc Capital: Hi, Ward. Hi, Anne.
Howard Nye: Hello, Rodney.
Anne Lloyd: Hi, Rodney.
Rodney Niche – KeyBanc Capital: I have some questions on the Specialty business.
Howard Nye: Sure.
Rodney Niche – KeyBanc Capital: The business had another good quarter and I was curious if you could perhaps provide some color on if the growth was more tied to volume? Or price? Or a combination of both?
Howard Nye: You know what, that is just a great, solid business right now. Let’s begin with this proposition, Rodney. If steel is running better than 70%, that business is going to work pretty well, at least a big chunk of it. For much of this quarter, it was running somewhere between 72% and 76%. So what I would say is use that as your baseline and then you should have a pretty good sense of what’s going to drive it. So steel was healthy and we continue to see inventories not at remarkably-high levels, so we feel like the steel companies have managed that actually very well. And we think that portends well for our business. The other side of it that continues to move along at a very attractive rate is what’s going on in the chemicals piece of it as well. And particularly, what we see in our slurry business, that’s been particularly strong. And in the summer months, in fairness, you would expect it to be strong. So I wouldn’t suggest to you that we’ve seen any particular strengths there. I think one thing that that business does do exceptionally well is it’s not just that they’re good in managing their business and their sales and their production, they’re very good at managing their cost profile as well. And we’ve indicated that time and time again on these conference calls. I think we have one of the best management teams running that piece of our business that we have anywhere in our entire enterprise. I think the business is working well and the management team is doing an exceptional job.
Rodney Niche – KeyBanc Capital: Okay. And I know that business exports on big shipments as well. Was an international demand driving any demand as well?
Howard Nye: Yeah, there’s certainly an international demand there, but by and large, you can look at what’s going on domestically for that business and that’s what’s going to really dictate the way it performs. And that’s certainly what happened in this quarter, Rodney.
Rodney Niche – KeyBanc Capital: All right. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Yes. Thank you very much. I had two or three questions, if I could, Ward. In fact, three brief ones. Firstly, the aggregate lime, I mean I think that that total account was about 6% of end use in the full year last year, but is it much more important in the fourth quarter? And can you give me some indication of the percentage? Then one for Anne on the tax rate. I mean I think it was 23%, Anne, for nine months. You’re indicating 26% for the year, which seems a pretty high rate in Q4 given the lack of profitability normally in Q4. Am I missing something there? And then another one maybe for you, Ward. The consolidated costs, as you described them, were up 6.9% in the quarter, up from 1.6% I think in Q2. You list some of the factors there. Which were the particularly significant ones? And I guess more importantly, are a number of those costs now going to start to come down during Q4 because I would think that sort of the base rose a bit, didn’t it, during Q4 last year? Thank you.
Howard Nye: Real quick, Mike, I’m going to work backwards and I’m going to confess, Anne and I are both looking at each other because I’m not sure we understood or heard your first question. I’m going to work my way from the third one forward and then come back and ask you to repeat your first one. I think on the consolidated cost side of it, Mike, the only issue that’s out there that I think really put duress on us is what we saw, and frankly what everyone would have seen on the energy side of it. As we look at labor, labor was down. As we look at maintenance and repair, M&R was down. And I think that’s particularly notable. And I think we can continue to do that and I think that’s something that we’re doing that most cannot. And I think there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be under duress on maintenance and repair costs because they’ve not invested in their CapEx over the last several years the way that we have. So as I look at going into next year, I think we’ll continue to control labor exceptionally well. I think you’ll see nice, steady improvement on M&R. Clearly what we’ve seen on DD&A has stayed steady. Actually it’s coming down, as you would imagine. The one area that this year has been extremely challenging is what we’ve seen on energy. Keep in mind, when we came into the year at the very beginning, we thought energy would be up 25%, 30%. That’s where we thought it would be coming into Q1. And clearly, it’s been considerably ahead of it all the way through. I think if we look at a forward curve on diesel right now, candidly, I don’t see a significant change on where we think that’s going to be. Now the corollary to that is I think seeing that type of input cost on energy can be helpful in some components of pricing and can be helpful in some components of the way our quarries operate in truck markets as well. So I think we have to look at it that way. But from a cost perspective, Mike, that’s the only area that I would really draw your attention to. Is that responsive to that question?
Mike Betts – Jefferies: It is. Just as a follow-up, on the base in Q4 2010, presumably those energy costs were already rising in Q4 2010. So is it an easier slightly – it’s a higher base so therefore an easier comparison?
Howard Nye: You know what, it may get moderately easy, but I’m not – keep in mind, much of what’s going to be happening in Q4 happens in the early part of Q4, not in the later part of Q4. So if there’s moderation the latter part of the quarter, it doesn’t so much give you an easier compare.
Anne Lloyd: Well and, Mike, we paid about on average $2.32 a gallon the fourth quarter of last year. So if you get it up to $3, you’re still going to carry some of that burden. You might not have the same consumption.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Anne Lloyd: From a tax perspective, Mike, the third quarter was disproportionately low due to the positive effect of a settlement of the 2008 audit from the IRS. So we expect the 26% rate to average out for the year. So it wasn’t that the fourth quarter’s going to be disproportionately high, it’s that the third quarter was disproportionately low.
Mike Betts – Jefferies: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just to clarify my first question. Really it was to get an indication of the size of the aggregates lime business in Q4 of last year, Q4 ‘10, because when I look at the overall proportion of your sales by end market in the whole year of 2010 agricultural, chemical and industrial was 6% of sales. So but by the sound of it, the agriculture element is a much bigger element in Q4. I’m just trying to get some indication of how big it is.
Howard Nye: You know what, I mean it can be up a few hundred thousand tons on the ag lime piece of it. But as a practical matter, Mike, it’s not going to move the percentages around in (Inaudible).
Anne Lloyd: But the total consumption for our ChemRock/Rail business was around 11% last year. So it’s greater than our residential exposure. What the real driver on agricultural lime it is a premium-priced product. So it has a – while it may not have the effect on tonnage, it can disproportionately affect the profitability.
Howard Nye: Oh, right. Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. The first is on volume. Given the mid-range of your fiscal ‘11 volume guidance, would imply a low-single digit year-over-year increase for Q4. You’re facing some pretty tough comps for Q4 of last year when volumes were up in the mid-teens. What gives you confidence that you could potentially see an increase in volumes in Q4? And maybe any clarification on the trends you’ve seen throughout the quarter, and as we go into obviously as we are into Q4 today?
Howard Nye: Sure, Kathryn. Kathryn, we obviously just – we look at every one of our businesses from the quarry up. And literally, as we march through it and we do our forecasting, it’s a quarry-by-quarry, district-by-district, division-by-division snapshot. So that’s simply based on what we’re seeing out there ahead of us, real-time, right now. Much of it, candidly as you know, weather-dependant. So as we go into Q4, that’s something that we have to have there in front of us and in front of you. But I think with the exception of that, it’s simply knowing what we have ahead of us that has given us the confidence to say that that’s where we’ll be.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: So in other words, the world isn’t falling apart like the headlines might lead us to believe?
Howard Nye: No, and we’re not in Greece either, so we can all feel a little bit better about that. But no, we certainly don’t see an implosion on aggregate volume at all, Kathryn.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Okay. And then in terms of pricing, was there any material change at the end of the quarter versus intra-quarter?
Howard Nye: No, not particularly. Pricing story this year has absolutely unfolded almost precisely the way that we thought it would and it’s been an interesting year because the biggest surprise that I’ve had is that some people have been surprised with the way pricing has behaved. I think what we said was once we found some degree of stability, it didn’t have to be up, it just didn’t have to be remarkably down anymore from a volume perspective. We thought we would start to see very sensible pricing growth come back to this business. And that’s exactly what we’ve seen. So I haven’t seen anything in the second half of the year that to your question, Kathryn, I would say is notable. It’s just moved along at a very consistent, very steady, in my view, very predictable pace.
Anne Lloyd: Well, Kathryn, we have, obviously as we talked about in the second quarter, seen some mid-year price increases, so we have gotten a little bit of pick-up from that. So you’ll see, really kind of – I know you like to look at it sequentially, you’ll see pricing overall improve as you move sequentially. So that probably is the most notable difference.
Howard Nye: But, Kathryn, I would come back and say to you as well, bake more of that into next year than you do this year anyway.
Anne Lloyd: Yes.
Howard Nye: What that really does is it simply raises the bar on what pricing will look like as we go into 2012.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Sure. And then my final question is you touched a little bit earlier today about capital expenditures. What sort of increase in volumes in your key markets would you need to see in order to bump up CapEx more meaningfully? And could you clarify what type of spending would need to be expended with that initial increase in volume? So what would be the bigger buckets in other words?
Howard Nye: You know what, if I look at what we’ve done so far this year, $93 million this year versus I want to say around $135 million, $139 million last year at the same time; if we look at the way that’s worked, around $74 million of that has been in buildings equipment and land improvements. And really if you come back, around 90% of that has really been what is in equipment all by itself. What I would always point you too is haul trucks, loaders and crushers are going to be the areas that from a maintenance perspective will take most of the punishment in what we do. So I would come back and say look at that specific componentry. I think what you saw last year, and I think this is responsive to your question, we did see an uptick in volume last year, particularly in a district like Arkansas that had a lot of activity in the Haynesville shale last year. So we did run into I want to say $3 million or $4 million worth of additional CapEx that was required as that volume popped in some ways that I think in many respects surprised people. A pleasant surprise, but albeit still to a degree of surprise. I think you can see snapshots of that type of CapEx on occasion if volume comes through. But I think it’s also going to be in those very specific areas that I just went through with you, Kathryn. I think the trick is how are you doing on keeping those areas well financed right now. And that’s one reason I’m happy to come back and say as I look at say $73 million that we put into buildings equipment, land improvements, et cetera, and 90% of it’s in equipment, we think we’re in pretty good shape there.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Okay. And actually just one final question before we head out is just is more broadly looking into 2012 understanding that you haven’t give guidance yet. But if you look today, how is your sentiment or feeling looking to 2012 today versus say where you were before as we were – really when you reported earnings last quarter, you were right in the middle of the whole debt ceiling issue in the U.S. How are you feeling about your world and planning for the future today versus early August?
Howard Nye: You know what, I guess I feel better today than I did then and I guess several reasons. One, I did like what I saw in September. I mean the obligations that went out in September were the second-highest we’ve ever seen in September. So I think that gives us a nice push as we move into next year. In particular, keep in mind the obligations in September really don’t do that much for us this year anyway, so it was over $10 billion. I think the bigger piece of it as we come back, Kathryn, and you know this better than most, it really depends on where you are. And I think having that tailwind from the fed certainly helps. I think as I come back and look at DOTs and look at their budgets and look at their plans and I see a DOT like North Carolina that’s got a budget next year that’s going up 4.6%. But if you look at it on a 10-year basis, the next year, it’s going up somewhere between 9% and 10%. The year after that, it’s planned to go up almost 3.5%. Those are big numbers in a state that matters disproportionally to us. And at the same time, when we come back to a state like Texas and a significant position for us, and we go back to FY 2009, I mean they had lettings in Texas in 2009 of $2.5 billion. This year, almost $4.9 billion; next year, almost $4.5 billion. Really the only delta being about what we’ve seen in stimulus that’s going to be going away next year. But as I come back and look at those major projects in North Texas that we have rolled in, and frankly, look at a market like San Antonio where we’ve gone in and augmented what was already a very nice market position there, if I look at where we are in North Carolina, I like it and I like the DOT budget. If I look at where we are in Texas, I like it. And I like what’s going on with DOT and I like what’s going on downstream as well. So I think we can hit a number of different buckets. And frankly, I like what at least I’m hearing out of D.C. If you and I were talking about what federal spending was going to look like back in August or before that, the primary thing we probably would have been focused on is what we were hearing out of Mr. Mica and the House when they were talking about a 30% cut, and I don’t think we’re hearing any of that type of talk now. So I think from the federal side, I feel better. I think from the state budget perspectives on what I’m seeing as far as tax revenues and otherwise, I feel pretty good. And I like what I see in the bidding schedules going forward.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Thanks, guys. I was hoping to come back to the margin question, and I was hoping Anne might be able to provide somewhat of a bridge between the costs, headwinds and tailwinds. And I get specifically, just back of the envelope math, if your pricing was up 2.4%, that would equate to about $0.25 per ton. So pricing would be something like a $9.5 million tailwind to your profitability. I know you said that diesel costs were up $0.08, that’s $5.5 million of headwind. But could you just kind of bridge all the other kind of puts and takes? I know you said liquid asphalt, freight costs, repair and maintenance was a benefit, depreciation was a benefit. But just if you could just bridge us, that would be great.
Anne Lloyd: If you look at – just step back and let’s look at the consolidated incremental margin and if you can allow me to break it down. If you look at just what I’ll call the heritage aggregates product line, which is rocks only, we had incremental sales there of about $3 million and actually had a loss in that line. That was all energy, primarily diesel, which we measure. Now there’s the indirect cost of the freight, et cetera and other costs that affected by energy, but just the diesel effect, had we normalized for energy, that incremental margin would have been about 63%. So what we thought was going on there. The other driver is the downstream businesses. As Ward indicated earlier, there was a headwind from the liquid asphalt costs. Those costs were up about 65% in the quarter, some of it driven by volume increase in the business but also driven by the over 25% increase in liquid. And then finally, we had the couple smaller acquisitions that we’ve done over the past 12 months that have some start-up costs that are built into that margin to get us to that loss position. So those are really kind of the macro drivers if you’re looking at it from a consolidated perspective.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: That’s helpful. But I guess what I’m still struggling with is on a reported basis, 39% decremental. We talked about normalized being 60% incremental, so there’s like a $12 million swing. And I’m just wondering if you could give us – what was the acquisition costs or at least break out the liquid asphalt, the dollar hit?
Anne Lloyd: Well, total energy for aggregates was $5.7 million. I’m sorry, that doesn’t include the liquid. But if I get back to – yeah, the liquid was about $3.5 million and acquisitions about $1.2 million. So what’s that, $5.7 million and $3.5 million and $1.2 million; about $10 million-ish.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. But you had a $9.5 million tailwind on pricing, right?
Anne Lloyd: Yes.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Ballpark?
Anne Lloyd: The ballpark.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I’m still just trying to figure out how if your revenues are up 12 on a reported basis, your profits are down 5?
Anne Lloyd: We had the strength of pricing, your volume weakness came in and hit you, walked you through the cost increases, and you have the up on Specialty Products and then just the miscellaneous other. I mean we’ll give you a detailed bridge in the Q when we file it.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. We can follow up offline. I guess the other thing I just wanted to clarify my own understanding, is most of the downstream business in the Western Group?
Anne Lloyd: All of it.
Howard Nye: Yeah, it’s all in the Western Group, Ted. It’s Arkansas...
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I guess I’m just curious to reconcile the margins there because if I got my numbers right, it looks like you had the best incrementals in the Western Group and the weakest incrementals in the South and Mideast. So if that was the biggest area of problem on the COGS line pulling through liquid asphalt, how did you manage to get the best incremental profitability in that segment?
Anne Lloyd: Because the base aggregates business got a 65% incremental margin.
Howard Nye: And it had up volume.
Anne Lloyd: And it had up volume. I mean that was the issue. If you look at the West Group as whole and just pull out downstream businesses and pull out acquisitions, the base aggregates business there had incremental sales of about $13 million, incremental profit of about $8.5 million. That’s a 65% incremental margin. And then what happened is the downstream businesses and liquid asphalt costs ate into that and the acquisitions ate into that.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Best of luck this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thanks, Ted.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the vertically-integrated businesses with the proposed asset swap, how the exposure might look once that’s done and if that’s going to – how much as a percentage of total all aggregates sale that might grow to?
Howard Nye: You know what, Adam, that’s a transaction I’m actually pretty anxious to talk a lot about. The issue that I’ve got is if I talk a lot about it, I’m probably going to have lawyers running in here telling me that I can’t talk much about it. So what we clearly have in place right now is an arrangement with Lafarge that’s ordinary and customary in these transactions. What we’ve put out is what we’ve put out right now. Does it have a more vertically-integrated component in Denver than we have in the river? Absolutely, it does. Is it something that we want to talk to you about? Sure, we do. I think one thing that as you’re just thinking about that business in your mind going forward, and we will clearly give you much more color on it once we buy it, one thing that I would ask you to keep in mind is ideally, if I’m buying a Rocky Mountain business, I’m not wanting to buy it at some point in November or December. And as a practical matter, we will. Of course, we’re not buying this business for a quarter or for half a year or otherwise. We’re buying this business for the long-term and we think it’ll be attractive. And we think the vertically-integrated components of it will be attractive as well and we think really where we’re looking at vertical integration in Denver, it’s because that’s the way that market is built. So we will have to think about that. We will give you more color on that. And you will need to think about simply the time of year in which we’re buying it. But as a practical matter, Adam, that’s probably all I could say right now.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Okay. I was – and just – you might not be able to respond to this, but the reason I was really asking not so much as to the immediate winter impact, things like that, was just more that you’ve talked a little bit about or a lot about liquid asphalt and so I was just wondering as your vertical integration grows, if it’s going to grow at all, what’s that going to do to your ability to pass on costs and how it’s going to impact margins. The other just question, you highlighted some scenarios in certain places where you’re positive on potential for infrastructure growth next year or beyond that. But let’s say those things don’t come to fruition and our government can’t get along. And with your commentary that you expect mid-single digit declines for infrastructure this year and all with stimulus winding down, that paints a pretty negative picture absent those other potential positives you talked about on just on the potential for even flat volumes next year. Is that wrong to think about it that way?
Howard Nye: Well I mean obviously we’ll tell you more about it next year when we get there. I’ll tell you this: I think to the extent that stimulus is going away, I wouldn’t put a lot of stock in the fact that stimulus is going away. So I think if you come back and take a look at it, you can certainly see what McGraw-Hill is saying about next year. I mean they’re looking broadly at total construction being basically flat next year. They’re looking at non-res being up slightly. They’re looking at res being up double digits. And they’re looking at what they will call non-building, but the Street’s portion of that being down somewhat next year, I mean that’s at least what someone like McGraw-Hill is seeing. But again, I think you do have to come back and look at the very specific states in which we operate and decide what you think those different markets are going to look like. We feel relatively confident with what we have in North Carolina, what we have in Texas and the markets that particularly drive us that we won’t see a big falloff. Keep in mind, even in a state like Indiana that has had not had great volumes this year, you still got major moves going on in that state for another several years. So I think back to the point that I made in the conversation with Kathryn, we certainly don’t see something just going off a cliff here at all. That’s not where we are and it’s not what we see right now.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Thanks. First question is just kind of thinking about the DOTs, at least in the short run with the kind of limited extension or continuing resolution that we have in place now, has that been enough to get them to kind of go ahead with notices to proceed on more jobs? Or are they still kind of just sitting on their hands given the limited visibility here?
Howard Nye: You know what, Trey, I think what it does is it more dictates the nature of the work than the amount of jobs being bid. And I think what we’re seeing in that is we will see a ramp-up in resurfacing, we’ll see a ramp-up in shorter-term projects, we’ll see a ramp-up in maintenance. I think the primary thing that having these CRs do is it does not put states in a position, unless they have some form of alternative financing, to go forward with large infrastructure projects right now. So for example, we are seeing in the Charlotte area what may be some very nice, attractive toll work that’s coming there and that bidding will be going on later this year or very early next year depending on what their schedule looks like. So we are seeing some large projects, but I think the primary thing that DOTs are suffering from right now is the lack of ability to go and do really large projects that’ll be built up from the ground that will require base product as well as clean washed stone. I think we’re going to see a lot of clean washed stone go out the door if they continue at CRs. I think the bigger issue is what projects will be coming that’ll consume some base product.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Okay. And then you mentioned earlier don’t put a lot of stock in stimulus going away and things like that. It’s obvious that it’s going to pretty much have run its course this year. I guess are you saying that in 2011, and I don’t know what the current numbers are on how much of that stimulus funding has flowed through this year, but I know earlier in the year, it was expected to be about 30% of the total. But are you saying that Martin Marietta specific or just the industry really isn’t benefiting a whole lot from that funding that’s rolling through in ‘11?
Howard Nye: Yeah, I’ll give you a take on that. Here’s the Ward Nye take on the way that came out, Trey. Around 21% of stimulus went in 2009, or about $5.6 billion. In 2010, around 42% of it went, or about $11.5 billion. We think by the time we get to the end of this year, around $5.9 billion will go, or around 22%. In other words, it felt a lot in ‘11 like it did in 2009. If you tally those up, that’s going to be around 85% of stimulus that should be outlaid here by the time we get to the end of the year, leaving around 15% for 2012. And keep in mind, these jobs really need to be completed by the end of December 2012. That was the way the stimulus program was built. And I think back to your question, I don’t think it’s a Martin Marietta issue. I think in large part, it’s an industry issue. I think what happened here is I think the hope was that stimulus would be something that was incremental on top of what DOTs were doing and I don’t think at the end of the day in most places that it was. I think the metaphor that we’ve used is it was there to fill a hole and it never quite filled the hole. So part of what’s interesting to me is to watch stimulus going away and then come back and look at DOT budgets because what we’re seeing in most instances is when the stimulus goes away, it’s not a very traumatic effect. And I think that’s what brings us back in our mind to the view that it came in, it didn’t have the effect that I think people thought or hoped, and when it goes away, I don’t think it’s going to be a resounding thud to the industry and certainly not to our company.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Okay. Well that’s – I appreciate your thoughts there too. And then just on the acquisition, I know you can’t really talk a whole lot about it here, but just could you tell us how the pricing in that market looks as far as just the absolute pricing looks relative to the rest of your markets?
Howard Nye: Not yet. I’ll be able to talk to you about that in a few months, Trey. I just can’t go there right now. I do understand. And I wish I could.
Anne Lloyd: Good try. That was a good try, Trey.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Okay. Well that’s it. That’s all I got. Thanks, guys, and good luck this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Hi, thanks. It’s Garik Shmois. Just two quick questions. Just the first one is, Ward, could you clarify a little bit more on the change to the guidance this year? And what you’re seeing incrementally? You mentioned some of a negative mix towards maintenance projects as weakening some shipments to infrastructure. But I think some of the comments in the release also pointed towards declining non-res relative to your initial thoughts as well as I think some of those type of projects. So could you maybe rank order what caused you to be a little bit more cautious on your guidance today?
Howard Nye: Sure. I think as we looked at the infrastructure, I mean I think we’ve just looked at the public numbers that are out there, so I think where we’re guiding on that is very consistent with what you may see from McGraw-Hill, what you may see from PCA or others. I just think for a lot of the reasons that we discussed, whether it’s transportation funding, what’s going on in the House, what’s going on otherwise, I think it’s made that more challenging. I think as we look at the non-res component of it, again, we’re just taking than down very slightly. And keep in mind really what happened there last year is we saw a really nice pop, primarily driven by what was going in the shale activity place in Haynesville and Barnett. What’s happened this year is you’re seeing a pretty significant movement from Haynesville and Barnett down to the Eagle Ford. What’s driving that, to give you background on it, is when you’re drilling in Haynesville and Barnett, what you’re getting is natural gas, but that’s pretty much the show. What’s happening when you’re in South Texas is you’re getting both the gas and you’re getting the oil as well, a much richer play, literally. So you’re seeing a pretty significant shift that doesn’t actually happen overnight. Now what that tells me over time, they’ll be back in the Haynesville and Barnett at some point because they do have lease obligations there. But I think the low natural gas prices and that migration has dictated some of that. I think the other thing that we’ve seen is there’s been just a change in some of the power projects that we had going on as well. There’s some power projects in Georgia, South Carolina, and in fact, one in Virginia. The projects themselves aren’t done; they’re just simply in different phases of it. So again, as we come back and moderate our guidance, I think those are the type of things that we have in our thinking, as well as part of what we’re seeing and not seeing in wind energy. So I think really as we’re looking at the change that we have in non-res, it’s all around what’s either happening or in some respects not happening in energy. But here’s the real catch to it, Garik. I mean the fact is volumes are just so low generally anyway that if you have any degree of movement or pullback, in another day, in another hour, what we’re talking about here wouldn’t even have been a speed bump. It wouldn’t have been noticeable. But in this type of climate, it is and we just need to tell you about it.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. No. That’s fair. And then just on pricing, just a little bit more clarification. You mentioned a lot of pricing this year was from increases in 2010 and a little bit of a benefit from mid-year 2011 price increases. Is it fair to assume that you’re really not seeing much of a change in the competitive landscape, meaning it’s not getting incrementally more competitive given that 2011 volumes are going to be negative?
Howard Nye: No. And actually, I’m not sure that much of what we’re seeing here is an effect of what happened in ‘10. I think what we’re seeing here is really what’s happened in ‘11. And I see the competitive atmosphere as much more favorable today than it was a year, a year and a half ago.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks. And actually just one more question just on the operating margin in Specialty Products. Is this below 30% operating margin in the business that you’ve generated here so far through 2011, does that look like it’s sustainable assuming the steel utilization rates are north of 70%?
Howard Nye: You know what, if steel stays where it is, yes it is. And the other thing that’s really helped that business is I’m going to go back and talk out of the other side of my mouth. And we were talking about how great it was last year with all the ramped-up activity in the shale fields. I think clearly the biggest single energy piece usually of Specialty Products is what’s going on with natural gas. So you’ve got two nice things. You’ve got steel running at a 70%-plus rate and you’ve got actually very low relative speaking natural gas. And that certainly gives that business a nice tailwind.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Great. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Garik.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.
Brent Thielman – D. A. Davidson: Hey, Ward. Hey, Anne. Ward, you just answered my question on the energy side of things and the shale gas opportunities. So thank you.
Howard Nye: Thank you. Good to hear your voice.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.
Tom Lofton – RBC Capital Markets: Hi. This is actually Tom Lofton on for Bob Wetenhall. Just a quick question; I know that some people in Washington have been talking about infrastructure bank. I know it came out as part of President Obama’s Jobs Act. And I was just wondering if you could give us some thoughts about what you guys think of the potential for kind of an infrastructure bank to either substitute for some kind of big reauthorization? Or just what you guys think the effect of that would be?
Howard Nye: You know what, there’s a great op-ed piece in McClatchy today that John Kerry and Kay Bailey Hutchison wrote. So you’ve got two Senators who usually land on the opposite side of most things coming in and basically being supportive of an infrastructure bank. I think an infrastructure bank can be an important piece of overall transportation legislation and vision. I don’t think it’s a panacea for all of this and I don’t see it really being a substitute for a core program. And actually I think if you go and looked at some of the commentary that Barbara Boxer in particular has had around this, I think that’s where her head is as well. And I would tend to agree with that. I think there’s certainly a place for it and I think the leverage from it can be helpful. But I think at the end of the day, we’re looking at a need and clearly a much larger program at its base that will really move this business and frankly move the country forward.
Tom Lofton – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Great. And what would you – what would your thoughts be on a two-year bill versus a six-year bill? Would you still be happy to see kind of a two-year bill at similar levels as before? Or do you think we really need that long-term bill?
Howard Nye: You know what, my quick answer is I like long-term bills because DOTs like long-term bills and it lets them plan. So I think longer is better, but high is awfully good too. And I guess as a public policy perspective, I hate to ever see a number in an area that’s just a core-critical national need go backward. So I think you would have to look at those two things together. So from my perspective, if you could end up with a six-year bill and end up with something that’s up or at a minimum flat, personally I’d rather have six than two because I think that lets DOTs do some things and we can certainly help them do that.
Tom Lofton – RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thanks.
Howard Nye: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Piers from Cleveland Research.
Russell Piers – Cleveland Research: Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Russell.
Russell Piers – Cleveland Research: Hi. I know you talked about the positive public markets in terms of obligations throughout Texas, North Carolina, Northern Virginia and D.C. I kind of just wanted to ask, see if there are any markets out there that were kind of heading in the opposite direction in terms of negative obligations looking out to next year.
Howard Nye: You know as a practical matter, I’m not seeing any states that are really in a bad place in that perspective, at least in the markets in which we operate. And I think that goes back to one of the points we made to one of Kathryn Thompson’s questions earlier; I think location and state matters a lot in this business. So from where we sit, North Carolina looks pretty good. We like the sales tax initiative that’s coming up in Georgia. We like major moves in Indiana. We like the new DOT plan in Virginia. The DOT budget in Iowa is very steady as well. And they’ve got a nice resurfacing plan that’s coming out in Florida. So really, as I just kind of rip off those top states, they’re all in reasonably good shape. And I think the other thing to keep in mind is much of what’s going on in states relative to a DOT spend are truly dedicated funds. So if you come back and take a look at most state budgets, I think the U.S. average is that 16% of funds that are going to state DOT projects are coming out of the general fund. Most of it’s coming out of some degree of dedicated gas tax, vehicle transfer fee or otherwise. And I think that puts most states in better shape on DOT spending than they would be in other parts of their business. And I think when you take that and then lay it on top of what’s our geography, I think then you end up typically finding out that most of our states tend to have very specific plans that give them a very stable outlook comparatively going forward. So I hope that’s helpful, Russell.
Russell Piers – Cleveland Research: Yeah. That’s great. To follow up on the Georgia tax, I was wondering if there were any other states taking similar actions in terms of trying to implement taxes or anything of that sort?
Howard Nye: I don’t know of any other state that has a plan out there exactly like Georgia has right now. They’ve been talking about that for a while now. As we sadly heard earlier in the call, they’re not advertising it apparently remarkably, but it’s been out there for at least a year and a half and I can tell you that is clearly DOT’s Plan A in Georgia. So it’ll be curious to see how that goes. It may end up being a blueprint for others.
Anne Lloyd: What we are seeing though, Russell, is alternative financing means, whether it is by a tax like Georgia’s proposing or toll authorities like we have in North Carolina and Texas. We are seeing that states are having to address transportation issues because it’s a local matter. The one positive I think that we will see, and I guess the 12 different regional commissions in Georgia will demonstrate this, we hope they will, is that about 75% of the time, if there is a local funding initiative on a ballot, it will pass, again, because it’s a very local and personal issue to each individual state. But we do expect that to be a long-term trend that you’ll see that the states’ creative and innovative funding is going to be more – play more of a role in the infrastructure rebuild.
Howard Nye: Of necessity.
Anne Lloyd: Yes.
Russell Piers – Cleveland Research: Great. And just one more quick question. On the military demand, there seems to be different across different geographies, but some areas are starting to lose a little bit of steam in terms of the military building and the related bidding around the military demand. And I was wondering if you were seeing that within any of your geographies that are tied mainly to military demand or if you expect that military demand to remain pretty robust going in 2012 and through 2012.
Howard Nye: So far, we have not seen a pullback in that. And keep in mind, North Carolina and Texas won so disproportionately during the Base Realignment and Closure process, or the BRAC process, that we don’t anticipate that there’s going to be a significant pullback there at all. In fact, it’s been going on for a series of years. I remember in one of these same calls two years ago, maybe three now, of serving that there was more work going on around Fayetteville, North Carolina than there was in our entire Greensboro district. And while it may not be at that type of level all the time, we do see a certain degree of sustained activity at those large bases in the Carolinas and in Texas right now and don’t see a pullback meaningfully at all, Russell.
Russell Piers – Cleveland Research: Great. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.
Howard Nye: Thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. In general, 2011 has unfolded broadly as we expected. We’re pleased with our operating results. We anticipate building on this momentum. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and the closing of our Lafarge transaction with you, as well as our outlook for 2012 when we talk again in February. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes our program. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.
Howard Nye: Good afternoon and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’re pleased to report our quarterly results and believe you’ll find this discussion helpful. These second quarter results are further evidence of our ability and determination to execute and maintain a disciplined approach to the profitable management of our business. Despite an extremely challenging operating environment contributed to by both man and Mother Nature, we performed well. That’s not to say though that we’re satisfied with our results. But despite the difficult operating environment, we demonstrate our ability to achieve a primary goal, continuous improvement. While aggregates pricing momentum in the first quarter continued with 2.6% increase in average selling prices of our heritage aggregate product line over the prior-year quarter, factors beyond our control such as erratic weather patterns, reduced investment in infrastructure products and low levels of private sector construction all limited our aggregate shipments and reduced our net sales compared to the prior-year quarter. Now, for the specifics. The second quarter results reflect our continued focus on controllable production costs as well as general and administrative expenses. Overall, we earned $0.78 per diluted share in the quarter compared with $1.18 in the prior-year quarter. Our Specialty Products business achieved another significant accomplishment setting quarterly records for both net sales and earnings from operations. Based on first-half results and our outlook for the second half of the year, we have raised our full year earnings guidance for this business. We are pleased that aggregates pricing improved in most geographic markets led by 6.8% increase of these group. Rising energy prices have also contributed to certain midyear pricing increases. We believe this pricing growth is sustainable and have accordingly raised our full year overall aggregates product line pricing guidance to an increase ranging from 2% to 4%. As you all know, whether is a significant non-controllable variable in aggregates businesses and during the second quarter, many operations in Midwestern states were constrained by historic levels of rainfall and extensive flooding along both the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These extreme conditions restricted both production and shipments in a number of areas, our Southeast business being hardest hit. In addition to weather hindrances, the macroeconomic environment and spending constraints have led to the absence of long-term commitments to infrastructure investment. In fact, state spending is trending toward projects that are more maintenance oriented. Additionally, jobs funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or stimulus are winding down. The combination of these factors led to a 9% decline in our quarterly aggregate shipments with a noteworthy 11% reduction in shipments to the infrastructure end use market. Despite these declines, we are encouraged by year-to-date increases in contract lettings in several key states including Texas, Iowa and Florida. Aggregate shipments to the nonresidential end use market decline 9% for the quarter, primarily due to reduced energy sector shipments caused by the timing of transitions from Haynesville shale opportunities in Louisiana to Eagle Ford shale reserves in Central and South Texas. The delayed recovery and residential construction negatively impacted volumes and most of that sector declined 6% for the quarter. The general consensus among economists is that current levels of residential construction activity are unsustainably low. However, economic uncertainty and the backlog of the foreclosures have lowered expectations. And lastly, ChemRock and rail shipments were 3% less than the prior-year quarter. Enterprise-wide aggregate volume declines of over 9% and decreased net sales made incremental operating margin as we previously described at relative to volume recovery less meaningful. That said, our Western United States division did see increased net sales. In that environment, we delivered an incremental operating margin well in excess of the 60% stated objective. We continued to benefit from two areas of focus you’ve heard me discuss previously, cost containment and prudent capital investment. For example, direct production costs for our heritage aggregates product line were down more than 2%. With reductions in repairs, contract services and depreciation more than offsetting a 13% increase in non-controllable energy costs. Diesel represents the largest single component of our energy expense. For the quarter, we paid an average of $3.08 per gallon of diesel, 45% more than the prior-year quarter. Higher diesel fuel costs reduced our quarterly earnings by $0.06 per diluted share. Our lean selling, general and administrative expenses continue to be industry-leading. Compared with the prior-year quarter, SG&A expenses decreased $1.9 million or 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales. This reduction reflected lower pension and stock-based compensation costs. Our Specialty Products segment continued its exceptional performance. Even compared with a record second quarter and 2010, this business established a new quarterly record for both net sales and earnings from operations. Net sales at $50 million for the quarter were 4% above the prior year, reflecting strong demand in both the chemicals and dolomitic lime product lines. The sales increase along with cost control measures produced earnings from operations of $19 million, a 380-basis point margin improvement over 2010. As we have clearly stated, a strategic goal is to establish or maintain leading market positions in geographic areas with attractive demographics. During the quarter, we acquired a family-owned aggregates business in western San Antonio, Texas where population and economic growth have consistently outperformed the natural average. In addition to the six acquired aggregate locations, the business also had downstream asphalt and ready-mix concrete operations. This acquisition adds more than 200 million tons of aggregates reserves, complements our existing vertically integrated operations and enhances our leading market position. We continue to prudently allocate capital and for the six months ending June 30, invested $59 million in organic growth initiatives. Of note, we started the new dolomitic limestone project at our Specialty Projects business in Woodville, Ohio. This $53 million project should be substantially completed by the end of 2012. During the quarter, we also opened an aggregates sales distribution yard in Tampa, Florida, expanding rail distribution network serving the Interstate 4 corridor. For the full year, we have revised our forecasted CapEx to $155 million, $20 million less than previous guidance. We also believe it’s critical to maintain one of the industry’s strongest balance sheets, especially in an environment like this one, which not only gives us the ability to make capital investment, but also to have significant working capital flexibility as previously reported, refinanced $242 million of notes maturing on April 1 with borrowings under our term loan and our accounts receivable facilities. In substance, we replace fixed rate debt with variable rate debt. Due to the current low interest rate environment, the refinancing lead to a $3.1 million savings in interest expense for the quarter. At June 30, 2011, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.09 times, in compliance with the limit of 3.5 times. We were pleased that during the quarter, Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed our credit and upgraded the outlook on our long-term rating from negative to stable. We continue to monitor activity in Washington, D.C., viewing transportation funding as our most significant risk for the rest of 2011 and into 2012. As a reminder, we are currently operating under a congressional continuing resolution that extends Safe-T Lew through September 30, 2011. Recently, Representative John Mica, Chair of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, released his committee’s outline for a reauthorized transportation bill. The committee’s proposal is a six-year bill with total funding of $230 billion, a 30% reduction from current funding levels. Senator Barbara Boxer, Chair of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works committee supports a two-year reauthorized bill with total funding of $109 billion, essentially consistent with existing funding levels but adjusted for inflation. While we support many of the reform aspects included in both proposals, the level of funding is widely regarded as wholly insufficient. In fact, on June 27, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report indicating decaying infrastructure cost the United States $129 billion per year. $97 billion per year added to the cost of operating vehicles plus travel delays that cost $32 billion. Notably, the U.S. Chamber’s Tom Donohue commented on this report saying and I quote, “Without more robust economic growth, the U.S. will not create the 20 million jobs needed in the next decade to replace those lost during the recession and to keep up with the growing workforce.” The debate, lack of consensus and now inevitable committee work related to the national debt ceiling and 2012 budget will likely constrain congressional ability to negotiate, resolve and enact reauthorization bill prior to the expiration of the current continuing resolution. As uncertainty emanates from the federal government, the willingness of states to use alternative means to fund their long-term aggregates and sensitive projects will become more significant. We continue to believe that federal and state officials realize investment in infrastructure is an efficient means of job creation, necessary for economic growth and essential to public health, safety and welfare. It is increasingly challenging forecast full-year 2011 given the variety of factors beyond our direct control. We expect infrastructure funding by state to remain relatively constant and at least 25% of stimulus funds to be spent this year. While our outlook assumes additional continuing resolutions to maintain current federal funding levels, the extent of such levels is uncertain. Further, as mentioned earlier, project mix is shifting to more maintenance level work. These factors suggest that aggregate shipments delayed in the first half of the year due to whether may not be recovered in the second half of the year. Another complicating issue is the uncertain timing of housing recovery. Given this backdrop, we now believe that overall aggregate shipments will range from flat to down 3%. Infrastructure shipments are expected to be down in the mid-single digits. Nonresidential shipments should range from flat to up slightly. ChemRock and rail shipments should be stable compared with 2010, and the rate of improvement in residential shipments should be better than 2010. We expect aggregate production cost per ton to range from flat to slightly less than 2010 despite rising energy costs. Our Specialty Products segment is now expected to contribute $54 million to $56 million in pre-tax earnings. Selling, general and administrative expenses will likely be less than 2010 primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense should be approximately $60 million, and our effective tax rate should approximate 26%. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. If the operator will now give required instructions, we would be pleased to address any questions you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Arnie Ursaner with CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Good afternoon, Ward. Good afternoon, Anne. I think in summarizing the report you had, the things you can’t control, weather and volume caused some of the problems, but I think you guys continue to do an extraordinarily good job controlling the issue can control. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect flat to down cost per ton, and that’s despite higher energy costs, yet the starting point is you’ve been doing a good job cutting costs. Can you tell us more about the types of actions you’re taking to continue to bring down costs on a go-forward basis? And how sustainable it is?
Howard Nye: If you go back and take a look at it, the areas where we’re reducing our costs tend to be depreciation, which is really just coming through from the lower capital investment over the last several years. We are seeing reduced M&R, we saw that pretty considerably. We are seeing reduced contract expenses. Here’s what’s really driving that, Arnie, if you go back and look at what we did with CapEx prior to the downturn, we were investing in CapEx well in advance of DDNA. What that’s given us the opportunity is pull back on CapEx now, but at the same time run at a very efficient level. What you remember is that last year we saw slight spike in some of the M&R expenses as some volume came back. We anticipated at the time that M&R as we went into this year would be lower and indeed it has. Going also to contract expenses or bringing in third-party at times to do work in your facilities, one of the big expenses we would typically incurred during the year, as you can imagine, is stripping what working to remove or cover reserves in some places. Fallback can be a significant expense. We have seen those expenses come down considerably over the last several years. In fact what I would tell you today is in some places you are probably moving dirt for about half of what you would have several years ago.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: So I’m assuming that your view is this is sustainable. It’s not a short-term blip that’s causing it was something you view as sustainable?
Howard Nye: Arnie, we do think it’s sustainable and again, to – in my view I think the story of the quarter is several-fold, and I think you hit it. I think we do have sustainable cost decreases that we have put through. I think to have a quarter where you see volume down nearly 10% and pricing up and production costs down is actually pretty remarkable and I think our operating teams are in a position to continue that type of operating performance.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Okay. If I could, could you expand a little bit more on your midyear price increases? The discussions you’re having with customers and I know it takes time for them to work their way in. I assume the much bigger impact will be on next year?
Howard Nye: Well that – your timing is exactly right, Arnie. The conversations have been much more robust this year than they have been in the last couple years. Again, we anticipated that would be the case. If really I take a look across our entire enterprise we’re seeing it almost in every major market in which we are operating. We’ve seen increases of a buck a ton on list price in certain places in North Carolina effective July 1. We have seen increases of $0.25 to $0.35 per ton in portions of the Midwestern United States as well, by that I mean Indiana and Ohio. Notably, we have seen price increases on clean stone, on asphalt stone in Florida. We have seen probably 2.5% increase there as well. Obviously Texas has come through this downturn in a lot of respects better than most and we have seen price increases, again, midyear in San Antonio, Houston as well as South Texas. Even if you move up to North Texas, which traditionally has been one of the more challenging markets, we’re seeing $1 per ton type increases on limestone and $0.50 a ton increases on sand. Now in fairness, a lot of those increases in the North Texas are more geared toward September 1. So the practical effect is you won’t see a lot of impact of that in this year, you will feel it next year and it also raises the bar on pricing as we move into 2012.
Arnie Ursaner – CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Arnie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Vencil with Davenport and Company. Your question, please.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Good afternoon, guys.
Howard Nye: Hey, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: So Ward, if I look at your volume guidance, your updated volume guidance and I back out what you did in the first half, it looks like your range applies you think volumes are going to be about flat to up 5% year-over-year for the back half. Am I looking at that right?
Howard Nye: I think you broadly are looking at the right. To give you a sense of how we were seeing the trend in the second quarter, Todd, and I think this probably gives you a sense of how we’re looking at it even separate from your numbers, our volume in April which was remarkably wet month as you recall were down 21%. Our volumes in May were down around 5.5% and by the time we got to June our volumes were down 1.7%. So we were clearly seeing the rate of decline, decline. And I think as you come back and take a look at the second half I don’t think you’re miles off.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Yeah. If you look at your plan, and just as background I mean when I sort of feed in the first or second quarter actually into my model and I looked at your guidance I was – my full year implied number without changing my back half assumptions was within the range of your guidance. If you look at your plan, is that sort of what happened there? I mean we obviously had a difficult second quarter and you made the point that you don’t necessarily think you’re going get everything in the back half that you may have missed out on in the second quarter. But have you really had to make many modifications in your own expectations for what you’re going see in the second half?
Howard Nye: No, Todd. We really haven’t. I think the primary thing that you’re seeing and it’s not just a Martin Marietta issue I think it’s across the industry, I think there’s a bit more caution. I think you see that in some of the guidance at McGraw-Hill and others has come out with. I mean if you remember when we came into the year, McGraw-Hill was saying overall construction was going to be up 8%. I think their latest revision shows overall construction down 2%. The only issue that I would tell you, we continued to watch carefully though as we move into the second half of the year, is really what’s going to happen with energy as we go through the year. When we came into this year, we assumed for example, that energy was going to be up pretty considerably. And if you look at what diesel was last year at this time, diesel was $2.12 a gallon and we’ve just finished a quarter where it was $3.08 a gallon. And in fairness, it’s probably trending more toward call it $3.20 a gallon. So clearly, it’s heading up.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Got it. And you anticipated my next question which is – are we had about 320 right now?
Howard Nye: That’s certainly what the forward curve is showing, yes, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Okay. And can you tell me how many gallons you’ve burn in the quarter?
Howard Nye: Yeah. Well I can tell in Q1 we’re at 6.8 million. In Q2, we were at 8.4 million so Half 1 was 15.2 million gallons and my guess is that will put us somewhere in the mid 30’s again by the year end, Todd.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Got it. On the CapEx guidance cut, which you mentioned but you didn’t kind of lay out why you did that, can you talk about what’s behind that?
Howard Nye: Well if you think back to the way we set up our guidance at the beginning of the year, Todd, really what I had was around $100 million going into our Heritage Aggregates operation. We had around $25 million going this year into the new kiln in Woodville, Ohio. We had $25 million in some separate growth initiatives in the South, and we had around $25 million also in competitive capital. And we were going to save the competitive capital for capital projects that just had really very, very attractive returns but we were also going to have that there to pull back at some point if we needed to. So what you’re going to see is the pullback in the competitive capital.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Is that just in response to – related to the reduction expectations for the year of the business?
Howard Nye: It is. In fact, it is my view that I think everyone is simply being more cautious and we viewed that as a prudent step.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Fair enough. Just a couple more on capital if I can? Can you give us any more information on the San Antonio deal in terms of what the volumes look like there and the financial performance looks like?
Howard Nye: Yeah. What I can tell you is, again, we’re very pleased with what we’ve bought in San Antonio. From the Tousch family it’s the closely held transaction. We believe that obviously is going to fit very, very nicely with the Heritage business that we have there. It is 220 million tons of reserves. Pricing in the San Antonio market is actually well below the corporate average. And we feel like obviously growth in Texas for a lot of reasons will be a pretty attractive place for us to participate particularly in that world. That’s a business that certainly has permitted capacity annually 6 million tons. It’s not 6 million tons at all right now, Todd. But that gives you a sense of what it can do. And then again, that’s what we have from a purchase price perspective and I’m sure that’s something that you’re curious about. We obviously have agreements in place that prohibit us from talking about that. But if you were looking at this transaction and trying to put some metrics to it, what I would encourage you to do is to go back and take a look at how we’ve valued reserves if they were on a lease basis. And take a look at that and then come back and you’ll get a pretty good sense of the type of value that we placed on this transaction.
Anne Lloyd: And Todd, for this year, obviously in the quarter we had about $1.7 million of one-time costs related to business development and acquisitions that were included in OI&E. And your question on financial performance, we actually expect it to be – the transaction to be slightly dilutive this year but accretive in ‘12.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Got it. And I guess final question from me and I’ll jump back in the queue, but it looks like from the cash flow statement there was about $10 million in there that used to buy in – the joint venture interest. Can you tell us what that was?
Howard Nye: Yeah. That was JW Jones. It was a transaction that was done just about – almost exactly 10 years ago. And there was a certain amount paid down at closing and this was finishing up the transaction. It’s a business that’s west of Indianapolis so it’s been a part of our portfolio for a decade.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Got it. Thanks, a lot.
Howard Nye: Sure, Todd.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Garick Shmois of Longbow Research. Your question please?
Garick Shmois – Longbow Research: Thank you. Just wondering just looking at the pricing in the Southeast Group, second strong quarter on a year-over-year basis just wondering if you could flesh out a little bit more what’s happening there? Is it mix driven? Is it price increases that you secured in 2010 that have benefited this year? And just wondering how sustainable this mid-to high-single digit year-over-year increase is for the balance of the year?
Howard Nye: Garick, that’s a good question. I guess it’s driven by several different things. If we look at that Southeast market in many respects it’s the most single challenged market that we’re faced with. In this quarter in particular, if you think about what’s happening with some of the material coming down the river, among others. One (audio gap) even in markets that I think are incredibly challenged right now, and if I had to give you two markets that were remarkably challenged, I would say North Georgia is one and Alabama is one, and we’re actually seeing price increases in both of those markets. I think something else that’s notable is when I take a look at what’s happening in Florida, because I think this is now at least the second quarter in a row that we have come back and told you that pricing in Florida is at least from where we sit moving in the right direction. We saw pricing in Florida for the quarter up 7%. I think going back to your question, really what this tells us, and I think we’ve been consistent with this, is that the businesses looking at least for some degree of equilibrium it. Now none of us may be happy with the equilibrium from a volume perspective that we found, but at least some degree of it has been found. And I think we you’re starting to see now is that our business and I think really the industry is starting to move in a way that historically you would have seen it move. So I think there is sustainability to that, and that at least gives you some color on what we saw in that market.
Garick Shmois – Longbow Research: That is. A question on the disruptions in the river market, all those disruptions behind you is market operating smoothly right now? And is it possible to quantify at all how much of the EBIT impact came from these disruptions, whether it’s higher cost coming from increased distribution, or changes in inventory or something like that?
Howard Nye: I’ll answer your first part initially. It is operating in a much more efficient, more normalized setting right now. It really worked, as you can imagine, you had initially upriver disruptions at your production facilities. Then you also had disruptions at your yard facilities down river for a while as well, so it literally affects the entire system over a period of time. The system is operating much more efficiently and almost normally now. I think as a practical matter to your point though, it’s hard to go back and really come out with varying degrees of precision on what is attributable to weather, what is attributable to a reduction in sales, and what was attributable simply to not be able to operate in a highly productive mode when you are dealing with those types of downstream circumstances. But what I can tell you is obviously the volume numbers in River were off 20-ish percent. It was pretty considerable.
Anne Lloyd: Garick, if you look at the second quarter results as a whole, the 9.3% decline in volume cost the company about $35 million of gross profit. It’s difficult to bifurcate that between weather and/or other issues that might be going on in the underlying economy, but a pretty significant hit.
Garick Shmois – Longbow Research: Thank you.
Howard Nye: Garick, the last component I think that you asked that we have responded to, you did ask us about mix. And that is a fair question, because when we came into the year last year, we told everyone that mix was going to have a considerable effect on what was happening with pricing. Our view was coming into this year mix would not, and I think as a practical matter from what we are seeing from an enterprise-wide perspective, we are safe to say we have been right, that mix has not had a profound impact on that.
Garick Shmois – Longbow Research: Thank you. One last question from me, you mentioned that you are expecting to see bigger shift to maintenance projects, at least in the near-term. If we assume this is going to continue over the next several years, if we have a secular shift to more maintenance projects, can you speak to the potential implications on pricing and volumes with respect to the aggregate intensity and maintenance projects versus new road build?
Howard Nye: Maintenance projects tend to be relatively aggregate intensive, because in large part they are hot and asphalt driven. From that perspective, you’re dealing with and end-use product that is primarily aggregate. I think the biggest challenge that you’re going to have in projects that tend to be more short term, is that you are going to be back in a mode that you are pushing several individual products to the exclusion of others. In other words, clean washed stone is going to move to the head of the line and you’re going to have base products move again toward the back of the line. So I think running your businesses at their most optimal and keeping your inventories in balance will be the biggest challenge in that. From an average selling price perspective, you may actually see some help there, because that tends to be some of your more high-priced products.
Garick Shmois – Longbow Research: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your question, please?
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Thanks for taking my questions today. Certainly it was a challenging quarter from a volume standpoint, given all the weather. I think as we read today, we would have been better served as a roofer than a producer of rock in the quarter. So understanding the overall volume, which makes sense, where we need a little bit of help is understanding how much gross margin this pressure by volume versus mix versus some other external factor? Could you walk through that for us?
Howard Nye: I think the best way I can address that, and I think Anne might have said it a few minutes ago, we sat back and looked at the quarter and we really parsed it out. We saw as we analyzed our gross profit grow forward that volume weakness all by itself, all by itself cost us around $35 million. Kathryn, I might switch back to the envelope, we’re probably in the 70% fixed cost land right now. So when you have 9.3% volume decline, that’s really going to show. Again, Kathryn, back to the comments that I made to Arnie, I think when you’ve got that degree of volume decline and can still demonstrate the ability to pull back on direct production costs and raise price, it’s a pretty good story. But right now this business is very clear respects about volume.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Thank you that’s helpful. I was also hoping you could clarify a little bit more how you are looking at calculating that aggregate production cost per ton? Are you pulling out certain items? Because as we were looking at it, there’s a little bit of an increase, but it could just be a difference in how you are looking at calculating that?
Anne Lloyd: Kathryn, we’re talking about direct production cost, so those are at-the-quarry costs. So as you look at the total distribution of costs, you’re taking out that embedded freight that moves items between their producing and selling locations and the differential between the direct production costs that went down and then total production costs that went up are on the liquid asphalt cost, rounding cost of that where there’s other energy-driven factors as well as some energy pass-through on those freights.
Howard Nye: So Kathryn, if you were sitting where I am, I can tell you the buckets that I’m going to look at when I calculate that, I’m going to look at labor, I’m going to look at supplies, I’m going to look at M&R, I’m going to look at DD&A, and in large part I’m going to look at contract services. Those are going to be the primary direct cost drivers that we are going to be focused on.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. I will follow up later with a few more questions I have on that. Also, in prior quarters you’ve been able to talk about pricing at the end of the quarter versus inter-quarter. I assume that there hasn’t been a meaningful change or if there has, could you expand on that?
Howard Nye: No, Kathryn. There has not been a meaningful change. So you are correct.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. And finally you talked in the release that some of the lost revenue in the quarter from weather would not necessarily be recaptured. What’s driving that?
Howard Nye: Again, I think that is simply back to the caution that a lot of people have right now, Kathryn. I think we are going to see some pull back obviously in varying degrees of non-res in some parts of the country. I just think we are taking a more conservative view, and I think we’re following at least in part what we have seen others, including McGraw-Hill, indicate as they have looked at the balance of the year.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: Good afternoon everyone.
Howard Nye: Hi, Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. With regard to that last comment, Ward, you guys have seen in the last couple of months I guess, projects that you thought would go ahead or might move forward either delayed or canceled. Is that a fair statement? And specifically on infrastructure, given all of the uncertainty over the highway bill and the ongoing dithering in Washington, are states getting frustrated and pulling back, canceling projects in real time that is causing part of that caution too?
Howard Nye: I don’t think we are as cautious right now on the infrastructure piece, Jack. That looks stable. Actually, I’ll tell you, the state component of it actually looks remarkably stable, much more stable than you would think, and that is a good thing actually, because our view is that the states are going to have to step up in ways over the next several years and frankly through this next highway bill in ways they have not had to historically. So really, what we’re more focused on when we’ve become more conservative in our view, tends to be more the nonresidential and portions of res as well.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: With regard to residential, I think you said that you expect I guess a little bit of improvement in the back half maybe a better rate of change, less negative, however you want to say it. Is that as much anything a product of the easier comparisons in residential that we all know we have post-tax credit expiration from last year?
Howard Nye: That’s entirely what’s driving that. I guess the other comment that we would have is simply as that we look at res. That’s the answer to the near-term issue. As we look at res in the more long-term, part of what we’re still struck by is if you stood back and look at res from 1959 to 2010, housing permits during that 50-year period averaged 1.4 million per year. Here we have been parked at 600,000-ish for the last couple years. So to your point, the compares are going to get easier, but at the same time, what we have right now is artificially low. We understand why. At the same time, at some point that will have to turn and we think that it’s going to turn slowly. And we think we’re going to see certainly some improvement in the second half.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. I was just curious to your comment about two examples of very challenged markets being North Georgia and Alabama. What specifically in North Georgia is causing it to be among the most challenge markets? Is it the housing issue?
Howard Nye: I think it very much is a housing issue. I think North Georgia probably as much as anyplace was considerably over built. I think they could say the same thing relative to their office and retail portion as well. Keep in mind even as you look at Georgia, that’s one of the few states that actually funds its transportation broadly from its general fund as well. That’s a bit of an anomaly from other states particularly in the South East. And while Georgia has in large part gotten their system much more on track here of late, that’s certainly a DOT that over the last several in particular, have suffered, Jack.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Great. That’s very helpful. Thanks very much.
Howard Nye: Certainly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities. Your question please?
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Right. Thank you. Ward, you mentioned to a previous question that there was a volume story right now and I agree with that. But I was wondering and I recognize this is a very difficult question to answer considering the difficulty in even thinking about the rest of 2011 but if you look into your crystal ball for 2012, do you see that being a meaningfully, a meaningful growth year for volume? There’s plenty of reasons to believe that 2012 could be a dud as well. So I’m just curious and when you think about the future when do you think we might get that volume spike that you need?
Howard Nye: The nice thing about being in the volume place we are right now, you don’t need much of a spike to see remarkable returns because any degree of volume at this level that moves upward has a profound impact on what we can do. Here is how I would walk you through that, Adam, and I’ll probably go in reverse order. Our ChemRock and Rail segment, I think is a very different segment for us than it is for others. I think we clearly have a much more significant part of our portfolio that goes that way where the number – when ship on UP, BN, CSX and Kansas City Southern and number two on Norfolk Southern. What I’ll tell you is we view that portion of our business going into next year as very stable. Again, you’ve heard what I just said to Jack about res. We see that as something that is likely to be stable to very much improving. It’s simply a matter of timing. I think what we’re seeing this year on non-res as I’ve said in my comments, in large part right now revolves around the types of transitions that are going on from the Haynesville to the Barnett shales into the Eagle Ford. We are seeing some degrees of life in non-res, in big box and some other activity there. So we continue to think that’s going to show some improvement. And then, when you come back to the infrastructure piece of it, in large part it’s going to be driven by what happens in Washington DC. The things that we can’t control, Adam, are really threefold. We can’t very much control volume, we can’t control energy, and if anything that we’ve all learned from this past week is nobody can control Washington DC. If we can come back and get some degree of at least extension of safety loop perhaps through the election, I think we’ll all feel better about that. The one commentary I would come back and offer you on that, and Adam, our view still is that we’re are likely in our view to have a CR through the presidential election. There is increasing conversation. In fact folks that we speak to in D.C. gave us as much as a 60/40 read on it yesterday, that there would be some form of a highway bill. Now, I’m not of the view that is going to be a six-year highway bill, and neither are most of the folks that we speak to, but there is a growing view that there may be a two or maybe a three-year highway bill. Depending on how that shapes out, it could certainly influence the way that the infrastructure piece of that pie looks as we go into 2012. We will obviously give you considerably more view on that as we go into next year. But keep in mind that one thing we still need, and it still pertains to this year, before we even look at 2012 is we need the CR that’s in place that expires on September 30 to go through the end of the year.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: That’s helpful. Thank you. I just had a question on pricing, what is the elasticity towards pricing now? If you were to say, you want to go for volume work, would lowering prices meaningfully help drive volume? Or is it just a question of you highlighted caution of a lot of times on this call, and your customers might be cautious. If you lowered prices or just kept them flat while everybody else tried to raise them, would that even drive meaningful volume for you? Or is it just an inelastic market right now?
Howard Nye: At this point I don’t think it does that. And candidly, my view is we have a product that is so difficult to get at and is so irreplaceable, I wouldn’t be inclined to do it that way. I don’t think that’s the way it works right now anyway.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Thank you.
Howard Nye: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc. Your question, please?
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: Good afternoon.
Howard Nye: Hi, Trey.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: More just kind of going back to the comment you made on the recovery in Commercial, I know you mentioned big box, but are you actually seeing signs of things starting to turn there on the Commercial side currently? Or is that just more kind of an outlook for the balance of the year?
Howard Nye: No, Trey. We are seeing some of it starting to turn currently. It is not widespread. We see some of that in Texas. We are seeing some of that in portions of North Carolina, those are the primary places that we are seeing that. We are seeing pockets of it, but again those are pockets that we would not have seen for the last couple of years. So we are seeing some they are trending much better.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: But is your expectation for a more broad kind of improvement in the back half? Or do you still kind of look for just these little pockets?
Howard Nye: I expect more in the back half, little pocket-type activity, Trey. That’s probably as good a way to put it as any.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: Okay. Then the only other question I had was you announced this acquisition, and then in the past you have talked about acquisition opportunity and things. And I’m really just trying to get a feel for M&A front, are you starting to see more opportunity now with what I would expect outlooks and potential sellers’ outlooks becoming – kind of coming in some? Maybe becoming more realistic?
Howard Nye: What I would tell you, Trey, is that we are still looking at a good number of acquisitions. Actually, this transaction that we announced today, is one that we started on and finished ahead of some deals that we have been working on actually much longer than that one that are still very much in our pipeline. The dialog that we are having in a number of geographies is probably not remarkably different today than it was a year ago, but it remains very, very study. The dialog can range from again very small closely held businesses to much larger businesses, from markets in which we currently operate to markets in which we would want to have a significant presence. So they are all over the board. But that is still a very busy segment of our group.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: Okay. And then as far as other folks at the table I guess, if you will, are you starting to see people getting more aggressive in this field? Are you starting to see people more people at the table? Or is it about the same?
Howard Nye: It’s the usual suspects who are there right now, Trey, and in candor, it’s not a lot of them. So if we’re looking at a transaction that might be in one of our markets or in an adjacent market, maybe there is two or three, but typically not more than that.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc: Okay. That’s all I have. Thanks.
Howard Nye: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your question, please?
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Hi. Thanks, guys.
Howard Nye: Hi, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I was hoping to come back to Kathryn’s question and I apologize if it’s just been a real long earnings season for me. But is there any way you could provide a bridge to help us reconcile the change in your revenue versus the change in your operating profits? Because when I look at just the Aggregate business and there you’ve got an $18 million decline in revenues; I’m looking at it which is net and you’ve got a $28 million decline in profits. And so, I know Ward, you went through kind of the bits and pieces but could you give us a little more granularity to help us understand what was absorption versus it look like if diesel was $0.06 that’s about $4 million of pre-tax kind of hit? Can you just bridge us a little more with a little more color, or Anne?
Anne Lloyd: Again, I think the volume piece of it was the largest effect of that with $35 million of cost. We had non-production costs and liquid asphalt costs that hit us. And non-production cost meaning anything we might be buying and having to use for resale. There were, again the costs of the raw materials for liquid asphalt, and then freight demerge and other charges that we had during the quarter from the activity or inactivity perhaps on the river were some other of the driving factors that’s causing that differential.
Howard Nye: But Ted, what I’ll tell you is, is you can rack up everything that Anne just said with the exception of volume and it’s going to be a very small number.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. And just for a point of clarity on that, is most of the liquid asphalt concentrated in the West region where you’re more vertically integrated?
Anne Lloyd: It’s all there.
Howard Nye: It’s all there. Our only asphalt businesses are in San Antonio and in Arkansas, and at the same time really when you add those up, I want to say last year probably 1.2 million tons of asphalt probably 350,000 cubic yards of ready mix so not a big business there for us in that respect.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: And yet still the gross margins in the West were up 220 basis points whereas Southeast were down 1,500 basis points and Mideast almost 600 basis points?
Anne Lloyd: Yes. The Southeast is where you’re going to get hit with all the freight demerge and those kind of charges, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. Great. The second question I was hoping to ask you is would you be – to Adam’s question, just thinking a little longer-term out, would you be willing to either take a stab or give us the framework for how to think about when you might be able to get back to some semblance of mid-cycle earnings? For us, we think about that being about $5 for your company and I recognize there are a myriad of factors between here and there. But whether it’s – if you would even take a stab at is it 2013 in your internal models, ‘14, ‘15, ‘16?
Howard Nye: You know what, I’ll tell you that’s where you guys are at your best. So I’m going to let you go back and sort out when you think that’s going to happen. I guess what I would tell you, Ted, and you’ve heard us say this before and this isn’t necessarily a mid-cycle answer, this is a top cycle answer. It doesn’t take the 80 million tons that we’ve lost to get back to the point that we’re making more money than you saw at peak. We could do that by picking up half of the volume that we’ve lost. It’s still remarkable to me to go back and take a look at tonnage that we’ve just done in the second quarter of this year. 33.9 million tons is the lowest amount of tonnage for the second quarter that we’ve ever seen as a modern company. If I went back to 2007, we had 50 million tons in the second quarter. In other words, I’m not got to answer your question on what mid-cycle looks like. But I’m telling you all this takes is it takes some degree of volume and it does not take 205 million tons of volume to get back to peak.
Anne Lloyd: And Ted, we’ve said before that in our internal models so for a five-year view, we had assumed that there would not be a new federal highway bill until after the presidential election. So, I don’t think that our five-year forward view has changed drastically because I think we’re going to – unfortunately prophetically be correct that it’s probably going to be an extended or at least some short-term bill that gets us through a presidential election and then sets in place a better bill for the industry.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. And then the last question I have is just probably a little more clarification, Ward, I think I heard you say state spending has been pretty stable. And I guess the way we look at it is based on the monthly Census Bureau data. And then the last months on a reported basis those numbers have been down double digits in each month. And if you back up the stimulus they’ve been down north of 20%. And so I’m just – could you just help us understand when you say, state spending’s been stable? Given these numbers are really state spending because that’s where the money – the work gets done, any more clarity on how you are kind of viewing it as stable would be great and I will leave it at that.
Howard Nye: I will. Yeah, I think in large part when we say that’s what we’re doing, that is we’re coming back and looking at the states that are big players for us. If we’re looking at NCDOT, again, we continue to see good, steady work here in North Carolina, even as we look at 2011 going into 2012, we see the transportation budget having gone up somewhere, say, call it, 4.5%, 4.6%. We continue to see construction and engineering spending in a state like North Carolina at over $2.5 billion. At the same time, we go to a state like Texas; Texas had $4 billion worth of lettings last year, $4 billion worth of lettings this year. And actually, we continue to have very nice infrastructure work in that state, participating in the DFW connector, Highway 161. We’ve got some work now on the LBJ in Texas. At the same time, even looking at states like Iowa that are coming back with good, solid budgets moving forward and even looking at the extension of roads like Highway 20, which actually matters a lot to us there. And then when we come back and take a look at even the states that we said were going to have a significant stimulus effect for us this year, keep in mind we had said, Paul, stimulus spending had been a headwind for us for the last several years. We thought it was going to be helpful to us this year. What we had pointed out in particular is that Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Georgia had lagged and they did, but calendar outlays in those states so far this year, Texas has put out 15.1% of its stimulus dollars; Louisiana, 20.5%; Florida, over 16% and Georgia, over 16% as well. And all of those states are still showing 30-plus% remaining for the balance of the year, and that’s on top of what they might have otherwise. So as we look at the states and really where their budgets are right now and what they’re able to put out on the floor, it is not bad. Part of what we have seen even as we look at month like May, is general fund revenues in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina are all up and sales taxes in all of those states are up as well. So again, we recognize that the federal side of it is a pretty tough story. I think what I’m trying to tell you with this is that the state side of it is probably better than you would otherwise think, at least from where we sit.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I think you may have indirectly kind of, it’s kind what I was asking. If you look at the leading edge of stimulus spending.
Howard Nye: Yeah.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: I was down 60% in June, down 50% in May and down 30% in April. And that’s for the whole country, so recognizing there are footprint differences.
Howard Nye: Yeah.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: You’re leading edge kind of read on stimulus spending is obviously leaves you as comfortable as you are.
Howard Nye: Yeah it does.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Okay. Super. Well I will jump back in queue.
Howard Nye: All right. Thanks, Ted.
Ted Grace – Susquehanna: Thanks, guys. Good luck this quarter.
Howard Nye: Thank you much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Lavine of J.P. Morgan. Your question, please.
Scott Lavine – J.P. Morgan: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
Howard Nye: Hey, Scott.
Scott Lavine – J.P. Morgan: So I realize this is probably hypothetical, but really what I’m trying to do here is determine what your second half outlook appears to be now versus maybe what it was? And I know you don’t initially guide to the second half, but it sounds like your outlook for private sector in general is a bit weaker and I’m just kind of wondering whether – because the volume growth that you are implying in the second half now is consistent with what we were looking for. Is the idea here that the weather pushed off some demand in the back half of the year but you are reducing your private sector outlook? Can you comment maybe in terms of what your new second half outlook is versus what you guys were previously thinking for the second half? Without maybe putting some numbers to it because I know you don’t guide first half versus second half.
Howard Nye: Well again, if we’re looking at infrastructure, to give you a sense of what we’re saying for the year, we started out at the beginning of the year saying it’s going to be flat to slightly down. Then as we come up with revised, we’re saying it’s going to be down, but it’s going to be down in the mid single-digit range. So that’s going to be the single biggest movement that we think you’re going to see. We took non-res too, and we showed it up mid single-digit range of the beginning of the year and now we’re saying that’s going to be flat to slightly up. So those are the two places that we’re seeing movement. Realistically, as we look at residential and as we look at ChemRock/Rail, we’re not seeing that much movement right now.
Scott Lavine – J.P. Morgan: Got it. And if we think about your Specialty Products guidance, okay, you’re raising that. You’re talking about a positive demand environment there. Is it really demand driven? Are you outperforming initial margin expectations for that business? What is driving the upside to prior expectations for that business?
Howard Nye: The last number I saw in steel, steel was running about 76%. You have to believe in many respects that’s the single biggest driver on that. But at the same time on the chemical side of it you’re in the season where slurry is going to certainly need to find a home, and it is. Those are the two issues that are really driving that. And obviously (inaudible) plays in that business has been a good strong component as well. So I would say is a threefold driver on specialty products.
Anne Lloyd: And Scott, when we originally formed our plan for ‘11, in the Specialty Products business, we assumed a 70% utilization in steel, and it’s run 76% really the whole first half on average.
Scott Lavine – J.P. Morgan: Got it. That’s clear. Maybe one last one, just to clarify the point on the Highway bill as well, when you guys say that you’re expecting to see this CR through the end of the year, I don’t know if it ends up going to the next election, but does that imply continuity of funding in your mind? Or could there be a scenario where there is CR, but at a reduced level of funding? Or is the point at which funding is reduced coincident with the new highway bill of some sort whether it’s two, three or six years?
Howard Nye: I think what we have been anticipating is that you would have CR, and it would be relatively flat.
Anne Lloyd: Again, there is probably a pretty slim chance that Congress after recess would come back and get a bill passed before the September 30 expiration. So our thoughts are we will see some kind of continued resolution into calendar ‘11 just to allow them to finish the legislation, and essentially that being at flat levels, and then moving in to whether or not we do a two-year deal at the levels. Right now it’s kind of 60-40 split 60-40 way that we will get to a two-year bill.
Howard Nye: But again, Scott, there does need to be a bridge that goes to the end of the year. There’s no question about that.
Scott Lavine – J.P. Morgan: Understood. Thanks. Makes sense.
Howard Nye: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Baugh of Stifel Nicolaus. Your question, please?
John Baug – Stifel Nicolaus: Just a couple of small ones. One, ‘12 to ‘11, what would you anticipate would be your stimulus headwind? And then secondly, are you indifferent on housing starts, whether they are multifamily versus single-family? Or does that make a difference? Thank you.
Howard Nye: It does make a difference. Let’s start about stimulus first. What we are seeing is what we think probably somewhere between 25% or 30% stimulus goes this year, again we track it over time. Around 20% in ‘09, call it 40% in ‘10, year-to-date so far this year, 12%, 13% by the end of the year, 30%-ish we think 8%, %, 10% of stimulus going into next year, and I think that’s the best way to track that. I think going back to your question on housing, does multifamily or single-family housing matter to us? The answer is yes. It does. We very much prefer single-family housing. Keep in mind in the areas that we have most of our geography, you tend to be building not just homes, but you tend to be building subdivisions as well. So when we look at our residential component, it’s not just going to be the stone that’s going into the structure itself or into the lot. It’s going to be the stone that’s going into the roads that are going in a subdivision, it’s going to be the curbing, it’s going to be the sidewalks, it’s what’s going to be what’s going into the utilities as well. Clearly, that is much more stone-intensive undertaking than is multifamily. So we recognize that historically we have been a good leading indicator of when res activity is starting to take off. The fact is this time we are likely to be lagging indicator, because you still have a lot of subdivisions that have been built out, you just don’t have homes there yet. So instead of requiring a bunch of stone on the front end, you’ll see what I like to refer to as sticks and bricks on the back end.
John Baug – Stifel Nicolaus: Great. And lastly, quickly I think I understand the issues with Q4 and the continuing resolution. If we look at ‘12 and you’ve cited this is your biggest risk if you will, the infrastructure piece. King of handicap if you can if we got a new bill, you’re saying if we get a continuing resolution for the next year or two, I guess it would be the similar rate. But handicap the best case and worst-case in your mind if we do not say a two-year bill? And I think you mentioned Mica’s bill, which was down 30%. Is that sort of the worst-case number? And then what in your mind would be the best-case number for say a two-year bill starting in ‘12? Thank you.
Howard Nye: It’s hard to handicap that. Again this past week is evidence of anything can happen over any period of time. We certainly haven’t seen anything that’s worse than the 30% down that Mr. Mica and his committee have come out with. So I think you could certainly bracket something saying that’s the bottom end of it. At the same time when Mr. Mica talks about 30% down he’s talking about a very different bill. He is talking about a bill that is all highways, bridges, roads and streets. It’s a much more pure bill and in fact what he would submit to us is that given the bet of that bill, given lots of reform components, given how much more quickly some of those projects will go to market you might have a more aggregate-intensive bill with a smaller number. And that’s certainly something that we as an industry like to hear. But at the same time I think that’s probably your bottom end of that net. I think the upper end of that net could be considerably more attractive if people came to the view that spending on highways actually equals investing in highways and investing in highways is a good way to create jobs because whether you want to look at numbers that Arco or others have put out over the last several years for every billion dollars of infrastructure investment you’re creating somewhere between 28,000 and 30,000 jobs so very job generative. And at some point in this economy that’s going to matter a lot. So if that becomes something that can really get some fire today and in fact I did hear some of the President’s comments today just after the Senate voted, he again was talking about infrastructure. But the upside beyond where Mica is right now, where were Barbara Boxer coming out of the Senate it’s hard to handicap that.
John Baug – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks, Ward.
Howard Nye: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Wetenhall of RBC. Your question, please.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: Just curious on SG&A spending. It looks like pension expenses down. I was curious for 2011 do you think it would be good to use 125 million type a number?
Anne Lloyd: For total SG&A or pension expense?
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: For total SG&A. I think you were 133 last year.
Anne Lloyd: Yeah. Our pension expense we expect to be about $18 million this year. I think that differential – that run rate probably is about right, Bob.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: Sorry. So look to use like a 125 number?
Anne Lloyd: Yes.
Howard Nye: You’re there, Bob.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: Got it. And you mentioned in the ChemRock business that volumes looks stabled, any thoughts on pricing giving strong demand from steel?
Howard Nye: Again, that’s a different world. ChemRock and rail for us to give you a sense of it, the rail piece of it is what’s going into balance. The ChemRock in that is what’s either going into agricultural lime or it’s going into flue gases sulfurization. So really what’s going into steel is more coming out of our Woodville, Ohio facility into specialty products. So, again, if you are talking ChemRock and rail I think we see business to the railroads being very steady. I think actually in the second quarter we saw some pretty significant headwinds on getting some of those scrubber stone to power plants because much of that’s going up and down the Mississippi River and there wasn’t much going down the river except water during the second quarter. Again, the Ag lime season tends to be even the first quarter or fourth quarter. As you recall last year in Q4 we had a very strong Ag lime quarter. Our sense still is that there’s pent-up demand in Ag lime. It can be cold in Q4 and Ag lime still goes, it just can’t be wet in Q4 for Ag lime to go. So I think that probably gives you more color around the ChemRock/rail piece.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: So it’s somewhat contingent on the weather?
Howard Nye: For Ag lime in particular that’s entirely true and it’s a Q4-driven phenomenon
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: How about the steel-driven business?
Howard Nye: In the steel-driven business again steel is running at 76% of capacity right now. It’s very steady, it’s been very good for us and we’ve clearly seen steel move around a bit and pricing has behaved very nicely.
Bob Wetenhall – RBC: Good. Okay. Thanks very much.
Howard Nye: All right, Bob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Betts Jr. of Jefferies. Your question, please.
Mike Betts Jr. – Jefferies: I got disconnected earlier so if you already covered this please say so. There was some pretty serious disruptions on the river system. I think some of your quarries were flooded in the quarter. Were there any kind of one-off costs or in reality people can’t work? Are they just manning the pubs and stuff like that?
Howard Nye: Hopefully they weren’t manning the pubs, Mike. But I’ll tell you what, if volumes don’t get better they may be manning the pubs. But no, we didn’t have any significant one-off costs in that. I think the primary thing that we were faced with is you just had remarkably inefficient operations when you had that much water going through. Our yards down river were hit. There were some places that access was cut off. I think when people want to reflect on what’s going on with the River business they think instinctively about what we have up and down the Mississippi River. That was certainly affected by – actually we’ve had some operations affected by it up and down the Missouri River as well from that Fort Calhoun operation in particular felt some effects from it. But again, it’s more of an efficiency issue than it is a one-time cost issue.
Anne Lloyd: We did have a little bit of demurrage which is just really idle freight movement, but not huge.
Mike Betts Jr. – Jefferies: Okay. Last question on that river issue because obviously we see the percentage of shipments for the full-year by the river, by water. Is that much different in Q2 and Q3 because presumably Q1 some of that stuff doesn’t happen?
Howard Nye: Yes. You’re correct, Mike. I mean it’s going to be a Q2 and Q3 story, no question.
Mike Betts Jr. – Jefferies: Understood. Thank you very much.
Howard Nye: All right, Mike. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your question please?
Brent Thielman – D.A. Davidson: Hi. Good afternoon. Just one left for me. Obviously energy diesel’s been moving up. But if you were to see some moderation in the coming quarters, does that concern you and your ability to continue to get that momentum and pricing that you see?
Howard Nye: Right. I think in many respects if you look at the comments that I said, I said I thought the rise in energy prices contributed to it. I don’t think that’s really going to be big driver of it. I just think you’re starting to see these markets haven’t found equilibrium. I think you’re starting to see pricing move in the way that you would typically expect it to in this industry.
Brent Thielman – D.A. Davidson: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Nye: Sure, Brent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Clyde Lewis of Citi Group. Your question please?
Clyde Lewis – Citi Group: Good afternoon, Ward. Good afternoon, Anne. Two questions if I may. One on the contracting prices that are coming through in some of the markets particularly in terms of infrastructure at the moment. Can you sort of give some idea of what’s happening on that front? Obviously you’ve started to push up prices a little bit more. I’m just wondering what the overall impact of how much rock there might be within the sort of dollar of sort of overall stimulus spending or highway spending? Just give an idea of where that’s moving? Second question I had was on fixed cost elements. If we are looking at maybe a stable sort of continuing resolution through 2012 or even slightly lower new bill on the (inaudible) would you be tempted to go back and have another go at the fixed cost space in some meaningful way at all?
Howard Nye: Let’s talk about pricing first. The primary thing you are probably thinking back to, Mike, is the types of pricing that we were seeing in 2009 when some of the stimulus work came out originally. There’s no question that stimulus pricing came in considerably lower on an ASP percentage than things we’d seen prior to that. The infrastructure work that’s going now is not going for the types of pricing that we would have seen in 2009. So I think when we’re showing you what our pricing looks like now, you can assume that’s what it’s going to look like going forward on infrastructure as well. As a reminder, as a practical matter, most of the work that was stimulus related that was more pricing challenged, my guess is will be rolling off by the end of the year. So I think you’re seeing not stability there. With respect to volumes and what we do with fixed cost I guess the one thing I would say to you is again to have volumes down 9.3% and have production costs down is a remarkable story. This is the company that understands costs and this is a company that is focused on continuous improvement every year, every quarter on costs. So we’re going to have a go at costs anywhere that we feel like we need to. And that’s something that, Mike, when you are in a world that you are looking at $10.27 per ton for material, you better be good on costs and we understand that.
Clyde Lewis – Citi Group: Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: All right, Clyde
Operator: Thank you our next question is from Todd Vencil of Davenport and Company. Your question please.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Hi, guys. Just one more if I can.
Howard Nye: ...a bite of the apple. Go ahead, Todd
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: On the Specialty products, obviously strong performance as you discussed in the first half of the year. If I look at your guidance, it would appear to imply a pretty big slowdown in the second half relative to the first half and even if you factor in what I am guessing would be normal seasonality, is there something going on there? Or are you being conservative? Or what’s going on there with those numbers?
Howard Nye: I think that really goes back to the word that you and I used in our first conversation, that was we are approaching things with caution right now. I think if steel stays where it is, Todd, I think you can run your math and do some calculations there. But again, I think it’s conservatism and I think it’s caution.
Todd Vencil – Davenport and Company: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Howard Nye: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your question, please?
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up to a question I had earlier, how much did price benefit from higher embedded freight costs in the quarter?
Anne Lloyd: I’ll take that for you. It was huge, because volumes were down quite substantially in that part of the world.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research Group: Okay. I’ll follow-up after the call.
Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nye for any further remarks.
Howard Nye: Again, thank you all for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call and for your interest in our company. We continue to operate in a challenging operating environment, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by operating as a best-in-class company, optimizing our assets, performance and teams. And we look forward to discussing our third-quarter results with you in November. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. That concludes the conference. You may disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Q4 2009 and full year financial results conference call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Nye, President and CEO.
C. Howard Nye : Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and yearend 2009 conference call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter provided vivid examples of both the perils and prospects of the current economic environment. The final three months of 2009 was a predictably difficult conclusion to a challenging year in the aggregates business. Quarterly shipment declines of 23% were driven by both the weak economy and the wet and early onset of winter muting October’s historically strong volumes. A different story however concluded in our specialty products business. Reasonable sales volume and product pricing in both our chemical and lime sectors complemented substantial in place cost controls generating record quarterly and annual performance. Still for the year consolidated net sales for the corporation declined over 19% with earnings per diluted share of $1.91 including an $0.18 per share impact for legal reserve and the $0.11 per share dilutive effect of common shares issued in 2009. In 2008 diluted earnings per share were $4.18.  We experienced down aggregate volume in all major geographic areas of the business. Our 15th consecutive quarter of declining aggregate shipments. To put this in perspective, heritage aggregate volumes have declined 40% since the peak of the cycle in 2006, a cumulative peak to trough decline of 80 million tons. In 2006 at the aggregate’s industry peak, 80 million tons represented the United States fifth largest aggregates producer. For the quarter specific geographic volume declines ranged from down 33% in our river, southwest and north Texas Oklahoma to only 6% in Indiana. Distinct from those particular shipment volume extremes some of the hardest hit areas for our company included Florida down 30%, Carolinas off 24% with Charlotte and Greensboro off 30% and 26% respectively. Ohio was down 24%, North Georgia off 22% and Iowa which had been comparatively strong until winter’s arrival was off 20%. Aside from the areas just mentioned, most markets were off on a percentage basis in the mid to high teens. Against that steep and prolonged volume backdrop we saw 1% decline in aggregate pricing for the quarter compared with the prior year period. However, following 15 quarters of aggregate shipping declines, we’re pleased that on an annual basis the vast majority of our geographic areas saw positive pricing movement. For the year ended December 31, 2009 pricing for the corporation’s aggregate products was up 2%. However, during the evolution of the year we saw pricing extremes from up 23% to down 6%. That said, on an annual basis most geographies increased average selling price on a percentage basis in the mid single digits while the two negative geographic areas Florida and River were off 6% and 3% respectively. While for the fourth quarter pricing is down 1%, the vast majority of our geographic markets were either flat or up compared to the prior year period. Most notably North Carolina was flat which alone provides a meaningful example of the importance of mix both geographic and product and the analysis of accurate average selling price. Cost management is and remains a top priority for the corporation. During the fourth quarter as well as the full year for 2009 our cost of sales were reduced in every significant controllable category. This includes labor, energy, supplies, maintenance and repair and contract services. We have consistently and carefully reduced our work force in keeping with the decline in our business.  By way of example, the 123 million aggregate tons shipment level we experienced in 2009 closely approximates our 1997 shipment volumes. In comparing the corporation’s current cost structure to 1997, headcount is nearly identical although we now have three times more assets. Yet volume and headcount is where the similarities end, as compared with 1997, 2009’s gross profit per ton was over 50% higher. The result of improved pricing during the relevant time period as well as disciplined cost management and effective capital deployment. Our specialty products business continued its outstanding performance posting record earnings from operations and operating margin for both the quarter and full year. This stellar performance was driven by stringent cost controls with notable spending reductions in labor, energy, contract services and supplies. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter expanded over 1,100 basis points to a record 32.4%. For the fourth quarter, earnings from operations of $9.6 million increased by $8.9 million over the prior year period. For the full year, operating margin as a percentage of net sales expanded by more than 800 basis points to 24.9% despite a 14% decrease in net sales. SG&A expenses declined by $1.4 million for the fourth quarter and $11.9 million for the year compared with the prior year period. Total personnel costs declined $4.6 million for the year in spite of absorbing $6.4 million in additional pension expense. This result is consistent with our stated aim during the course of the year. Even though 2009 was difficult, our corporation continued to generate excellent cash flow. For the year, $318 million of cash provided by operating activities was only $27 million below 2008 despite consolidated net earnings that were $92 million below the prior year. The decline in net consolidated earnings which were largely offset by a sharp pull back in capital spending to $139 million, careful control of working capital and lower cash taxes. Also consistently protecting our balance sheet and liquidity we closed both the quarter and the year in excellent shape. At December 31, 2009 we had $264 million in cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity of $423 million and an investment grade credit rating. We expect to use available cash and liquidity to satisfy our April 2010 maturities while thereafter retaining adequate financial flexibility to respond to marketplace opportunities. Lastly, we took a non-recurring $11.9 million share related to a legal matter as of December 31, 2009. This non-cash charge was recorded in other operating income and expenses net and reduced diluted earnings by $0.18 per share. As we prepare for 2010 it’s obvious that 2009 spending impact of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act was well below expectations. This delayed economic infusion should mean that the 2010 combination of expected record federal investment in surface transportation and increased stimulus spending will help drive real infrastructure growth.  According to forecasts by the American Road Transportation Builders Association, the value of 2010 infrastructure spending is expected to reach $90 billion, an increase of 8% over the estimated 2009 level. Although there are general concerns regarding state and local spending, states are expected to continue to provide matching funds for the traditional federal aid program investment and spend their stimulus funding. As a result, our 2010 aggregates view is framed largely as follows. First, a very slow first quarter as contractors delay project start ups until winter weather has played out. Number two, increased infrastructure shipments is over 80% of stimulus money was obligated in our top five states in 2009 but less than 15% was actually spent. Third, moderate increases in shipment volumes to the residential construction market, albeit from a historically low base number. Next, steady growth for what we now refer to as our chem rock rail segment, formerly known as other comprised of our desulfurization material, agricultural line and railroad ballast products. Lastly, declines in the commercial non-residential area as customer confidence and credit issues continue to affect that sector. As a result, aggregate volumes are expected to increase 2% to 4% however, the measure of whether 2010 brings our expected volume growth is primarily dependent on the degree of the non-residential downturn. Further, although geographic and/or product mix together with competitive issues will make aggregate pricing a more challenging area, we currently anticipate flat to 2% increased pricing in 2010. Based on our current economic view, aggregates volume and pricing growth in a flat to deflationary cost environment should lead to increased sales, improved gross margin and profitability in aggregates in 2010.  In specialty products, we expect a good year with an estimate of $40 to $42 million in pre-tax earnings from that segment. That concludes my prepared remarks. At this time I am pleased to take any questions you may have.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arnold Ursaner – CJS Securities. 
Arnold Ursaner – CJS Securities: My question relates to pricing, in your prepared remarks you spoke to the fact that the majority of your markets did have positive price increases for the year but highlighted in the southeast group that in the fourth quarter saw a 7% decline in price year-over-year. Could you comment a little bit more on what the issues are that are affecting pricing in the southeast and maybe what some of the dynamics are both short term and long term that are affecting that particular market?
C. Howard Nye : Really when you’re looking at southeast in this context, you need to think of two things, you need to think of River and you need to think of Florida because those are two markets that are really long haul markets for us that have very attractive absolute pricing. But then there are two dynamics that are underway in each of those markets. Number one, Florida is a relatively dislocated disjointed market right now, the competitive pressures in Florida are immense and the volume pressures in Florida are considerable as well. The other issue that we were faced with in the quarter, I didn’t say much of it in my prepared remarks is weather was pretty rough particularly in portions of the southeast and that clearly affects the River business considerably. So when you’re dealing with a very different weather environment and market environment in River and you have it in Florida as well, the combination of those two is powerful.  What I’ll tell you is in both of those markets because of the absolute pricing numbers that you have due to the transportation component, if you can effectively capture the transportation component, that was difficult to do this quarter particularly in River, then you can take the pricing degradation that we saw in River all by itself and probably cut that just about in half. If you took that and cut that in half all by itself it would really almost move that pricing for the quarter to looking considerably more flattish. So in large part it was a distance market. The other concept I would suggest to you is keep in mind about 30% of our market tends to be a long haul distribution market. We’ve done that very much by design because our view is this is a long term business, if you want to be in this business for the long term and you don’t have that capability you’re going to be at a competitive disadvantage.  We feel like what you saw with pricing in this quarter is simply a onetime snap shot event that you have to deal with to have the type of business that we believe we want to have and our investors want us to have of the long haul. No pun intended by the way.
Arnold Ursaner – CJS Securities: My other question is a real quick one related to the cost side of your equation. Can you highlight what your diesel costs were for the year in 2009, where they are currently? I think one of the real questions I’m leading to is your view that you hope to keep these costs flat over the course of the upcoming year. It seems surprising given the fairly rapid rise and increase we’ve seen in the price of diesel over the last few months.
C. Howard Nye : Here is where we are, for the year diesel was at $1.62, for the quarter diesel was at $1.94. Really, what we’ve done is we’ve said we think it’s going to be more next year as it was here towards the end of the year. We’re not diesel speculators, the fact is it may be more than that, it may be less than that. If it moves in large part, it simply moves. I would remind you a couple of things about diesel, when energy pricing moves it isn’t always a bad thing for this industry. At times pricing will tend to follow that. The other thing that it does is if you have very well located positions as we do, this certainly tends to make it more difficult for others to predict those markets. But, that’s our approach on diesel right now. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc.: Just a couple of questions, first off for the markets that you’re planning a price increase for 2010 has this already been implemented? Then I guess with that do you expect to kind of flat to up 2% price for the year to pretty much be throughout the year or should pricing improve as the year progresses?
C. Howard Nye : Obviously you won’t see much of anything at least in the first quarter of the year and in large part what you’ll see Trey is pricing will start to ease in during Q2 in particular. It will be fully in place once we get to that part of the year and it will roll through the balance of the year. It’s not going to be the same in all markets Trey, there were some markets that were down this year, other markets as you’ve heard that were remarkably up. I’m not sure that you will see the types of extremes next year that you saw this year but in large part the pricing that we’re looking at for 2010 has been communicated in all the varying markets in which we participate.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc.: Then do you have any sense at all of what kind of impact the product or geographic mix had on price in the fourth quarter? This was the first time we’ve seen a slight decline in pricing out of you guys and I’m just wondering what kind of impact those two things, product mix and geographic mix could have had?
C. Howard Nye : The geographic mix clearly would have had an impact. As you’ve seen the biggest degradation in volumes really hit two different places and the Mid East which is going to include Carolina so when we see more volumes move out of Carolina we obviously feel that. Then as discussed what was happening in Florida and what was happening in River which are both distance markets also had an impact on that so really more of what we would have seen would have gone towards portions of the southwest that overall tends to have lower product prices. I think you really had more of an issue in this quarter of geographic mix than otherwise.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc.: Looking in to the first quarter with I guess it’s going to be a tough quarter you said with weather and everything, it’s going to be a very difficult quarter, is there any reason to think that geographic mix could shift any during the first quarter?
C. Howard Nye : It’s really hard to see anything shifting in the first quarter but frankly it’s hard to see much going on in the first quarter. Contractors are not coming in to this year with an enormous book of business. Typically they are not faced with anything that may look like liquidated damages for their businesses so they don’t feel the need to get back particularly early and I think what contractors are going to do Trey is they are going to wait, as I tried to indicate in my remarks, until they really feel like they can operate incredibly efficiently and then go to work so I’m not sure you’ll see a geographic products or other type of mix change in Q1. I think those are your drivers in Q1.
Trey Grooms – Stephens, Inc.: Then my last question is could you give us an update on M&A? Last quarter you mentioned I believe it was $150 million in LOIs that you had out. Can you kind of give us a progress report there?
C. Howard Nye : While we still have a series of LOIs out, as you would imagine knowing us as well as you do, we look very carefully at what we’re contemplating buying. We’re still looking at a series of transactions, it’s unclear precisely when or if any of them will close. I will tell you there’s not a huge amount of M&A activity out there right now but that said Trey, we do continue to see a steady diet of transactions in our relevant geographic markets that to us are attractive.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Garik Shmois – Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your outlook for infrastructure spending? Ward you mentioned that really the principle risk that you see right now to your volume guidance comes from commercial construction declines but what would happen if we’re seeing the Senate convene introducing a jobs bill and suring up federal spending, what if that doesn’t materialize? What kind of risk is there to the downside?
C. Howard Nye : I guess what I would say is I don’t think there’s a huge risk of the senate really doing that to begin with. I think everyone realizes they need to go and swing at this thing. Really, this is going to be a year that is all about stimulus in many respects so if really that is going to be the focus from an infrastructure perspective, even if our government continues to operate in a certain fashion that at times it appears dysfunctional, I think we can still function we just can’t function as well as we would like.
Garik Shmois – Longbow Research: Just a question regarding the kept inventory, is it possible to give us an update of how much volumes perhaps would have to come back before you have to start booking the excess inventory that you’ve been expensing?
Anne H. Lloyd : It’s not a question of the volumes coming back on inventory that has already been capped on the ground, I mean it will be for new production out there that’s really not the relevant issue with that excess inventory, it will be sold when volumes come back probably my thought is that takes probably 18 to 24 months to get that back in to the system.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets.
John Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: I was going to ask as a follow up to that could you update us on the amount of that inventory you have for the year?
C. Howard Nye : The inventory that we have for the year is a little bit over 15 million tons, that’s up I want to say Jack about 1.5 million from prior year. Of course, part of the issue that you’re faced with from an operating perspective is one that you know well, we had a strong push to produce clean washed stone, primarily for asphalt products during the course of the year. When you’re making that you’re making products at time that you’re not going to be able to sell immediately but still products that you’re going to sell in the long term but it was that 1.5 million year-over-year delta that I think you were asking about.
John Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: I assume it’s spread over a variety of markets?
C. Howard Nye : It is Jack, it’s spread throughout the entire enterprise.
John Kasprzak – BB&T Capital Markets: Secondly it was in the press release, there’s a reference in the risk section to the 2010 outlook that the outlook is in part based on that a federal highway bill will be reauthorized. Is that as straightforward as it seems? In other words if there is no new six year bill that you guys feel like there’s downside to the volume guidance?
C. Howard Nye : I’m not sure that there’s so much downside to the guidance in ’10. In fact, that probably ends up being much more of an ’11 issue. The one thing that it does do though Jack is it does tend to constrain DOTs to undertake longer term planning for projects. So what you’re not seeing as aggressively as we would see otherwise would be good solid projects coming out of their pipeline. They may not necessarily be projects that would go this year but it does make the program run much more smoothly and efficiently.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Can you help us reconcile your prior comments on pretty limited M&A opportunities with the capacity that you’ve created on your balance sheet this quarter by renegotiating the debt covenant and also issuing a little bit of equity?
Anne H. Lloyd : Jerry, the capacity that we created on the balance sheet with the debt covenant really was in response to ensuring that we kept adequate cushion between what we anticipated to be our leverage ratio. It purely was driven by that factor as opposed to providing extra capacity to go out and issue debt. 
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Just to clarify, an answer to a prior question the $150 million of acquisitions that you were looking for a quarter ago, are those still in play or were you not able to come to terms on a good chunk of those LOIs?
C. Howard Nye : I’ll tell you Jerry, we continue to be involved in a handful of different activities. We’re obviously constrained by confidentiality agreements on those so we can’t go in to a great deal of detail about them. But again Jerry, it would be a number of some significance if we brought them all to closure and conclusion. My guess is we will not bring them all to closure or conclusion but we’re going to look at all of them very carefully and move on the ones that we think make good sense in the short term and the long term for our business.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Can you please rank order for us which regions you’re most optimistic on pricing in 2010?
C. Howard Nye : Jerry, the long and short of it is the best pricing outlook probably in 2010 is going to be in some portions of the southeast then to the southwest and then probably down the River and the Midwestern markets. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: The first question, on the guidance you talk about what kind of non-residential slowdown do you expect in those numbers?
C. Howard Nye : We’re thinking non-resi may be down in the 20%ish category. 
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: That would be among all sectors, is that correct?
C. Howard Nye : I guess the question that I’ve got is really how does non-resi look as the year goes on? Here’s the component that I would throw out there for you to ponder because we have as well and that is that I think the office and retail sector is particularly hard hit. I think the question is what does heavier industrial look like for the end of the year? Because, if we’re going to be in a deflationary cost environment for much of the year like I believe we will, at some point if you’re in the industry and you have projects, and you have financial capacity you may want to move on them. Take for example, what you see going on in infrastructure right now. Much of the infrastructure bidding work that has gone on over the last year has come in 20%, 25% and sometimes 30% below engineer’s estimates so clearly the states and governments are getting good value for the projects that they are awarding now. At some point you may see that on the heavy side so I guess our view is we see non-resi as a whole down 20%ish, we think the heavy side of that maybe not so much.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Second question, I was a little surprised with your comments earlier about a reauthorization of the highway bill, if we continue to see Congress drag its feet on this and we just get these month-to-month patches or two month patches, would that not cause volume problems sometime during the paving season in 2010?
C. Howard Nye : I’m not sure it would cause a huge issue in 2010. Again, I think ’10 in many respects is about projects that are there and about stimulus work that coming behind it. I see the reauthorization issue as a much broader long term issue.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: That wouldn’t take away some of the stimulus spending by taking away the normal spending?
C. Howard Nye : I don’t think materially so at least in ’10.
Keith Hughes – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Anne, to follow up on your comments on the debt covenants and the cushion, given the view that you’ve laid out on volume growth and profit growth, it seems as though the ratios would be coming down. I’m just a little confused by your comments as well.
Anne H. Lloyd : Keith, they will be coming down but as a reminder, we don’t have a net debt covenant and we have a maturity due in April and we’ve got the cash available to pay that off but until we pay it off it is still considered part of debt so we were trying to make sure we maintained enough cushion – we asked for a net debt covenant but were unsuccessful in achieving that so we just went for an increase in the actual leverage covenant itself.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: I want to focus on your end markets looking forward, first do you have a projection of what you think your end market mix will be in 2010 understanding that public spending will understandably be higher on a percentage basis? Then also, you just mentioned you gave your projection for non-resi being down in 20%, can you also clarify where you see public and residential for your markets in 2010?
C. Howard Nye : Kathryn, back to your first question, you see where we were in 2009, the way our business broke down. We’re not at a point where we want to project what we think that’s going to look like in 2010. Honestly, I don’t think it’s going to be remarkably different than we’ve seen in ’09 but besides from that I don’t think we can be any more specific. Going to those different buckets and giving you a sense of the movement, the way we would tally that up is I think we see infrastructure up probably around 8%. I think we think residential is likely to be up around 20%, our chem rock rail component after the [inaudible] transaction in particularly probably up around 10% and then as you referenced we had already discussed non-resi or commercial down 20%.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: Thinking about volume improvement I just wanted to see are you seeing any improvements in volumes in certain markets, particularly ones that have seen a greater relative percentage of your [inaudible] flow even directionally, any other color about that would certainly be helpful.
C. Howard Nye : Well obviously so far in ’10 there’s no color to offer anywhere but what I would tell you is really go back and take a look at what we said in Q3. With that we have seen in Iowa and the way volumes had moved there, I think what it demonstrated to us Kathryn to try and answer your question but hit something I think is even more compelling, is how powerful this business is when even varying degrees of volume come back to it with the leverage that we have over this business right now. Keeping in mind that we’re probably looking at a 60% or more incremental margin on new tonnage when it comes back in to the system. I think that’s something to be incredibly sensitive to but it’s hard for me to tell you right now in early February what markets we see coming back and what type of strength in particular we could note for you.
Kathryn Thompson – Thompson Research: But it sounds as though reasonably it really won’t be until Q2 until you see any realization of this?
C. Howard Nye : My guess is Kathryn it’s going to be April before people really go back to work in earnest. I think there are a couple of months in the aggregates business, not so much from Martin Marietta but rather for the industry that I think May is a month worth watching and I think October is always a month worth watching and October this past year as you know was a pretty miserable month in this part of the world.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, LLC.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, LLC: I had a question on North Carolina, I think you said the volumes were down in the mid 20s but if you could just cover that again? Pricing was flat there and I was curious as to your outlook in ’10 and what impact weather or other unusual things in North Carolina and particularly an update on their state situation in terms of funding?
C. Howard Nye : Well, North Carolina clearly did have a pretty ugly October as did most of the southeast United States. As you recall we break it down in to three different groups here. We have Charlotte area, we have Greensboro area and then one in Raleigh as well. Charlotte has clearly felt the economy in a very acute way. The banking industry has profoundly affected Charlotte, I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone. Greensboro, High Point, Winston and Salem, the triad has really been in more of a recession than any other major part of the state for an extending period of time now.  Raleigh you see considerably more infrastructure work in this part of the state than you do in other parts of the state. The other thing that you’re going to see this year in particular is that you are going to start see work in earnest going on on our first toll roads here in North Carolina and we have a couple of contracts on that. We feel like on the infrastructure piece of it here in North Carolina, particularly as you get to Raleigh and you move east, it’s going to be a pretty fair picture.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, LLC: In North Carolina or the company in general see increased paving work, road work which has higher margin to it? How do you see the mix playing out in your pricing guidance for ’10?
C. Howard Nye : You know what, the interesting thing on the mix is mix isn’t really a driver on margins for us. Mix ends up being an issue really more for you when you’re tallying up ASP at the end of a quarter, for us really the margin that we would make on base or the margin that we would make on cleaned washed stone isn’t remarkably different but the ASP for those products can be remarkably different. If you’re moving from product to product even within a geography it can move as much as 20% to 40%. You can have that same type of movement on the same product from different geography to different geography. So will we see different products going this year as stimulus is more mature? Yes, we probably will. Will we see more base going in some jurisdictions than we did last year? Yes, we probably will. Is that base a lower priced product? Yes. Is that going to affect margin? No, it’s not. One thing that it is going to do for us is it is going to help us keep our planets in remarkably better balance because clearly you’re making a host of products as you’re trying to meet the asphalt needs anyway. So I think we will see the mix shift around a little bit. I’m not sure from a profit perspective or from where you sit that matters. I think it does optically relative to ASPs.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, LLC: My last question was on residential, you said up 20%. Can you help us again understand where the demand from aggregates comes relative to the timing of a housing start? I guess my concern or question really is, how much development work has been done already where home builders are waiting to build homes but you’ve already laid out the Cul de Sac with the aggregates? How does that all timing wise happen? And, help us with the 20% number.
C. Howard Nye : I’ll give you a sense of the way it works and then I’ll let you do your math, how about that. As a practical matter about half of what we sell to residential is going to find its way in to the subdivisions. If we’re looking at, let’s use easy math, say it’s 10% resi, 5% of that is going to go in to the streets, curb, gutter, water, sewer, etc. and the other 5% to your point is going to find its way in to the structure.  So really what you’re needing to do to get a sense of it is how are these different communities in the southeast and southwest looking from a maturity or absorption perspective. Because if they’re building new homes and bulldozers are going in then we’re going to be on the front end of that and we’re going to put more in to it. To your point, if they have put in all the roads, all the infrastructure and all they need to do is build the houses then basically half of it is already done from our perspective.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ted Grace – Avondale Partners. 
Ted Grace – Avondale Partners: My first question would be on fourth quarter pricing, could you just comment on the reported number relative to where your expectations would have been kind of intra quarter, beginning of the quarter and even in January. Was there any deviation? I’d say based on my interpretation of guidance and I think clearly the stock’s reaction, I think the market looking for something better than -1, so I was just wondering if you could clarify that point at first?
C. Howard Nye : I think we’ve been pretty clear that pricing was becoming more and more challenged. I don’t think this is a huge surprise. That’s really going back to the first question that I tried to address with Ernie because I don’t see what’s happening here is this remarkable dislocation. I think what you have are some very discreet issues that are primarily driven by our long haul and distance markets.  If I go through and tally up the different markets that we’re in and then in my own mind the way I think a snap shot of it is there are about 21 different markets that I look at as I’m determining how price moves. I can tell you that in the vast majority of those I see green numbers as opposed to red numbers. So if I want to give you at least some direction on where it is, that would certainly give you a sense of it. Again, if you took Florida and River out of that, those clearly skewed it and even if I said, if you were able to do nothing more than capture the transportation costs in River, you’re back flat. 
Ted Grace – Avondale Partners: Just in terms of one of the things that we’ve talked about from time-to-time is kind of competitive behavior. You had one competitor with a lot of geographic overlap that reported -9 pricing. I was just wondering if you have any comments on just seeing more discipline in the market? If it’s more the status quo or any change in that regard?
C. Howard Nye : You know what, I don’t see remarkable changes. As we’ve said, it is very competitive, there are a number of players who are playing for some cash costs right now and they have been very clear about that and I think you can look at the numbers in these different market areas and have a pretty good feel for how that works.
Ted Grace – Avondale Partners: Then the last question would just be, on the M&A side, I guess my sense as I think about Steve’s philosophy on M&A was real kind of focus on the upstream side of the business, Ward any reason to think you may have a different philosophy or greater appetite to consider the downstream side of the business?
C. Howard Nye : Well, I’ll tell you what, I’m an aggregate guy at heart so I’ll begin my comments with that. My aim and the company’s aim is to be in what we feel like are attractive long term markets and we want to be in a number one or number two market position in those markets. What we feel and what we believe is that aggregates is the common denominator in all the different products and that is where we want to be. I’ll answer your question this way, if someone comes to us and they tell us that they have a fantastic ready mix business for sale but it doesn’t have an aggregate component to it, we’re probably not that interested in it. On the other hand if somebody has a very attractive aggregate business and it may have appended to it an attractive downstream business that’s probably something that we’re going to look at.  Now, whether we maintain that downstream business after the transaction, that’s another question and another set of analysis but that’s really the take that we have. One last thing that I would offer to you is as you look at downstream businesses, no one has mentioned it but I’ll take what we have in mag specialties day in day out over ready mix business or a hot mix business today.
Ted Grace – Avondale Partners: But the opportunity to expand that on the acquisitions front is probably less, right? It would be more kind of organic product growth?
C. Howard Nye : That is entirely correct, but we do recognize that.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Clyde Lewis – Citi.
Clyde Lewis – Citi: I think I’ve just got one left is I may, just coming back to [inaudible] and the renewal process there. Can you just say a little more about the timing? You’ve actually alluded to a renewal in 2010, I mean what are the sort of dangers that goes through in to 2011? But, also if you can talk a little bit about sort of what sort of scale it could end up being?
C. Howard Nye : Clyde I think the good news and bad news about that is it seems to change pretty regularly to be honest. Here’s what I suppose we believe Clyde. From a timing perspective the administration has always been clear, they wanted from the get go an 18 month extension to that. Our guess is when the Senate and others come back they’ll probably extend what we have until the end of the year. I think the other thing that people recognize is that they have to find a way to pay for whatever is next and as a practical matter the way to pay for that is likely going to be through a gas tax or some point of user fee. That’s going to be a pretty unattractive prospect for them to consider prior to midterm elections. Our guess is Clyde, what you’ll see is some serious movement after the midterms. I think in any event whatever happens with that this year really doesn’t have a profound effect whatsoever.  I think it’s going to matter to a degree in ’11 only because it puts states in a position where they can start planning more meaningfully because right now they can’t. Actually, they’re very clear in telling us and in telling their elected representatives that they can’t do that and their hands are tied.
Clyde Lewis – Citi: In terms of scale, I mean again there’s obvious still so much to play for and post midterms everything could change a fair bit but the sort of $450 billion to $500 billion that was thought to have been the upper end, do you think that’s a pipedream now?
C. Howard Nye : I’m not sure that’s a pipedream. I think everyone understands that the infrastructure is tired, I think everyone understands they have to find a way to create jobs and if the administration and others don’t recognize that really that’s what this is all about at this point then they’re missing what was a very clear message the people of Massachusetts surprisingly sent the other week. My guess is that’s likely to be what we’ll see and a bill in that mid four range I don’t think Clyde is out of the realm of possibility whatsoever.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Christopher Manuel – Keybanc Capital Markets. 
Christopher Manuel – Keybanc Capital Markets: A couple of questions for you, I know this is incredibly difficult to do but could you maybe give us some sense of what your thoughts from 2009 what you had from stimulus orientated aggregates volume and what in your 2010 assumption of stimulus component to volumes would look like within there?
C. Howard Nye : You know what Chris, I don’t know that we could really break it down for you at this instant to give you a snap shot of entirely what that looks like and as you said, that’s a pretty difficult thing to look at and try to capture. Honestly, I’m not sure for 2010 how much it really matters. I hate to say that but I think in large part that volume component is going to be what that volume component is going to be and whether it is funded from stimulus or whether it’s funded from the normal programs I don’t think that particularly matters.
Christopher Manuel – Keybanc Capital Markets: That’s a good point but what I’m more I guess trying to get after is as you look out 2011, 2012 and some of those programs begin to roll off, ideally the new highway bill would augment or pick up some of where that left off but how do you view that as a risk as you look out over the next couple of years?
C. Howard Nye : Chris, I agree with that. I think we do need to have a highway bill for the long term to provide stability there. I think the other thing that is worth thinking about too and while we’re the first to say you’re going to see most of stimulus spend in 2010, there’s likely to be more spent in ’11 and maybe a dribble over in to ’12 than people would have thought. Back to the point we made a little while ago and that is projects are being bid 20%, to 25% to 30% below engineer’s estimates.  The fact is they’re going to have more money and be able to push it through more projects and go farther than they thought they would have in the first instance. That’s going to give us a nice tailwind even ex the highway bill going in to ’11 and in to ’12 but your point is not missed. We do need that highway bill and there’s no question about that.
Christopher Manuel – Keybanc Capital Markets: Is it your impression, and I recognize this is a moving target as well but, is it your impression that the next component of a bill will likely be able to pick up that incremental $25ish billion a year above and beyond where [inaudible] was to keep that level intact?
C. Howard Nye : It’s tough to say Chris but I think you can certainly come up with the math to answer that question yes and I don’t think it’s a stretch.
Christopher Manuel – Keybanc Capital Markets: The last question I had was as you look at what you’re doing this year with pricings, a couple points is very important but as you think about inflation, clearly as we look today diesel costs would appear to be above where we were as an average last year. I know you guys have done an outstanding job and I commend you for what you’ve done getting cost out of the system, as you look at 2010 do you think that you’ve over the past few years some significant net price move. Do you think putting in to balance inflation and what you’ve got in price that you’ll be able to maintain at least a neutral position in 2010?
C. Howard Nye : I’d like to think we will and in large part because we always find a way on the cost side to keep tackling and I think we will continue to do that Chris. I have to commend the operating team in this organization here on the call because they have ton absolutely a fantastic job so I think we will be able to continue to tackle that with effectiveness. The other thing that you have to believe happens at some point is some degree of volume comes back to this. Again Chris, to imagine not losing market share, and I don’t believe we’ve lost market share but we’ve seen 80 million tons just go away because that is what the market has done. I think the conversation perhaps you and I have had in the past before, if we simply recovery half of that volume that we’ve lost, with the cost structure that we have without making huge moves in pricing we can be back to record profitability.  So I think it’s really taking the cost structure that we have, recognizing price is going to come back when some degree of volume comes back but still the leverage is what I’m focused on in this instant because I think it is just so powerful.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin Bennett – Davenport & Company.
Kevin Bennett – Davenport & Company: The first question is on the specialty product segment, you guys have done a great job of getting the gross margins kind of in the low to mid 30s, it looks like your 2010 guidance is kind of in that range as well. Looking past 2010, is that level sustainable? Can you provide some color on that or your thoughts about that?
C. Howard Nye : I don’t see anything that makes that not sustainable for that business. Our operating team there has again, done a great job beginning with costs first. At the same time we’ve moved more and more in to the specialty products. The component of it that is most cyclical is the steel component of it and really that’s going to be about 30%ish of that. So you do have to stay focused on that directionally to get a feel for it. With that said, we’ve been very careful to move that business in to different products that have the type of scope and growth to them that we would like to have for the long term and we think that business is positioned remarkably well not just for next year but for a good long run.
Kevin Bennett – Davenport & Company: Second question, you mentioned in the release this morning that you thought SG&A would be flat this year excluding some pension contributions. Can you provide an amount to that or just some comments on that?
Anne H. Lloyd : Yes, our SG&A costs this year we do think will be flat excluding those onetime costs. We do have some supplemental retirement plans here that we’ll have to do to payout an accrual of costs related to those this year.
Kevin Bennett – Davenport & Company: Can you comment on the magnitude of those contributions?
Anne H. Lloyd : Well, the total pension contribution this year is expected to be about $35 million in cash with $20 million in the normal recurring pension contribution about $15 for some other payouts under that supplemental plan. I think the expense will translate in to about $5 million.
Kevin Bennett – Davenport & Company: My last question, kind of following on to what Chris was talking about earlier with the pricing growth, looking longer term in to 2011 and 2012 as volumes do come back what are you looking for in terms of year-over-year pricing growth out there? Do you think you can get back to the mid to high single digits or anything you can comment on looking farther out than 2010 would be helpful.
C. Howard Nye : The farther out we get the tougher it is today. Realistically looking out a year or two the volume is what matters. I mean you nailed it, some degree of volumes comes back, pricing in the four, five, six in that mid single digits range is not something that I feel like is a huge stretch at all to see that consistently throughout. I think really as you have a longer term form of recovery, you might see better than that but I think realistically in the time frame that you’re talking about provided you have some tailwind with volume, I don’t think that’s unrealistic.
Operator:  With no further questions in the queue I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nye for any closing remarks.
C. Howard Nye : Thank you again for joining us today and for your interest in Martin Marietta. I think it’s not secret to anyone that 2009 was a challenging year but as I believe you know, despite the year’s many headwinds we made money in 2009 and importantly we did it by managing the near term but not sacrificing the long term. Accordingly, I want to make sure I congratulate our team for a job well done in 2009 and I want to ensure our shareholders of our total commitment to do it again and all the while be in a position to avail ourselves of market opportunities as they become available. We’ll speak to you again at the end of Q1. Thank you all very much.
Operator:  That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator:   Good day everyone and welcome to this Martin Marietta Materials Incorporated fourth quarter 2008, full year financial results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Zelnak. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Zelnak: Thanks for joining us on a beautiful sunny day in Raleigh, North Carolina. I have with me Howard Nye, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Anne Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter was extremely challenging as we coped with a 21% volume reduction in our aggregates business, along with a sharp contraction in lime demand to the steel industry in our specialty products business. The volume downturn in aggregates was partially mitigated by a 9% pricing improvement, along with about $8 million in reduced diesel fuel expenditures as energy prices trended down.  We also experienced down aggregates volume in all areas except northwest Louisiana and Arkansas, which were driven primarily by energy related projects. Granite shipments into Florida also increased as contractors prepared for the beginning of a $1.4 billion highway work from the accelerated Florida initiative.  Shipment volumes were particularly weak in North Carolina and South Carolina, which were down over 30% and Atlanta which saw a volume drop close to 50%. During the quarter, we continued to manage our cost effectively, which produced earnings per diluted share of $0.80, prior to $0.20 in nonrecurring charges.  Severance charges accounted for $0.08 as we reduced our workforce consistent with the decline in business. The remaining nonrecurring charges were for resolution of a royalty dispute, property losses and a write-down related to structural composites products.  SG&A expenses declined $2 million or 6% during the quarter. For the year, SG&A expense was down $3.8 million and was 8.1% of net sales versus 7.9% in 2007, with sales decreasing 5%. For the year, earnings per diluted share of $4.20 included the $0.20 in nonrecurring charges as well as a gain of $0.24 per diluted share on the sale of quarries and our transaction with Vulcan Materials.  Aggregates volume was down 13% while pricing improved 7%. Specialty products results were reduced $3.3 million for the structural composite write-down as well as well as by the sharp fourth quarter in lime shipments. Although energy was cost was positive in the fourth quarter, our results were reduced by $0.43 a share for the high energy prices that prevailed most of the year.  Even though it was a difficult year, we continued to generate excellent cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities was $342 million in spite of a net income drop of $87 million for the year. Control of working capital, coupled with lower cash taxes and the benefits from bonus depreciation deductions, were beneficial to cash flow.  With respect to liquidity, in December 2008, we refinanced our expiring $200 million of 5.875% notes through our revolving credit facility, effectively converting the fixed rate notes to a floating rate, which is currently LIBOR plus 225 basis points. We expect this to reduce interest expense in 2009 by about $3 million. We expect to take some further actions that will improve our liquidity to assure we are fully funded for upcoming debt obligations along with being prepared to take advantage of some possible acquisition opportunities.  As we look at 2009, our current view is a weak first half with some growth opportunity in the second half, fueled primarily by passage of an economic stimulus package. Current spending numbers appear to be in the $30 billion range for highways plus $15 billion to $18 billion for transit and airports. We firmly believe the states are ready to move quickly on this level of work, with notable impact on our business in the second half of 2009 and into 2010.  We’re also encouraged that attention is being given to significantly more funding for transportation in the follow-on Transportation Act, which will replace the current program that expires in September 2009.  For 2009, we expect volumes will be down 9% to 12%, excluding the impact of the stimulus package. The rate of price increase for the aggregates product line is expected to be 4% to 6%, which reflects increased competition based on lower capacity utilization. We expect our specialty product segment to contribute a record $32 million to $35 million in pretax earnings. We also anticipate $35 million to $50 million in energy cost reductions.  Given these assumptions, we currently expect net earnings per diluted share to be $3.70 to $4.30, excluding the stimulus package. If the stimulus package is passed with approximately $30 billion in highway expenditures in the program that could add $0.50 to $0.75 per diluted share.  At this time, I’d be pleased to take any questions that you may have.
Questions-and-Answers:  
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Arnie Ursaner with CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Hey Steve, how are you?
Stephen Zelnak: Hey, Arnie.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: And good afternoon to you Anne, as well.
Anne Lloyd: Hello Arnie.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: My question is, can you give us a little bit of a feel for the shape of the volume decline you saw in Q4, meaning several of your quarries I’m assuming shut down fairly early in the quarter and where I’m going with that is, can you also perhaps comment on how that might translate to when we would see some pickup in activity in Q1? I know you’ve generally spoken broadly about Q1 in your view being essentially non-existent. So can you kind of walk us through the monthly pattern of the trends you’re seeing?
Stephen Zelnak: Well, the trends obviously were sharply down in the quarter with a 21% volume decline. What we chose to do was to make sure that we did not build inventory. We actually produced in line with our sales, so we cut back very sharply on production.  With that, it said to us that we needed to shut plants down early and based on the outlook in the first half of 2009 that we’re going to need to keep those plants down much longer than normal and in some cases we may have some plants that don’t come up all year where we will serve that business out of existing stockpiles as well as supplement it from other nearby locations. So we’re very focused on the balance between sales and production. If you look at our year, we actually brought down inventory by about 3.7 million tons. The inventory valuation went up because of the increased cost, but we scaled the volume back, which is a pretty substantial volume decline.  So we won’t be producing at very high rates. Certainly not in Q1 and if you think back to prior Q1s, certainly going back to 2006 and ‘07 which were incredibly good years, we were producing at very high rates because of demand. So we’ll have a very little production to amortize costs again.  I’ll reiterate the comment; the first quarter is going to be pretty non-existent. The weather’s been tough and on top of that, there’s just very limited demand out there. There’s no reason for a contractor to go to work early. Hopefully that helps. 
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: That’s very helpful. My second question relates a little more generally. You have one very highly visible public competitor where your views are quite different in terms of quantification and outlook for 2009. Perhaps you could comment a little bit on your view of where you think you may differ from your leading competitor in aggregates, in terms of the outlook for ‘09?
Stephen Zelnak: Well, obviously we’re looking at what other people put out and always read with interest. There is a disparity in views with respect to volume. If I recall, you’re referring to Vulcan; I think their volume outlook was 5% to 10%, we’re 9% to 12%, so we expect a further volume decline.  We operate in a lot of the same areas, but not in all the same areas. So the big difference would be the presence in California that they have which we do not, and a much larger presence in Florida that they have. We have a small presence, focusing on the granite market. So I would assume that they have a positive outlook for California and a positive outlook for Florida to get to that forecast, but I’m just speculating.  With respect to pricing, their forecast for pricing is higher than ours. Again, it may relate to those markets. I would think in the markets where we’re both in the same place, it’s going to be pretty similar. That’s probably the best I can do on that one.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: In Q4, the southeast had 16% pricing improvement versus high single digit for the year. I’m assuming that’s just mix?
Stephen Zelnak: It was very much mix. It relates to the decline in volume in the Carolinas or in Georgia, Atlanta in particular and the decline in volume of truck business relative to what was pretty good business with long haul transportation. So you’re trading off tons on long haul, you got tons that are selling for say $20 a ton and in the truck market half that. So it is a mix issue. By no stretched imagination do we increase prices by double digits in the southeast.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you sir and we’ll take our next question from Jack Kasprzak from BB&T Capital Markets.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.
Stephen Zelnak: Hey, Jack.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. I was wondering if you guys could give us an estimate for the tax rate for ‘09 and interest expense.
Anne Lloyd: Jack, this is Anne. We expect the tax rate for ‘09 to be 30% and right now assuming current interest rates and our current mix of fixed to floating, we would say that interest expense would come in around $70 million next year.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: And with regard to SG&A which Steve you mentioned in your prepared comments was down in absolute dollars for the full year, you think it can be down again in absolute dollars in ‘09?
Stephen Zelnak: Yes. That certainly is the expectation.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: And you mentioned the potential impact from the stimulus package, 8 million to 10 million tons for you guys, which seems consistent with a forecast that had been on your website for a while, but the stimulus package as it appears today is about $30 billion for highways. Unless I’m mistaking, the initial estimate was maybe that it might be $50 billion to $70 billion for highways; am I not squaring the two estimates correctly?
Stephen Zelnak: What we’ve done is gone back and done a little revision, Jack. The number is that correlated with the 50. We had a much lower market share than the actual numbers. I think we used the 6% number, the number is close to 7.5% and we used the figure of 10,000 tons per $1 million.  I think that number’s going to be higher. So expectation is that the 8 million to 10 million tons looks to us to be a pretty good number and that essentially divides the tonnage up into one third of it coming in the latter half of ‘09 and the rest of it coming in 2010.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Steve, you mentioned also in your comments that you thought there was more attention being given to higher transportation funding in the next highway bill. Were you referring to anything in particular that’s occurred recently or just a general feeling that a Democratic regime is more friendly than highway spending?
Stephen Zelnak: No, there’s some proposals floating around. Probably the baseline proposal is to look at increasing the gas tax on an inflation basis, running it forward from the last increase at the federal level in 1993 to 2009 or 2010, whenever they actually get this done. That could be pretty significant numbers. You may be looking at roughly $0.15 a gallon and it’s about $0.001 equal, about $2 billion. So we think there’s an opportunity, we think there is some real appetite, and I’ll tell you what gets my attention. This administration is clearly focused on job creation. This Congress, it has to be focused on it if they want to be re-elected in 2010. You’ve got an infrastructure program that’s going to be put out there, certainly appears that it will very shortly. If you do not have a follow on that maintains at a similar level, those jobs are going away.  So I think there’s going to be a tremendous amount of pressure on the Congress to have a follow on that perpetuates the jobs and then with that, they would be hoping to see economic recovery which would take it forward even more. That’s what gives me some optimism.  I actually like the structure of what has been put out there, as opposed to some very large overwhelming number that removes the problem for a while. I think this just refocuses people on what has to be done with the renewal.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Great, thanks for that. That’s it from me.
Stephen Zelnak: Sure.
Operator: Thank you and we’ll take our next question from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Hi, good afternoon.
Stephen Zelnak: Hey. 
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: The first question is on your pricing guidance, how much of that is dependent on opportunities you might see in the middle of the year once you get a little bit more visibility I guess from the stimulus package?
Stephen Zelnak: Essentially none; we have a couple of places where we think we may have modest mid year opportunities, but we do not believe that given the economic environment and given the cost environment that there would be much of an opportunity to look at mid-year price increases.  So pricing we have put into effect, reflects prices that are either already in effect as of January 1 or will be by April 1, but some of the markets are different in terms of timing as to when we put them in and reflects a little carryover from mid year price increases that were put into effect in 2008.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay, thanks and on commercial construction, do you have a forecast on what you’re using as far as demand for this year?
Stephen Zelnak: Yes, we think it’s going to be an ugly non-residential market in 2009. We’ve recently relooked it as we tried to formulate our volume forecast for the year. Expectation is that we’re going to see volume declines there overall that probably are in the 12% to 15% range. It will be very severe with respect to office and retail. I would expect those numbers are going to be 30ish. Then when you get to capacity driven projects, I think the decline there would be very modest.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay, thanks for that and just lastly, I think at the end of the last quarter, you talked about the North Carolina Tollway initiatives that were set to get underway at the end of ‘08 or early ‘09. Can you just provide an update on those? Are you still seeing those on schedule or have those been pushed out?
Stephen Zelnak: Pushed out a little bit based on the ability to place the bonds. The first project’s already been let. The timing on letting the other projects, I haven’t seen any slippage in, which will be two projects in ‘09, another project in 2010.  What the toll North Carolina Turnpike Authority is trying to figure out the timing on, is the placement of those bonds. They have indicated publicly that they hope to place those bonds in the first quarter and frankly in terms of work actually getting done, there wasn’t anything that was going to be done anyway over the winter to any great degree. So hopefully we’ll get those placed in the quarter and that projects will get underway in Q4. That’s the project in Raleigh, by the way.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Right. Thanks for the update.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good afternoon. 
Stephen Zelnak: Hey, Chris. 
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: A couple of questions for you; first, could you just maybe run us through, just maybe if you’d update us on the percent of your business coming from the different markets; how it ended the year, residential public works, private non-res, etc? And you’ve given us a little bit of an update on where you thought 2009 would be for the private non-res side. Could you fill in the pieces for the remainder as well?
Stephen Zelnak: I’ll take a crack at some of it. We’re not ready to give you the end-use markets yet. We’re still working our way through that. We do that compilation once a year and we’ll provide that a little bit later. As we look at 2009, I’ve already talked about non-res which we think is pretty ugly. Expectation at the infrastructure market is going to be down probably mid-single digit. I’m perhaps a lot more optimistic about housing than most people. The qualifier on that was that I was bearish, while other people were still bullish. So I might be right, might not, but I’ve got a somewhat different view.  My expectation would be that we will see a bottoming of housing probably third quarter and that we’ll begin to see a little bit of activity. The understanding is that in the stimulus bill as it is being put together, that the $15,000 tax credit has been stripped out, but that the $7,500 and we’ll have to see if this is the actual language, becomes a credit or some type of recovery as opposed to a loan. I want to see what that really is. So anything there I think is going to be helpful.  Most of the houses that need to move are houses that are priced at less than $500,000, you can get conforming the loans on those houses. The interest rates are pretty attractive, and as you know home prices have come down sharply; they’re still coming down. My expectation is by the middle of the year, you’re going to have pricing in the home market that’s pretty attractive for those people who are qualified buyers.  On top of that, if the home builders are going to stay in business even at the modest levels out there, they’re going to have to start to develop some more subdivision properties and I don’t expect that to just break loose, but I do expect to see some activity for the first time in well over two years. So I’m a bit more positive about that. I would expect housing demand for us to be down this year, but probably modestly based on that subdivision component, if I’m correct there.  One differentiator between us and other companies is the other category of business. About 10% of our aggregates business falls outside building construction and we think that 10%, which is railroad ballast, flue gas desulfurization stone and agricultural lime is going to be flattish, plus or minus a little bit. That would be our view of the world as we look at ‘09 and that’s how we come to the 9% to 12% and that big number is driven heavily by non-res.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay and then that infrastructure piece you talked about down mid-single digits; that’s not taking into account stimulus?
Stephen Zelnak: That’s correct. 
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: One of the challenges that I wrestle with is thinking about, as we look at all the state budgets and local municipality budgets and public private partnerships, etc, that are all seemingly under so much pressure and hearing of projects being delayed, put on hold, waiting for the stimulus piece to be passed is trying to figure out what is incremental.  When we look at that $30 billion in that proposed stimulus piece of incremental for infrastructure and another $90 billion I think in total for all these different projects. How could you help us maybe think about that as to what is incremental, what is effectively going to be less pocket, federal government replacing, right pocket local state sort of funding?
Stephen Zelnak: I would say to you that I don’t think it makes a difference. Because what we’re trying to give you is a forecast that is based on the condition of the states we’re in as they stand today without stimulus. So whether it turns out to be replacement or some other projects really doesn’t make a difference. We’re trying to baseline it.  So whatever comes out of the stimulus program is incremental to that volume that we would expect to do. Doesn’t make any difference which project it goes on, it’s going to be incremental tonnage running through our plant versus what we expect to have come without it and we’ve been pretty explicit in terms of laying out those expectations, the 8 million to 10 million tons in 2009. That’s not been done without a lot of thought and we’ve laid out a margin expectation, too. I’ll tell you how we did that, because we’ve had some questions on it.  Pretty straight forward, we’re running at very low levels of capacity, roughly 65% of capacity utilization. Incremental tons coming through our plants right now are going to be 50% incremental margin at a minimum.  So if you take a $10 aggregate price, which is actually understated for us, you put a 50% margin with that, which I think is low end expectation and then put that with 8 million tons and 10 million tons, you’re going to get an EPS that pops out the back end, an incremental number of $0.67 to $0.82. We framed it as $0.50 to $0.75. So that’s the math, the assumptions goes with that for us.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. Then just one last housekeeping question or a couple housekeeping questions for Anne. In the press release, you talked about pension expense being up in ‘09. Can you tell us what the assumption is for both on the expense, the differential year-over-year and also the cash funding?
Anne Lloyd: Yes. The cash funding needs will range from $7.5 million to $36 million, with a best estimate today of around $20 million and the incremental cost, the number, it’s doubling and I head it’s going up to $36 million.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: What is your free cash estimate for the year that corresponds to your EPS guidance?
Anne Lloyd: Corresponding to the EPS guidance, assuming the $185 million in CapEx, we’re looking at free cash flow around $150 million to $175 million excluding the stimulus.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Will Greene - Stephens Inc.: Good afternoon. This is Will Greene on the line for Trey. I wanted to expand on cost reduction if I could. What kind of cost reduction do you expect from the workforce that you reduced in Q4 and how much of that is going to be in SG&A versus COGS?
Stephen Zelnak: The SG&A component of it and it’s not just people, it’s a lot of services too that we scrubbed pretty hard, could range up on the order of $8 million to $10 million is what we’re looking at there. On the hourly side of the equation, based on demand out there, we’ve got more that we’re looking at there to match up with demand. A lot of it’s not necessarily people reduction, it’s that we will have a lot of people who will be working light hours for the year, because they’re simply not going to be called back to work.  So it’s hard for me to give you a number there. We’ve got a bottoms up forecast plant by plant that we built and that’s rolled up into a cost of goods sold. I wouldn’t try to give you a number per se on hourly workers coming out.
Will Greene - Stephens Inc.: Okay and then on the margin compression, it looks like if you exclude the one times, it was mostly a volume issue. Can you remind us what the cost structure looks like right now for fixed versus variable, mainly fixed costs being DD&A and labor.
Anne Lloyd: Yes, your fixed costs are in that about a third of total costs Will. That really hasn’t changed a lot, but you’re talking about DD&A and some other property tax costs, insurance cost, etc.
Will Greene - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Well, I appreciate it. That’s all I had.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Todd Vencil with Davenport.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Thanks guys. Good afternoon.
Stephen Zelnak: Hey, Todd.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: A couple of things. Just to clarify something on that last bit. Is that greater pension expense this year running through SG&A?
Anne Lloyd: It’ll match the employee; it’ll go through either COGS or SG&A depending on where the employee is. It’s going to be pretty well split between the two.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Okay, I got it. Steve, with regard to pricing, is there any market right now where you’re seeing prices starting to fall off?
Stephen Zelnak: There are markets where we’ve got certainly more pressure than others. I indicated that Atlanta’s the market where volume was up about 50% in the fourth quarter. Atlanta is a market that has a lot of price pressure.  Our expectation is that we’re going to see a very modest improvement in pricing, but its split between sizes and material. If you’re in the market for base material in Atlanta, based on that soft granite there, there’s an abundance of base material and you may well buy that at a lesser price than you paid in ‘08, but you’re going to pay more for clean stone, would be the expectation.  So I would cite Atlanta as being a highly competitive market right now. If you get up into the North Central area, the automotive belt, also highly competitive, those are the two most competitive markets that I can think of at this point.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Okay, so still in Atlanta for instance, you feel like the average is going to remain rising?
Stephen Zelnak: Yes. I think we’re going to be up a little bit and in fact, every one of our markets is budgeted up, anywhere from modestly to in some cases higher single digits. We certainly have no double digit increases in our plan anywhere.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: And then Anne, on the debt, you spoke a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, but just looking out maybe to the end of 2010, what are you looking at for maturities and what are your covenants?
Anne Lloyd: The only covenant we have is 3.25 times debt to EBITDA with the exception of 3.5 times for 180 days post an acquisition and the maturity schedule we have $225 million in April 2010 and $250 million in April of 2011.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Thanks for that and then with the comment there on the covenant, you sort of segued me in. Steve as I recall, back in the third quarter, you guys spent a fair amount of money on professional fees, looking at what may or may not have been a deal that obviously didn’t come off. Is there any chance that that thing resurrects itself or otherwise are you seeing anything interesting in the market that’s available now that hasn’t been in the past?
Stephen Zelnak: We think it’s a very interesting time and as I’m sure you know, we haven’t been active in the acquisition market to any great degree since 2002 after an eight year run where we did 62 of them. We weren’t enamored of the pricing. You’re at a point now where there may be reasonably motivated sellers. You’re clearly not going to be buying off of peak earnings and I don’t think we’re going to be paying double digit EBITDAs.  So, that gets a lot more interesting and we happen to be in a position where we could take advantage of that and we are looking. There are a number of things out there that are for sale. We are an active looker. We will likely be an active proposer or bidder on a few things and we may land on something that’s interesting, but I’ve kind of defined what the metrics won’t be on it. So, I think if in fact we do something, it will be interesting for our shareholders.  Limited competition out there right now because of the variability balance sheet on the part of most employers. It’s tough to get out from under those 10 to 12 times EBITDA off the peak earnings that some of the guys paid.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Fair enough. All right, thanks guys.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Kathryn Thompson with Avondale.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Thank you very much? What are your debt and free cash flow targets for fiscal ‘09?
Anne Lloyd: Kathryn, I mean we talked about free cash flow earlier, about $150 million to $175 million of free cash flow after $185 million of CapEx. We’ll see what incrementally gets added if we’re fortunate at the $0.50 to $0.75 from the stimulus that would contribute another $20 million to $30 million of free cash flow. You’re wanting to keep your debt-to-EBITDA targets within the covenant and we would anticipate by the end of the year assuming these projections hold true, that we would be substantially below the 3 times level.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Tagging along with the acquisition question, what is your thought process for how you’d fund an acquisition, yet still keep a fairly clean balance sheet? In other words, how willing would you be to fund the acquisition with equity?
Stephen Zelnak: It comes down to the deal and the reality is that if you’re going to do something now of any size, you’re going to have to do it with equity, certainly a significant majority in equity. We’ve had a lot of express support from some of our major shareholder with respect to the possibility of wanting to fund something like that. There seems to be interest.  I think there certainly is a sense that there may be some good opportunities. If we see it, then obviously we’re going to calculate it based on the amount of equity that we would have to put out there to do it. As we look at the deal if it looks attractive, then we’re not going to be reluctant to step forward if we think it’s something that works both short term and long term. It’s not going to be one of these deals where it works three or four years out. It’s going to have to work in the short term too.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Perfect. As far as pricing, did the pricing at the end of the quarter vary at all from your average pricing throughout the quarter; and if you could talk about any type of pricing trends that have changed since the quarter end.
Stephen Zelnak: No significant variation in the quarter relative to normal quarterly trends. So there was nothing there and as we come into 2009, we’ve articulated what we expect and we really haven’t seen anything that changes our views there.  As I indicated earlier, we put our price increases into effect for most of what we’re going to do January 1. We’ve got some places where they may stretch out as far as April 1, based on the individual market, but the customers know what those are, and we have reached agreement. I don’t want to expect any surprises there.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: One additional question I forgot to ask on the acquisition side. Who is your competition for acquisitions? Is it mainly private players or is it also publics, if you could give some sense on the type of people that are competing for these properties that are up for sale?
Stephen Zelnak: Well, certainly private equity folks are back looking. Different sizes of firms that have any interest in our kind of business. You have a few public firms that potentially could get into the mix. It will be a question as to whether or not they have the will and whether or not they have the ability to get synergies, I think.  One of the advantages that we have is that when we look at something, we’re typically able to get better synergies than other people. I can say that with reasonable conviction, having gone through a lot of these exercises, in some cases with other players where we may have been jointly looking at the possibility of buying something together or splitting it up or JV or whatever. Our synergy numbers and synergy capabilities seem to be far in excess of anybody that we’ve seen out there. It comes back to our systems; it comes back to the management approach.  So you can look at the balance sheets of the public players and you know very quickly which ones can play and which ones can’t. It’s a very limited number and frankly if you go back in our history, when we started acquiring heavily going back to 1994 when we came out in public, it was a similar situation where there were only a couple people out there who were in a position to bid because the balance sheets were bloody coming off the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. So we actually liked the environment. 
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Okay. Just to reconfirm, so that would imply that some larger, private players wouldn’t have as much dry powder as you for making a meaningful acquisition?
Stephen Zelnak: I think we can be competitive with the large private players, put it that way, in terms of the size of the deals that are likely to be out there and particularly in terms of ability to manage them and generate a return.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Okay and just touching on a topic you talked about earlier, just to re-clarify, so for your stimulus calculations you’re using an incremental and not a normalized margin for that? 
Stephen Zelnak: That is correct.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: I want to make sure I’m clear on that subject and if you could just explain one more time why you use incremental versus normalized?
Stephen Zelnak: Okay. What we’ve given you is a normalized forecast, which is the 9% to 12% down volume, the pricing and the earnings estimates that go with that. So we’ve taken the fact that the states are going to have down programs without stimulus and we’ve impacted our volume estimate with it. So that is your new baseline.  From that baseline, the stimulus program will create additional tons and those tons are going to be incremental to that baseline. So in order to put it with the baseline earnings that we’ve given you, what we’ve tried to do is to estimate both the tons and I’ve taken you through the calculation of what we think that will yield in terms of earnings and it is an incremental yield right, because those are new tons outside of our forecast.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Okay, thank you. I missed a portion of those comments. I was just cut off, thanks for going through that again. Then my final question is on the status of the state budgets, particularly state DOTs going into their fiscal year in July really fiscal year ’10, what is your sense of where state budgets on the DOT side stand and how has that impacted your forecast?
Stephen Zelnak: It’s impacted it in a negative way, because certainly we think the revenues for the states without stimulus are going to be down. Another part of that is that the cost of construction for the states is going to be down, too. Contracting capacity is readily available. You’re seeing very aggressive bids. Fuel has come down, and contractors consume a lot of fuel, don’t underestimate that on the work they do.  Liquid asphalt is down. Essentially all materials are down, with the exception of the aggregate hanging in there at modest increases. So, the states are going to get much more of a bargain on any construction activity they do, but they’re going to have fewer dollars to do it with. So, even with that decreased cost, we think the reduced dollars against that decreased cost takes you down mid single digits in terms of what they can do. I’ll also say that the state DOTs are probably gaming it a little bit right now. Given the times, they’re being very conservative. They expect to see the stimulus money come rolling out and they’re just sitting on the sidelines waiting to see it come and then I think you’ll see more work at the state level than you expected, because they will feel that they are in a much better position overall to move forward, have a bit more buffer.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: And just additional color on that, do you think that when state DOTs in particular are talking about their budgets in ‘10, when they give a number they’re basically sandbagging?
Stephen Zelnak: I think they’re haven’t been burned in the last couple of years both by escalating costs and by recently declining revenue. I think they are being extremely conservative and I think part of what they’re trying to tee up in each one of their states is a premise which is true, they need more revenue. So politically it’s something that they’re promoting to try to get some more revenue.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Mike Betts with JP Morgan.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Yes hi, good afternoon. I had a number of questions, Steve. I mean maybe can I just go back to the pricing issue and could you just maybe remind us or maybe finalize what on average did you get mid year ‘08 in the end? Was it sort of a couple of percent across the board or was it a bit more than that?
Stephen Zelnak: It was in that range, Mike. We had talked about it before, but if you go back to the original forecast, we did not expect to get any significant mid year increases. With the sharp escalation in fuel prices and energy, we were able to go out and do that. So a couple of extra percent at that time and if you recall, we actually bumped our yearly forecast up to reflect that and then you’ve got the carry over effect.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Just remind me again. I mean typically it takes what six to eight weeks? If you put a price increase in July, it would be really sort of August/September before you got that or was that an out-of-date view of mine?
Stephen Zelnak: You will have wait time, because it’ll stretch out even further than that for projects. Where you’ve quoted somebody on a bid project, where they’ve made a commitment, you’re not going to change that price. So you’ve got some kind of price locked in; typically today it’s with escalators, but it would not reflect the mid year increase.  You will have other customers who have committed work and you’re going to give them protection on that work. You’re not there to destroy their cost structure. So by the time you really get that moving, you don’t see the full impact until you get into the fourth quarter if you do it July 1. I mean that’s full impact on work that you can get impact on. The contractual work, I guess you have to wait until that expires.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: I guess where I’m going with this, now I’ll move to another question, but a similar thing would apply with the Jan 1 ‘08 increase. It would take a while to get it all through. So carry through into ‘09 from the price increases in ‘08 must be at least a couple of percent, isn’t it?
Stephen Zelnak: Maybe a little bit, yes. With contractual work yes, you’ll always be moving forward based on the contractual work that rolls off and new contractual work coming on. When you look at the January ‘08 increases and the January ‘09 increases, in both cases, you have much less protected tonnage that is not contractual, because what we’ve done is go after customers early, tell them not to quote work based on those old prices, because they’ve got new prices coming and they should check with us before they make any significant commitments. So we’ve attempted to minimum that lag time.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Okay. Let me then if I could move onto the specialty products and I apologize to the people involved in this business, because we probably tend to only ask about it when it’s at more difficult times, but it was barely profitable in Q4.  Obviously there was a $3.3 million provision, but the run rate is way less than what you’re forecasting for the whole of ’09 and the lime for the steel industry. I mean are you kind of assuming that that business is going to struggle in the first half and then it’s going to strengthen in the second half? Is that the kind of the way we should look at that for ‘09?
Stephen Zelnak: I think the general trend line would be that. I think what you’re going to see is just what we saw in the fourth quarter. The steel industry is going to be highly volatile in terms of its production rates. As you know, they very quickly adjust today as opposed to building inventory and what you saw in the last part of the year was that steel production dropped 50%. We had shutdowns that we didn’t anticipate and certainly steelmakers didn’t anticipate. Volumes dropped sharply and they said “look, we’re not going to build inventory.”  So, to the extent that we can make reasonable estimates which is what we’re trying to do, we have tried to bake that into the forecast. If you look at the fourth quarter, we had a good quarter in the magnesia chemicals business. That business continues to grow; a lot of water treatment products; market share gains against caustic soda in a number of areas, good ceramic products business and lots of other chemical specialties. Our expectation is we’re going to have a very good year in that segment in 2009 and we’ve got a couple of things we’re looking for us as we come out of the chute.  Last year, we produced our new Elastomag product we acquired in the year at the existing facility owned by Morton. We’re moving that production to our facility. We’ve been getting it ready. So, we will cut close to $2 million to production cost that will go to the bottom line. So, that’s a good place to start and then we’ve also got another product where we picked up a take-or-pay contract and based on volume and price that contract is worth close to $3 million.  So those are two things that didn’t happen in ‘08 that happened in ‘09 as a place to start. So mag chemicals should have a very, very good year and we think the dolomitic lime business will be down relative to ‘08, we think volume and profit. 
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Okay and my final question if I could is on the redundancy costs. I mean you’ve not separated them out in previous quarters, so I guess they were much, much lower. I mean how many of the 4,900 redundancies during the year or the employment reduction, how many of that occurred in Q4?
Stephen Zelnak: Total headcount reduction in Q4 was probably around 200 or so people. The SG&A component of that if I recall was $58 million, but we had hourly layoffs as we went and may have been a little bit more than that. I’m just working strictly from memory and I tend to compare it more year-to-year, although I’m looking at the sheets by month.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: I guess I’m wondering why there was a significant severance cost in Q4, not in the other quarters.
Stephen Zelnak: Well, you had some senior long term people who came out of the organization. The severance costs associated with senior salaried people is really what drove that.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Okay, now I understand that. That’s great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question with Timna Tanners with UBS.
PT Luther – UBS: Hi, this is PT Luther in for Timna today. Just following up on a question just asked, can you tell us what the percentage steel represents as the end market for specialty chemicals?
Stephen Zelnak: Yes, about 30%. If you take our lime business, just to break the whole thing out for you, in terms of revenue, the mag chem business is roughly 60%; the lime business is about 40%, but 10% of that lime we consume internally. So it’s about a 70:30 split.
PT Luther – UBS: Okay great, thanks and then can you talk about what leverage you’re comfortable with as you are looking at these acquisitions I guess before equity? What kind of debt levels you’re comfortable with?
Stephen Zelnak: In this marketplace, we’re not going to do anything that puts us in a liquidity problem situation. We’re not going to skate close to violating covenants. We’re fully committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.  So we’re going to protect that first and foremost and then what you do when you look at these acquisitions from there, you’re going to back into what you need to do on the equity line. It’s going to be the significant majority if not all, and then you’re going to price the deal accordingly, based on the fact that you’re using equity as opposed to using the debt.
PT Luther - UBS: Right, okay thanks. Then lastly with your free cash flow forecast, are you anticipating much benefit from working capital release from that?
Anne Lloyd: I would expect not.
PT Luther - UBS: All right great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go next to Clyde Lewis with Citi.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Good afternoon, Steve, Anne, Howard. Three if I may; the comment you made on fuel cost being sort of $35 million to $50 million better this year, was that based on static volumes or was that based on volumes being down 9% to 12%? I just wanted to clear that up?
Stephen Zelnak: It’s based on the volumes that we’re looking at. There are two components to that Clyde, just so I can be clear on it. There is a diesel fuel cost component in there which is the reduction of the price we pay for diesel fuel and also there is a reduction related to fuel escalators we have that are attached to our long haul transportation contracts, both rail and water. So the $35 million to $50 million is a sum of that, plus natural gas savings that we’re looking at in our magnesia specialties business.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Okay. Could you maybe give an indication for what you think would be on a static basis, on flat volumes?
Stephen Zelnak: I’d be guessing. We’d have to go back and calculate it.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Okay. The second question I had was on acquisitions. I know you’ve had plenty of questions already on acquisitions, probing and prodding. I mean, would you expect to sort of (a) move into any new regions and new markets that the group’s not in already or would you actually sort of look at all about getting involved in other products that you’re not currently involved in a bigger way? Would the focus be on where you are now and where you’re just trying to grow your business share in these current markets?
Stephen Zelnak: Well, from a strategic standpoint, I’m an old military guy and I like to kind of move down the road and take adjacent territory as opposed to doing parachute drops in the enemy territory. So we were being more focused on things that are complementary to where we are geographically, that would have higher value to us, because we can leverage that from an SG&A standpoint, most effectively sharing of equipment. So that’s what we like the best.  Would we look at something that is remote from where we are right now in the United States? We would, but it’s going to have to be pretty compelling to us to want to do it and we would price it accordingly. Products lines, certainly we’re aggregate folks first and foremost, no question about that. It’s going to have to have a very significant aggregates component. Some of the things that people want to sell are vertically integrated. We will look at the vertically integrated packages, but we’re going to price it accordingly.  Clearly, the vertical integration has shown its volatility, and one of the nice things about the aggregates business is that it’s not as volatile with the infrastructure component and it is a bit easier to manage the volatility I think than in the aggregates business. So hopefully that’s helpful.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: That’s great, thank you Steve. The last one I had, just can you remind us, how many new quarries coming on stream line in 2009 and what sort of tonnage they would contribute?
Stephen Zelnak: I couldn’t give you that, there are very few. Even some of the ones that were announced, people have said “No, I don’t think so. Not right now.”
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Not for the market now, for just yourself?
Stephen Zelnak: For our self? We’ve got one quarry that is coming on near Fort Bragg that we got underway with late last year and we will open that up, but the Fort Bragg area in North Carolina at Fayetteville is a very high growth area. It’s a beneficiary of base realignment; probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 additional people moving in there over four years and we would have the only quarry in Fayetteville, certainly the only one close to Fort Bragg, so we’re pretty excited about that.  We’ve got another small quarry that we opened, base quarry in North Carolina in the latter part of ‘08 in Eastern North Carolina and we may possibly get another one opened up at a low level in ‘09, but that’s going to be it.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Okay, so $1 million to $2 million tons extra?
Stephen Zelnak: It won’t be that much. Ultimately it will be out of those locations, but certainly not in ‘09.
Clyde Lewis - Citi: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management : Hello, everyone. I just have a couple of minor questions. I guess for Anne, do you have DD&A for 2009?
Anne Lloyd: We expect it to be about $182 million.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management : And with the reduction in CapEx this year, will DD&A shrink like for ‘10 or what’s the relationship there?
Anne Lloyd: It will eventually, you’ll see a dip in it, but I think it won’t change dramatically for ‘10.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management : Okay great, and then your free cash flow at $150 million to $175 million, that’s before dividend, is that correct?
Anne Lloyd: Correct. 
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management : Okay. That’s all I have, thank you.
Anne Lloyd: All right. Thank you, John.
Operator: And Mr. Zelnak, at this time I’ll turn the call back to you sir for any additional or closing remarks.
Stephen Zelnak: Okay, thanks for joining us, certainly a lot of very good questions. It’s interesting times. Certainly everybody’s challenged and we think we’re managing the times quite well. I’ll just add that on a personal basis, I’m extremely proud of our management group for adapting to the toughest environment we’ve seen since the early ‘80s and before it’s through, maybe the toughest that anybody’s seen since 1940s.  So I think our group is doing an excellent job. They’re being very realistic and we’re doing what we need to do to turn in the best performance that we can possibly put up and be ready for a little of that incremental tonnage coming off the stimulus program. Thanks a lot. Call us if you need anything.
Operator: Thank you and that does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-28 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and CEO Anne H. Lloyd - Sr. VP, CFO and Treasurer
Analysts: Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc. Todd Vencil - Davenport Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs Garik Shmois - Longbow Research Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Operator: Good day and welcome to this Martin Marietta Materials Incorporated Third Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Zelnak. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for joining us today. I have with me Howard Nye, President Chief Operating Officer; and Anne Lloyd, our CFO. We are very pleased with our third quarter results given the conditions in which we operate. The third quarter was our 10th consecutive quarter of down volume in our aggregates business, as compared to the prior year period. Shipments volume for the quarter was down 13% which was a product of a short pullback in construction activity based on credit market issues and the deteriorating economy. In addition, we experienced four major storms in our areas of interest which compounded problem. Aggregates pricing continue to meet our target expectations with an increase of 8% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date. The Midwest continue to be the bright spot as Heritage volume in Iowa and Nebraska was up 15% over to prior year period and year-to-date. The strong foreign economy and alternative energy projects were the main drivers. We also experienced positive volume in our operations that cover Arkansas, East Texas and Northwest Louisiana. This is the result of increased oil and gas drilling activity. The most negative volume comparisons were in the Carolinas and the Atlanta area, with shipments down 20% to 34% for the various market areas. On the cost side we're running most plants on reduced schedules with many of our plants scheduling recurring shut downs of one to two weeks as needed to control inventory. During the third quarter, we did an exceptional job of managing our controllable cost. Even with the reduced production tons per man hour [ph] was equal to the prior year period. We do this as exceptional performance in a very volumes sensitive. Our specialty products business continue to perform well with a record third quarter sales of $46 million up 18% from the prior year period. Operating earnings decreased slightly as we experienced high energy costs, and high maintenance costs related to both planned and unplanned repairs. Both the Dolomitic Lime business and the Magnesia Chemicals businesses are performing well with record sales and earnings expected for both businesses for the year. For the quarter we earned $1.58 per diluted share versus $2.13 in the prior year period. In addition to the sharp decline in aggregates volume, energy costs was up $16 million for negative impact of $0.23 per diluted share. We also had a surge charge of $2.6 million and $3 million of expense related to strategic initiatives that reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. The impact of weather costs that's another $0.08. On a positive note, State of Florida recently launched its Accelerate Florida initiative aimed at advancing start dates on $1.4 billion in road construction to stimulates the state's weakening construction economy. Martin Marietta is well position to service much this work to through our granite quarry in Nova Scotia and fall line our granite quarries in South Carolina and Georgia. We will also have our new plant at Augusta Georgia online in the fourth quarter, the 6 million tons of cost effective capacity versus the old plant which produced 2 million tons. We believe it is increasingly likely that Congress will come back into session after the November elections, with the objective of passing an economic stimulus package. We would expect that any such package would contain meaningful funding for infrastructure. Our business continues to generate solid cash flow even in a weak economy. In the nine months ending September 30th, net cash provided by operating activities was $271 million or $2 million less than the prior year, in spite of a $55 million decline in net earnings. Aggressive control of working capital coupled with lower cash taxes from lower pre-tax earnings and the benefit of bonus depreciation deductions has been a positive for cash flow. Looking at the rest of 2008, lack of available credit which install construction activities likely to continue and will keep downward pressure on aggregates volume. We expect the volume decline for the year to range between 11% to 12%. However, we expect pricing growth to be in our target range of 6% to 8%. We also expect record earnings from our specialty product segment of $36 million to $38 million. Based on these factors we expect net earnings for 2008 to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.65 per diluted share. We're developing our preliminary views on 2009 as we complete our regional operating plans. We characterize the upcoming years of period of stabilization in our aggregates business, with the first half subject to continued volume pressure. If Congress passes a package with infrastructure stimulus funding, we can see positive impact in second quarter of 2009. Currently we expect moderate price increases, stabilizing aggregates demand and a deflationary cost environment as relates to energy cost. In our specialty product segment, we expect another year of record sales and earnings. Also we anticipate that capital spending will be no more than $185 million in 2008 based on early completion of our Augusta, Georgia plant and no large projects plan for 2009. At this time, I would be pleased to take any questions you may have. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I'll go first to Arnie Ursaner with CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Hi good afternoon.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Arnie.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: My question relates to, I know Steve you probably taken the most aggressive actions of any of the aggregate companies to reduce your cost and really done a job of it. Given the current environment is... can you give us a sense of the types of actions you might be able to take from here, and is there some more room you have to lower your cost structure?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly we're very focused on trying to bring the cost structure down even more. If you look at the SG&A area, where they typically viewed as the best operator and has the numbers to back that up with respect to SG&A as percentage of sales. But, clearly we're going to do more. We'll talk to you at the end of the year about what actions we'll take there. But we've got to bring the cost structure down more in that regard with respect to the environment that we're in. We're looking at all aspects of controllable cost and by that I mean the senior management sitting here in this room, going over this company line-item by line-item from we're looking at everything we do. And simply asking the question is it necessary in these times. And I think you're going to see us do things like reduce communication cost through renegotiation of contracts there. More judicious use of communication media that's one area we're focused on, or you going to see us focus very hard on purchasing. We think we have some potential opportunities in the purchasing side of our business and we're going to attack those from senior management level and down. So it's getting a lot of attention, these are the times that are very unusual, certainly the most difficult that I have seen since the early 1980s. And I think we have to respond accordingly.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: All right. Second question if I can, can you speak a little bit about the energy side of your equation and perhaps high level, a little bit more about the structure of the long haul transport contracts you have in shipping and how that could be effective by lower energy cost?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Couple of aspects of the energy cost, I made the comment that as we look at 2009, we do think that we're going to be in a deflationary energy environment. We actually were making those kinds of comments well before oil prices came down sharply as they had in the last couple of weeks. Pretty clear to us that there was going to be downward pressure based on demand. If you take conception for us, and look at it just on diesel. Diesel next year, given reduced volume, we probably consumed somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 38 million gallons of diesel. And it would not be surprising to me that we would see reductions over the year of $0.50 to a $1 as we look at what we paid in 2008 versus what we're likely to pay in 2009, so there is some real opportunity there. Natural gas and our magnesia business, looks like it's going to come down sharply. It would not be unusual to see a reduction there that might be as much of third of our natural gas costs. So clearly, that would positive for us. And then with respect to the transportation contracts, we have the energy escalators in those contracts. So the railroads hit us with energy escalators. We particularly get hit on waterborne shipping; we have the barging escalator or de-escalation being very significant with diesel fuel going down, we would expect that we're going to see positives with respect to our transportation cost less of for the railroads but more so for the waterborne transportation. So, that should be another plus.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Thank you for that answer. That's great. Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We will go next to Kathryn Thompson with Avondale Partners.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Hi, thanks. Could you give us a little bit more color that how we should think about your volume trends and pricing for aggregates and really specifically, what was your pricing at the end of quarter relative to your average for the quarter aggregate pricing? And then just the generally our regional pricing differences but with the regions they were able to get greater leverage with pricing during the quarter?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: With respect to the end of the quarter versus the average, really no significant difference. If you look at the individual much, you would find that they were clustered very tightly around that average. With respect to regions, we let that out for you. The reality is that we have gotten better pricing in the Southeast. The areas that have been more pressured from a volume perspective, they have gotten less pricing and it's really pretty much what the economist would predict. As we go into next year I think we're going to see modest pricing across the board inline with the comments that I've made. I don't think you're going to see the degree of regional deference that you've seen in the last couple years because frankly you don't have the same opportunity in the Southeast that we had in recent years. So it's going to move back closure to medium price level, medium price, rate price increase. So I think you'll see lot of less disparity next year.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: And so for that medium price increase going next year, would you still see it kind of generally in that mid to high single digit range or do you see pulling back one.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Too early to comment, we would just said moderate rate of the increase... moderate would be less than what we're looking at this year the range issue being 6% to 8%.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Well that would imply that you are going to still see some negative volume trends going into 2009. Is that a correct assumption?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We stead that. We certainly expect first half of the year to show negative volumes. The key to it is the credit market situation. What we're seeing out there that I've certainly never experienced and probably most on recall, is projects that are starting or actually underway in some cases where the lenders of pulling the funding and the developer/contractor are left hanging. That's just something that we've not seen. So the credit markets have got to fury up and get back to something that is more normal, not necessarily back to where they were because they are not going back there. But they need to be in a more function in a more business like manner. I mean we have seen purchase orders just disappear, where we got a PR in hand, we're getting ready to shift their project in some cases we would have run inventory for that project and all of the sudden the projects is not there. So that's the big thing that has to happen to get this construction economy back on a much more including.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Mid trend picked up I assume in the quarter. It's being quarter you are reporting?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am sorry I didn't hear the question, Catharine.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: I would assume that this trend is really came to ahead during the third quarter?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: You're purchasing orders just as appearing?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes absolutely. We... as we looked ahead, based on what we had in hand, what we thought we are looking at, we thought the third quarter was going to be an okay quarter in midst of a downward term line developed, but nothing like what we saw in terms of the volume decrease. And keep in mind, we also get our storm overlaid at certainly it was not helpful.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Just stepping back and looking at broader in terms of the whole cycle, I guess if you go back the early 80s you had about a 32% decline in volumes peak to try [ph], looks like right now you're tracking around 20% to 22% decline. Do you see the current cycle also tracking closer to that, at 30 plus percent decline in terms of just volumes?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I certainly hope not. You're correct by the end of the year we should be somewhere in that down 20% from peak area. It's difficult to know what's going to happen. Certainly, the fourth quarter first, first half is going to be very challenging on the volume side. The other side of that is energy cost is clearly going to be down. So with the cost actions we're taking outside of the energy, plus energy we should give some relief with respect to the cost lies underneath revenue structure. So, we'll just have to see how those two balance are. Can't be down 30% plus, I wouldn't say that it could because it's been there before. In the early 80s that actually was to back-to-back recessions that stretched out well over 40 years, but we don't have ten consecutive down quarter right now, so would not be surprising we're going to see three years of down quarters. So, I would roll without I'm certainly not looking for it but I wouldn't I can't say definitively when will happen.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Okay. And just final two questions. Could you speck to visibility as relates to volume and then finally just housekeeping, what are your debt in free cash flow targets for the current fiscal year?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. With respect to visibility I don't think there... I think there is very little. It comes back to the credit markets so that something we don't control. We're operating after what contract to customers have in hand and when you get to a situation where purchase order disappear on you and you think you getting ready to shift up. That just gives you virtually no visibility. So I think it's extremely difficult to call and I'll let Anne to answer the question with respect to other debt for the cash flow
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yes free cash flow counting for the year we expect to be in a range of a $110 million or $130 million depending on final earnings. Debt estimated for the end of the year be around a $1.325 billion.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Thank you very much
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And our next question comes from John [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi good afternoon everybody.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi John.
Unidentified Analyst: I have number of questions. One, Steve could you maybe comment on liquid asphalt has that come down with oil and diesel and do you see that having any type of mitigating effect on tabbing [ph] type jobs?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It has begun to come down, in fact from the peak which was roughly $800 average and at few places were it got up into the 850 range. Based on current numbers that we are seeing with our customers as a last week, the numbers look to be averaging around 625 and dropping just like fuel prices were dropping. Some liquid asphalt is low as 550.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So there is clearly strong downward pressure on that and the entity on the other side of that can purchase more asphalt pricing by still met liquid coming down because the price of asphalt to concrete should be adjusted down with it.
Unidentified Analyst: Right sure. Okay and could you may be comment a little bit more on I guess the strategic review that there was some expenses in the quarter were more about the nature that is and then on the reason for the change in the debt covenants. Thanks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. With respect to the strategic review, I would have gave you more than I wanted to. The fact was that, the column that was in it and it popped up and we felt like we needed to comment. Obviously, we're not going to comment in detail on any strategic initiatives. We had couple of things that we've looked at, worked on that, we saw good add value for our shareholders. We'll continue to do that what the key part of that statement is add value for our shareholders. We are not going to do anything that we feel just not do that and do it very quickly.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So we continue to be very busy and very active and looking at opportunities. But we have stayed away from some opportunities that some others took advantage of that perhaps like; we used to have this one.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And that conveyance is there any additional information on that?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: John, this is Anne. Essentially we felt like it was appropriate to give us more room and flexibility with that conveyance [Ph] as we move forward through the next 24 months.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Just a prudent thing to do in this environment.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And we got great cooperation in doing it which our understanding is that most companies out there who are trying to do those kinds of things are not getting great cooperation.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's what differentiates us.
Unidentified Analyst: Good to have that flexibility. And then on the CapEx [Ph] due December 1st can you just talk about the plans for that at this point?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Well, continue to evaluate alternatives there including, access to the public market and other types of funding it think there obviously we have full capacity of our revolver of $325 million available to finance that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And have you look at all or anticipate using any of these government programs on the commercial paper? Would that be anything that would be advantages to Martin Marietta?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: The government papers I understand them only for A1, P1 commercial paper.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: That we... our commercial paper would not qualify for that program.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Betts with JP Morgan.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: Yes. Hi, good afternoon
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: I had two or three questions if I could. Steve the source firm [Ph] was returning to and also previously where I think you said that the aggregate prices were similar of the end of the quarter to the average. Does that mean the immediate price increases largely failed or this is it the case that because of contracts etcetera they are still to show any benefit? That's my first question.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, actually the third quarter pricing improved because of the [indiscernible] end crisis. So we had a positive trend line there.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: But I mean normally you have contracts in place that delays the impact or was that not the case? I mean given the way markets are changed, is it more immediate now the impact, those immediate price increases?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. we always have contracts in place, that were quoted at different times, that have different prices. And those prices are typically going to be lower prices. So we've to roll through those... those would be commitments on public work, those in some cases would be commitments on large non-residential jobs and that's more than 50% of our business, so there is always some roll forward. We are quite pleased with what we saw our pricing in the third quarter, I think it validates once again that there is pricing opportunity in the business, after 10 consecutive down quarters of volume. And it gives us confidence in talking about a moderate rate of price increase in 2009 as we go into what's clearly on being another challenging year.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: Right. You let this quite not jump to 2009 there I mean I think as we end the 2008 there was sort of a similar expectation that the first half would be difficult and then they would see some recovery in the second half, obviously circumstances have change. I mean the recovery that we're hoping for is very much going to be federal program based, or do you so expect take it from you're the direct so do you expect that you might see housing picking up later in the year or is another factor behind why you think it might be better in the second half of '09?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I do expect to see some improvement with respect to the demand for storm from the housing sector, don't confuse that with any pickup in housing stocks. The issue that's out there in certain markets is that there is going to be a shortage of build a lots in some of those markets and some additional subdivisions are going have to be developed, subdivision work has being non-existent last couple of years. We think by second half of '09 we're going to see some of that begin to comeback just to support the start level that's out there. We will see what the Democratic Congress is going to do. But I think any program they come out with is going to be designed to try to put at bottom under housing and to begin to move it back up all be it may not be sharply. I think they understand it; it is creating a significant downdraft on the economy. Likewise they're most committed to job creation and in long-term investment United States which is why they have to focus on infrastructure. So we have to... after the elections or in next January depending upon how the debate and the votes go in Congress. I think very likely that you're going to see something that will be positive for our industry coming out of the new Congress or the one that finishes up.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: Okay. On the asphalt, obviously it doesn't impacted in terms of budget don't kind of fall up, were you caught at all with fixed price work at the much high rational prices or all of your contracts are flexible pricing where they were at flexible pricing?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We're not significant asphalt producers and we do very little construction. So it's negligible for us. It's not even a factor you have to think about, when you think about Martin Marietta. You have to talk to the other companies who have big asphalt presence, and the big contracting presence and you know who they are.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: Okay, thank you. And the last question Steve, the weather hit in Q3, I mean is that just in reality gone or would you hope there could be some catch up with that over the next couple of quarters?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think quite honestly in this environment Mike, it's an environment where there is no pressure on people to do work today that they might be able to defer because one of the things they see is they see a price of that work going down. If you are an asphalt contractor and more than likely your asphalt work is tied to some type of fixed price. You rather wait and do it next year, as oppose to do this year because your view would be that you're going to be paying less for liquid asphalt next year. Likewise you're going to be paying less for fuel, contractors are fuel intensive. There is steel in the job and they'll be paying less for steel. So I think there is a tremendous incentive to defer work and feel that... if you are contracting you make more profit or go at losses put it that way. If you are the ultimate buyer you're going to buy more for your money.
Mike Betts - J. P. Morgan: Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Good afternoon.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Trey.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Just real quickly. You talked about your thoughts on federal stimulus help coming next year possibly. But can you give us an update on what's going on, what the status of some of the other big infrastructure projects that are kind of looming out there in some of your primary states?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well we talked about toll roads in North Carolina and first letting the toll roads and the issue there comes back to credit markets. You've had the letting, now you have to do is finance it with bonds and when the credit market clears up that financing will get done and than the work can proceed. So that's 2009, even though the first round of work has already been left. You've got similar issues across the board that the states are challenged in two ways. They are challenged on the revenue that comes into their DOT because of declining gas taxes, and in some cases they have used taxes trends like that, sales tax on vehicles, vehicles sales have declined also, so where that's a factor in their revenue, that's declining. So, they have that factor they're trying to contain with and then where it is bond funded work; it becomes a matter of the placement of bonds. So, what I would tell you is we have some states that have stepped up to address revenue. But the biggest states for us have not done that yet. North Carolina is in the pros of looking at it. South Carolina is going to have to make a move, Georgia, very much, needs to make a move. They're programmed for next year, if they don't make a move, its going to be down sharply. Texas is short in their DOT fund; the turnpike part of it continues to be fairly strong. But I mean there is nothing out there that is robust right now, that's out of the norm. Its going to be dependent upon federal stimulus I think initially, and dependant upon the states following up with additional revenue measures.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But now it is going to cost you more to drive period.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Also can you give us your thoughts regarding buyback looking out into '09?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Buyback in this environment from standpoint of share price obviously, we love it. But from the standpoint of credit dynamics, our first priority is to pay down debt. And it's going to be to continue to pay down debt. This is an environment where you simply don't want to take risk. And as you know, and I think, probably everybody on the call knows, we cash flow very, very well. But the same time we're not going to speculate on that. We're going to pay down debt. We get to a point where we're very comfortable than we can consider again but I think that's well out.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And just one last question. You've have been seeing some really good work come by way of some of these energy related projects. With oil coming down and natural gas coming down, would you expect to see kind of a follow up of that type of work, as a result?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, logically with the decline in the price of oil and natural gas in the last month or so, I would expect that that hard year [ph] that we talked about in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana, we're probably going to see a reduction of activity, that would be logical. What don't I think is going to come down and in fact likely will continue to trend line up is wind energy. We continue to see a lot of wind energy activity. My guess is at the federal level with whatever comes out of there you are going to see more emphasis for wind energy and an attempt to make sure that funding back up is there to move those projects along. So I don't think that's going to be impacted in a negative way. I think probably a positive way from the federal.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: And could you remind us which states are your biggest states for the wind energy that you're seeing?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Texas is the number two wind energy state in the country. Obviously we're big in Taxes and that's become a very nice piece of business in South Texas, down in the North Carolina likewise other opportunities throughout West Texas. Iowa was the third largest wind energy state and we are the largest producer in Iowa, we're seeing a lot of activity there. And looks like there will be follow on projects to some of the ones that are already on they way. So, we're pretty optimistic about that aspect of energy.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Just there are some of you that I have given this metric, for those who I haven't. We've got enough wind energy business now. So we've got round metric of that 1500 tons per turbine, that's a combination of the concrete pad and the roadways that go in there to crack the turbines, a pretty big business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Davenport.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Hi, Good afternoon. As we talk about volumes coming down and if we talk about costs coming down and all the things, you guys are trying to do safe cost. How much pressure does that begin to put on pricing, I mean do you think you potentially find yourself in a situation where energy comes off and competitors don't necessarily have that the work [ph] neither heals in terms to higher diesel cost that you could see people start to cut price? Or at least maybe be less disciplined about price increases?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Todd don't make any mistake about it. There are people who cut price today, there are people cut price all of the time. But certainly over the course of last two years, on particular jobs and where people might be long on particular sizes, you will see price reductions to that. It's been measured but it's certainly there is more volume pressure; you see more of it and that's logical. If you think about where the right of pricing increases has gone, we peaked up at 13.5% in 2006 down to the 10% level in 2007 between 6% and 8% this year and below that moderate rates have increased next year. So in fact that happening and that's in our equation in terms of estimating what types of pricing might be available to us. The realty is that if you sit down with your pencil and piece of paper. It's pretty hard to volume your way out of this economic downturn because if you cut price and take business from a competitor, being the macho business that this is. The other party is going to turn around and do exactly the same thing. Based on my calculator that says that all the parties in the market have simply cut their price in traded volume and I don't think that lead just to particularly get outcomes. But that's for other people to figure out. We are running our business by size, by customer, by job and there are peritonitis on that basis to get some pricing increases but certainly not like what we had at two three years back. So it's already reflective of.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Okay. Switching views and just sort of expand on some of the things you said about, about government spending and especially settled government spending. We're going have to do something about either reauthorization or some other form of a federal plan after September next year. My understanding I guess is that what we're doing right now, we're funding federal however work to continued solution. And I guess everybody's probably waiting to see what happens in week. But can you tell us what you're hearing about the shape that people talking about the next federal programs might take and I mean from where I am sitting it looks like, how we trust fund, a sort of structure that we had unless you can convenience somebody to raise taxes some point you sort of tapped out in terms of growth.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If you go back to the commission that was set up to study the issue of transportation financing. They came out with a recommendation which was to raise the gas tax $0.50 a gallon. I think that one, was pronounced bid on arrival and I would agree it was dead on arrival. I think the bigger question is what is the form of financing going forward and increasingly what you are hearing as people focused on VMT or vehicle mass travel as the way that revenue structure out to be oriented. By mandate you are going to have increased fuel map of gasoline mileage for vehicle. So, that's going to cut fuel consumption. I clearly see changing habits on the party American Public. And I think even with lower gasoline prices that some of their changing habits you're going to stick, the younger generation that these times [ph] differently, and I think they are likely to go back to business in a more fuel efficient much less road intensive way. So, it get bags of VMT approach, whether or not that's actually what gets done I don't know, but certainly the politicians are focused on that. The collection of that would have to done in a very simple way. And, in fact, it might be at the state level, in North Carolina, what we're looking at is possibility is collecting the VMT at the annual safety inspection were the [indiscernible] the safety inspection anyway. And then applying the rate against that in collecting it once a year, that could be a vehicle for the federal government also. But they can't stick with gas tax. I don't think that's going to be parallel to big increases and clearly the tourmaline on revenues are going down.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The only thing I would mention is that I can't recall that authorization of the new bill determine [ph] done all time. So you should expect that continuing resolution as they tried to figure it out. Hopefully it is a continuing resolution that follows behinds some specific stimulus action that has already been put there.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Got it. And then housekeeping, you mentioned $185 million of CapEx, was that '08 or '09?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's '09.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: 2008, we expect to be in the $255 million range.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And we had come down shortly, we'll have a very good free cash flow generation next year and back to applying that to that.
Todd Vencil - Davenport: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Jack.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Steve, I wanted to ask about this, you mentioned credit disruptions and cancellations et cetera. Is that base... are you just seeing that across more or less all of your markets, or is it fairly... is it centered in one... in more prices than others.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly we're seeing it in the Southeast, some on the Southwest. In our market areas, we're seeing more in South East than anywhere else. If you think about lending, you might draw the with Wachovia who was an aggressive lender into the construction markets both, res and non-restructuring. And you can kind of take it from there.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And you mentioned, housing, in an earlier comment, but I wanted to ask, or getting back to the Q2 call where you made... I guess what where we're seeing positive comments about housing, just looking at... looking forward around into mid '09 or so with not allowed subdivision activity having gone on for a quite sometime and maybe the need to pick that backup. Is the recent credit market disruptions is kind of put-off any hope that we might see even some stabilization in housing in ... by mid or later 09?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think so, Jack. If the recent credit market disruptions continue the way that has been evidenced in the third quarter, you can jut kind of lockup shop and put-off everything, because, frankly nothing has happened in much of anywhere. Certainly, there is an expectation that with Federal government actions or rejection of liquidity into major banks and regional banks and insurance companies, that there is going to be some move to normalcy, grinded [ph] the party on the other hand, this is going to have to be able to pay it back. It's a noble concept. I think you will ... once we get some stabilization and then the money begins to flow, which suppose that started this week, the banks should get back into the lending business, or be it very careful. And if that is the case, they'll start making choices you they land to and who they don't. That in turned is going to be consolidation of players in various industries, probably including the housing industry. So, probably would be few out there but the ones that are there are more credit worthy, and likely to get credit extended to continue to go about their business, would be my view.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: The Portland Cement Association recently updated their forecast for '09 they see a 30% decline in non-residential construction in '09. I realize you guys are in cement business, but they are just talking about overall construction activity of... or do you have an opinion on that 30% decline in non-res in '09? Does that seem too harsh to you guys sitting here today?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It does seems to be a number to me that would be formulated off of what is going on right now. And again, if what is going right now has been going on in the last six weeks or so continues, who knows what the number is. But I find it difficult to believe that we're going to go forward as we get into next year without some reasonable credit market functioning. If that's the case, one thing that we're already hearing, is that there are developers out there who are looking at declines in the price of construction, who are saying, and you know I've had this project sitting, now is actually a pretty good time to move on it because my cost of construction is going to be lower based on materials cost, based on the fuel component that goes into construction, and based on the fact that I have got a lot of contractor choices from contractors who have very little work and are hungry and are bidding with very low margins. So we are actually... its interesting that you ask a question, because in the last two weeks for the first time, we're beginning to hear those kinds of rumbles. So, a sort of contrarian view out of the developer community.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Great. Okay, thank you very much Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Ajay Kejriwal with Goldman Sachs.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Thank you and good afternoon. Just a question on...
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Can you speak up Ajay, we can't hear you.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Can you hear me now?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You still need to speak up, very difficult to hear you.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Can you hear me now?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you and good afternoon. Just maybe a question on 4Q guidance to start with, the $0.40 range, one month into the quarter, does that reflect the uncertainty on volume or any trends in October that you think play out over the next couple of months? I mean I am just trying to figure why that wide range?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's all about volume. Volume is going to govern that number. We certainly have our cost structure under control. Again, we're managing that, I think extremely well. So it's going to be what we can put up on the revenue line that will determine the profit number.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And maybe if you can give some color on what you saw in October versus September, it sounds like things worsened off in terms of construction projects getting pushed up. But just in terms of any numbers around shipments or contracts if you can help us?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, not appropriate for me to comment on that with respect to fourth quarter, we'll talk about at the end of the quarter. The one comment I did make was with respect energy cost and the significant decline that we've seen at, I thought that was fair game but really not appropriate for me to frame the quarter beyond that.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Fair enough. Now about the lower CapEx for next year, maybe if you could give us the sense of how much of that $185 million is base maintenance CapEx versus any new projects that you're working and how much flexibility you have in with taking that CapEx down if think so if the situation deteriorates further with respect to the economy next year?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We normally frame maintenance CapEx is something around DD&A, that DD&A number for us this year is going to be around $168 million. What I would say to you with respect to next year is that given volumes that are off 20% from peak by the end of the year. We're going to have a lot less pressure on maintenance capitals than we typically have, so with the 185 you are going to have a maintenance capital number that is well below the 168. What we do have in there as we've got some strategic initiatives particularly as they relate to Florida. You will see us carry those out and we also have some strategic land purchases in there as they relate to long-term metal reserves. So even though we're in a difficult marketplace keep in mind this is a 50 year plus game, if you're not making the 50 year moves all the time you're going to get self in trouble and we don't plan to take that out with respect to the long-term aspects and that's the way we built our business. If in fact we were to see something that worsens beyond our expectations in 2009; we are fully prepared to tighten down on capital spending as tightly as we have to. And I'll tell how we are going play it. When we came in to 2008 based on the open authorizations for capital we had already proved. We had a carryover number of that $100 million of spending based on those open authorizations. We've spent the year 2008 buffering back, dampening down on authorizations some of which already existed and certainly limiting new authorizations. So as we go into 2009, our carryover number is $20 million or 20% of last year's. What that says as we come out of the chute, we have very little capital spending that we must do in Q1. We'll look at it by the quarter and we're going to measure it accordingly. So, we'll manage it very, very tightly. So I think we're in a position to do just that.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Great. Just continuing on that part a little bit, how much flexibility do you have in cutting costs at the quarry level? I mean could you postpone removing of the over burden or are there any other major cost buckets that you could take out at short notice versus dealing something the quarter and that comes back the next quarter?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly, you take a look at your over burden needs. And you try to measure that in terms of efficient pit development. We had prices where we need to strip in order to be an efficient operator. And we have some significant stripping projects underway at those prices. But where we do not need to strip in order to have an effective pit cost efficient pit, then you don't do it in these times. You put it all into another day, when your volume goes back up and in fact you've got to remove it faster because you need to get to more rock. So we've gained that based on the marketplace, the biggest single cost we have at the quarries is in the labor component. And in fact our manpower has comedown sharply, over the course of this year we're down through the first three quarters, over 300 people. Again some base of about 55,000 beginning of the year. I would suggest to you that by the end of the year that's going to go down probably, but not be surprising it goes down 150-200 more just based on not running all the plants based on other initiatives that we have to make sure that we're limiting and controlling cost. We've cut overtime hours to the bond, we're managing overtime hours had a very senior level in this company. It gets senior level attention, not just operating level attention. So I think we're doing that and we have the reporting mechanisms that allow us to manage that real time. So those are the things that we're working very hard on. One of the things you don't want do is do short-term things that impact your ability to operate effectively and sometimes operators will defer maintenance. We will measure what maintenance we do, but I can tell we're not going to defer needed maintenance for two reasons. One, you're going to make yourself ineffective cost operator, but secondly when you defer maintenance you can create safety issues, we have no intentions to compromise on safety. That's the way we're approaching it.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Great thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Hi, good afternoon. My first question is you talked about some markets that had experienced some pretty sharp volume declines in the quarter. Did you see any pricing weakness in any of your markets, negative price?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Prices in those markets continue to move up. Certainly, we would not have a 6% to 8% pricing metric overall for the company if they did not. Do you see more price competition on some individual jobs because of declining volumes, its just what the economist would tell you. Absolutely you did. So you're set to pick and choose more carefully. You can't get away from the fact that with reduced volumes you're going to see some degree of greater price competition. The amazing thing about our business is that we're still seeing above average rates of price increase, above our long-term trim line coming into this last cycle, here in the third year of volume decline, and I guess it speaks pretty well for the business.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Are you seeing this with diesel prices coming down? Are you seeing new entrants coming into the your markets and potentially pressuring pricing? Or has the market structure still remains relatively stable?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's tough for people to do that. We see occasional pot shots by particularly a couple of distant entrepreneurs trying to pick off a little piece of business down the road, 50 miles or so on occasion. But when you begin the look at how the quarries are laid out and remember the customer backs delivered cost. In most cases, we have such a significant transportation advantage over those folks, that it's just very difficult for them to cut a price enough to be an effective competitor. Yes we are cognizant of it, and there are a couple of situations where we've seen it take place.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. And just lastly, just a little bit more clarity on your CapEx for next year, I think you're supposed to start several new projects along the fall line Fayetteville, Selma and Columbia, are those some of those... are those projects still on track to get started?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: is moving along, that is a new green site location for us. And in fact we expect to be crushing rock and selling rock in 2009 out of the Fayetteville location, which by the way probably has significant hall of advantage of our nearest competitor. So we think we're going to do very well there, a lot of work at Wagon and the Fayetteville area. The summer project is not one that we are likely to crack up on in '09 we may do a little bit of ground scratching to get ready, it depends more on market conditions that is a green site. We've got some bigger projects that are in that five year plan in South Carolina and Georgia. And we may scratch the ground or break ground on one of those projects toward the end of '09 in Georgia. But that was the only one that we were planning on potentially starting in '09 materially a 2010 project.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good afternoon.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Most of my question have been answered very solid, but I want to tie back on a couple of pieces. One is if I can kind of piece together some of the things you said today it sounds like heading into 2009 towards the middle and of next year housing could get a little bit better but probably not appreciably so. On the public work side it sounds like... rather that's I really want to kind of circle around that we've seen significant slowness through the quarters, so starting in say July through August and into September on the public work side or is that kind of stay relatively steady, this is my question.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: With the kind of volume decline as we're having everything is down. If you think about from the state standpoint, they have been very nervous about the state as federal moneys coming out of the Harvard Trust Fund, because they knew there was an issue there and the federal government actually cutoff funds to the state at one point during the third quarter, because they literally have run out of money. And that's when you got the short-term fixed that took place where there was $8 billion worth of revenue transferred to the trust fund from the general fund to fix that problem through the expiration of the bill in September of 2009. So the states are playing it somewhat cautiously because they don't know at this point how good partner the federal government is. If the Congress comes in and makes it clear that from a funding standpoint that the federal government is a reliable partner, then I think you'll the states began to move more aggressively because they'll know the money is going to be there. They have been a bit in a rumble. So it really comes down to what is the Congress going to do with respect to infrastructure stimulus as far as public works goes, that will be the big piece. And then the other piece is the bond markets getting to rational functioning. So that bonds that are already authorized for both road projects as well as particularly school projects, can be issued and those projects proceed. Now, we talked about it before but I would just remind you that with construction cost declining, the federal government, the state government are all looking at that aspect to which certainly had some of them consult us, wanting our opinion on, whether or not declining construction cost were likely to be the trend in '09. And our answer to that is we think so based on materials cost coming down, other than aggregate which we told you is going to go up. And pressure on contractors because there is limited work.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. That puts it, I bet I can, guess for you where some of this federal money is been going to. I hear that they have been bailing out a few banks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's where we're.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. So, the last question I had was when you look at the specialty product business, I know there is a chunk of that goes to for steel. And when we look at steel production at least some schedules for what steel production might be in the fourth quarter. It looks like many of these folks now are going to be running at 50%-60% utilization, yet this maybe... from that kind of hold that you're projecting for the full year your strongest quarter in the year for steel. Can you give us a little, a little color there do you have the maize [ph] contracts in hand or have you seen any deferrals or things in that side of the business as well.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No we are... I mean we're not immune to steel business pulling back for any shut downs. We certainly know what the steel mills are planning in Q4. We confer with them in order to understand what the demands on; I don't know the climb will be. In fact we saw some of that in Q3. What we do expect in that business is that we believe that overall we're going to have record shipments of dolomitic lime for the year. We think we're going to have a good solid dolomitic lime in demand in 2009, probably not as high as it was in 2008 from a tonnage stand point. But we think we'll see some improved margins based on reduced energy cost that should be a nice positive for us. And then there is the other side of the business which is the MagChem business, the Chemical side that business is growing substantially. And in fact from a profitability standpoint we have some significant additional profit coming in '09, one piece of it is going to come from contractual obligations to forest heat resistant materials and the second piece would be the acquisition that we announced early in the year ElastoMag. We have been total manufacturing the product this year as we get ready to move the production facility to our location, into 2009 we will produce that product in our location and we will have margins that go with that production. So, there are some moving parts here underneath the surface that causes us to be pretty confident in terms of our performance in specialty products in 2009.
Chris Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Owen Gibbs with Austin Fires [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi there. I was just wondering is there a level of volume decline that you have in mind where you can see your pricing at zero, potentially negative?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I really don't. Our view is that as we go into '09 given the state of the economy that we're going to see some Federal stand of us, do we get to that... I mentioned before back to the 1980s, 30% or so volume declines from the peak. If we get some where in that range certainly there is going to be a lot of pressure, even more so than it is today. But I bring you back to the fact that it's not very productive to just sit there and cut price because you may take some volume away from another company but they're going to turn around and take it right back from you in the same marketplace. The bigger concern was already mentioned and that's people were trying to come in from way outside the market because of declining transportation cost coupled, associated with gasoline diesel prices and that's just very limited. So I think, it would be a scenario that at this point I just can't envision that is going to take you to flat or negative pricing for this business.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And one other point just on your renegotiated covenant, what was the liquid procured for the increase in that?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: We increased the facilities fees and at the current credit rate that would be LIBOR plus 225.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Katherine Thompson of Avondale Partners.
Kathryn Thompson - Avondale Partners: Hi. Just one follow up question I wanted to ask was, what gives you confident that you will see as a stimulus package passes, excuse me, late in the current calendar year or early next year. What gives you confidence that you'll see benefits by Q2? And what type of numbers have you seen floating out there in terms of the magnitude of that infrastructure spend?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The confidence that I would have with respect to Q2 is that the conversation about infrastructure funding and the stimulus package is very much oriented to our jobs on the ground as quickly as possible. And what has been asked of the states is what magnitude of work do you have that could be started within 90 days? And the answer that is comeback from the states is a number that's 8 plus... $18 billion. So, they have committed that if that money is there they that can get that magnitude of work started that quickly. So, whether we have a stimulus package late this year or early next year, it's likely going to hit it in the second quarter. But this year it's just whether that are precluded. If its next year, by the time the season opens which on average across the country is about 1 May, they deal within in January or February, nine days out, you are in the mud. So that's the way I would look at that aspect of it.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Katherine, [Indiscernible] this part was something on those statistics, if you want to go out and find those.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: he size...I talked about $18 billion. There have been numbers as they had have arranged higher, it's hard to know exactly how Congress is going to approach this. You see some economist throughout; they are talking about $300 billion total packages as needed to really pull the economy out of the current doldrums. You've seen a $150 billion as a target number floated by some of the key congressional democrats with the infrastructure piece of that being somewhere between that 18 billion on it [ph] into 25 billion plus. It's a floating number. But, pretty clearly substantial money stored infrastructure if they address this. So, I think that's encouraging.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn conference back over to Mr. Zelnak for any additional or closing comments.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We thank you for your participation, a lot of very good questions. I wish we had a totally clear crystal ball, we tell you what was in it, but we're trying to do best, were the circumstances we're in, and hopefully the commentary we gave you was helpful. Look forward to talking to you at the end of next quarter. Thanks
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time. .

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-08 14:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Martin Marietta Materials Incorporated Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Zelnak. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for joining us today; I have with me Howard Nye, Chief Operating Officer; and Anne Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer. The second quarter was down laid by energy short which effected those cost and demand in our aggregates business. The unexpected rapid escalation and the price of diesel fuel, natural gas, liquid asphalt increased these costs by $18 million over the prior year period, which in turn reduced earnings by $0.26 a share. Escalating construction cost particularly for liquid asphalt which was up 135% in the past year and about 75% this year through the second quarter cut demand significantly. Infrastructure spending was impacted by cost escalation to reduce its purchasing power resulting in lower volume consumption. State departments of transportation were also affected by lower gas tax revenues and gasoline consumption declined due to higher prices, the focus on higher mileage vehicles and reduced behavior by the American public. Volumes declined 9% during the quarter with the largest declines being in Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and North Georgia all of which were down more than 20%. The areas we expected to experience in those positive demands did so. Even though Iowa was notably impacted by rain and flooding, volume was up 9%, we also experienced positive volume in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. In response to the weaker and expected demand we reduced aggregates production by 12%. Which impacted earnings by $24 million or $0.35 per share. Beyond the impact of the energy and the impact of reduced production volume our operating management did an excellent job of controlling cost, demanding environment. Also our SG&A cost was down $2.3 million or 5% with SG&A as percent of revenue declining from 8.4% in the prior year quarter to 8%. We continue to aggressively work on ways to manage our business in more cost effective manner. More positive note we have record sales and earnings from our specialty products units with revenue up 14% to $45 million for the quarter and earnings from operations up 20% to $9.7 million. Our sales of... declined to the steel industry are at the record volume level which is expected to continue through the year. In our magnesia chemicals business we continue to see growth in demand for our treatment products and flame retards along with specialized products used in the paper industry and for manufacture of LCD television screens. Also our recent acquisition of the ElastoMag product line from Rolman Host [ph] has also did a very positive start. During the quarter we completed an asset exchange with Vulcan Materials which added five quarry locations in the Atlanta area and one in Chad and in the Tennessee. The integration of these assets into our system was accomplished quickly and has been seamless. During the quarter the North Carolina Legislature acted on the recommendations made by the 21st Century transportation committee. The most significant action was to provide sufficient GAAP funding to go forward with four previously approved tow road projects, valued at about $3.2 billion. As a point of reference peak annual road spending in North Carolina has been about $3 billion. The first of these projects bargained at almost $1 billion is in the lorry area, and is expected to begin late this year with completion in 2011. Estimated stone consumption is approximately 2 million tons. The two projects approved for the Raleigh area will start will start scheduled at 2009 and 2010. Fourth project is a bridge in northeast of North Carolina schedule to begin in 2009. The total estimated 6.5 million tons of stones for these projects, Martin Marietta will be able to complete effectively about 85%. North Carolina's 21st Century Transportation committee expects to present significant new revenue recommendations to the legislature by year end together with some likely additional toll road projects. This would obviously be a major positive step for North Carolina and our business in the state. Looking ahead pricing has been remarkably resilient in the face nine consecutive quarters of down volume. We were successful in implementing some level of medium price increase in most of our markets. We believe there are 6% to 8% price increase in the year as achievable despite market conditions. The key issues for the remainder of the year are aggregates volume and Energy cost with 2 billion cost relent. Given the significant impact of energy on second quarter aggregates volume we're lowering our volume forecast to minus 3% to minus 6% for the year. In our Specialty Products business we affirm our prior expectation of operating earnings of $36 million to $38 million and in this context our range for net earnings per diluted share is $5 to $5.65 for 2008. At this time I'd be pleased to take any questions that you may have. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Arnie Ursaner, at CJS Securities
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: good afternoon, Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Arnie.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: First question I have relates to the, can you attempt to quantify the impact of flooding that had on you in Iowa?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes I'll give you a wealth estimate and it gets really, Iowa combined with river system, because that water has to go somewhere, and where it went was in the river system in the middle of the country. If you take the two together obviously this is a wealth estimate, the impact is probably in the $7 million to $8 million range which is hard for share basis would be $0.10 to $0.12, we will have overlap into Q3 with carryover damage and disruption, we have a quarry in Cedar Rapids, Iowa which got a lot of publicity. Our quarry is under water, its a small quarry but, it filled up with 1.5 billion gallons of water and we we'll be popping that out probably through September may be in October. So disruption there we have disruption at same platform we are always and we have many other disruption on the river and some of that continues so that's where it is.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: According the operations of your business it sounds like feels like you are dramatically almost hit the break somewhere in the middle of the quarter your production volume guess was down 12% which is much greater than the volume reductions you are seeing for the industry is it fair to say in fact 10 very aggressively taken actions to reduce productions and are you also taking actions like perhaps pulling down the number of hours you work at some or the other facilities what other steps are you taking better balance your inventories are going in for the slower fund decision.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's a good question and certainly highly relevant and very much on alliance as a starting point we're not really interested in tying up working capital sitting on the ground. Just admired and as it became clear that volumes were not going to be what we had expected we did put breaks on and if you look at that difference its 12% reduction in production volume as you noted and that compared to 9% pull back in sales. If you take year-to-date and actually we have been working this year-to-date just more aggressively in Q2. We've got 11 million tons less productions as compared to that 7.4 million tons lower sales. So we just decided we are not going to get ourselves out of balance we're not going to see that how we can make the stock balance and what it does is it, it does conserve working capital but it also puts you in a better mode to run when you get some pick up. So -- but you're not working off inventory over hand. So we took a previous hit and that was intense. We just thought it was the right and prudent thing to do. With respect to cut backs, cut with metrics it might be interesting. First of all with respect to number of employees that are employed in our aggregates business, and obviously specialty products is going great. We've added a few folks there. But in our total aggregates business if you compare in the second quarter this year into the second quarter of last year. So you've got the seasonal impact in it. The number of people is down about 6%. If you adjust for the acquisition that we made from Vulcan and in the asset exchange where we also put quarry in their hands. We picked up about 75 additional people where it gives you some on same that numbers closer to 7.5%. If you look at reduction of ours worked year-to-date that numbers is about 9% in the second quarter, 10%. And in the second quarter we reduced overtime hours that 23%. And just to give you flavor for what this is all about. First of all our climate didn't since on note of rocket story that hasn't been around longest. This is clearly to toughest time since the early 1980s. And we are having to react accordingly. The big things you focus on in, you go after... I mean we are at a point now where we are scrubbing very hard at what time the shipments take place in each quarry can we adjust the working time by 15 or 30 minutes or even an hour. You get some more labor cost out without disruption of sales. If you go around our quarries all of our guys know what CFL light bulbs are now. And we are replacing conventional light bulbs into CFLs and how to use applications. It's not huge money, but the point is we're just nibbling everywhere there is an opportunity. Because in doing that, you get yourself setup. The first time you take some of the volume it's going to be incredibly attractive. So that's where we are.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: One very quick final question if I may, in your guidance for the up coming year, two questions. One is, in the quarter you had $0.13 from the discontinued operations, is that included in your guidance? And also what fuel costs is embedded in your guidance?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The guidance does include the $0.13. And fuel cost assumptions... actually the assumptions are basically flat slightly up. And as you know we are getting a down trend. And the way we get to the upper end of the range is to have that downward trend continue. That would be important.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Thank you very much.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Jack Kasprzak BB&T Capital Markets.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: Hello, actually this is Paul Betz for Jack. My two questions on guidance was answered. But the interest expense kind of went up this quarter. I know you've done some activity there. Do you have a run rate that obviously for the year or a quarter that we could we use in our modeling assumptions?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yes Paul this is Anne Lloyd. We... interest expense is expected to be about $74 million this year. Obviously it's up in the second quarter because of the advance funding we did $300 million of net we issued in April. That run rate include also the amortization fees provided for that to the offering.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. So $72 million gain that is in your... from the asset exchange that's in your continuing operations. You said it was split between the west and the Mid-East. Do you know the number for... how much went into each region?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: First of all 7.2 is not 72. We would love to just say. But we would get it.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: I'll get that number for you Paul.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Okay. Lastly the... you said the Augusta Georgia quarry is opening sooner than you expected in this year. Does that do anything with your CapEx outlook for 2008?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: For 2008, it's going to make it a little bit heavier than we would have expected. When we get to 2009, we get the benefits of that.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And earlier expectation for 2009 is that CapEx is going to be down significantly. We have other large projects, but it starts with later end of the year. So I think we're going to see a major CapEx reduction in 2009.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: And 2008.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We'll see a reduction in 2008, estimate for 2008 is $240 million, could be as much $250 million. And when we get to 2009, we will quantify later. But you should expect to see a significant reduction.
Paul Betz - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: okay.
Operator: We'll move next to Timna Tanners of UBS.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Yes, hi. Really just two questions as well. One was just to make so understand and to think about your pricing on two similar end of your 6% to 8 % pricing we are going have to see probably continued pricing from what you saw in the second quarter and actual little bit of an up-tick. So are you continuing to pass on price increases and are you seeing anything like what CXI talked about in terms of the energy surcharging plan to follow that initiative?
C. Howard Nye - President and Chief Operating Officer: With regards to console of DXI on their prices in here up lastly an implementation we'll do our own thing. We have a much more successful round of visual increases than we had earlier anticipated. And not that they are big but they would much more wide spread. And in fact in virtually all of the year is in coupling, we get certain type of mid-year increase not necessarily on our all sizes, not necessarily at every quarry. But we did get far more than we expected. So that's where the optimism comes to 6% to 8%. And we feel quite comfortable with that based on what we are looking at, that has already been implemented. So it's pretty in place.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay, great. And the other question was about buybacks, you did a small amount during the quarter. And just want to get your philosophy on stock buyback.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: We haven't done any of the buybacks during the quarter--
Timna Tanners - UBS: Sorry I miss read you there. Okay.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: The other thing we've done this year is we had $24 million of cash that was paid out the first in the year to settle four quarter with seven buyback. So we haven't acquired any additional shares.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay. So then the question is how you think to do that then?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The way we think about it is first of all we did the very large deal, for with Vulcan. And we took on additional debt to take care of that plus we did pre-funding of a debt maturity that comes up at the end of the year. But we're actually quite pleased we did that pre-funding. We think that's advantageous. The objective between now and the end of the year is to pay down debt. We have a defined target range and it was done far full yet, of being between two times and two and a half times debt-to-EBITDA. Expectation by the end of the year is it would be somewhere in the middle of that and get debt down on the $100 million or so on quarry. So the focus would be on debt repayment first and foremost right now. We always try to keep ourselves in balance, not that we don't like share price, we do, we love it. Chance of being of course it would be foolish in our view, not to take care of our balance sheet and also we need to take our debts, keep our balance on that
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay. So the focus of uses of cash in the near term is the pay down on $100 million to $125 million by year in that.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And next we go to David Macgregor of Longbow Research.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Hi Steve, Ann, Howard.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi David.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Hey Dave.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: I guess couple questions, first of all on the infrastructure one of your competitors were talking on the recent call about highway trust short fall and the fact there is a build for congress right now they are trying to address that, I guess the question is if bill passes in the next month or two, when we actually see the benefiting your P&L, in terms of these infrastructure projects?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It will be 2009 before you will get anything notable that will happen there, based on what has been proposed it's not huge money. But it could be very interesting. The typical flow on that money is it roughly 27% of it flows in the first year., mid 40s in the second year and then it stretches out on that. The state DoT would be the ones to decide which projects they are going to apply to I don't think there is any shortage of projects that have already been engineered and ready to go. So I think they can get out of the gate reasonably quickly but even if they do cranking up projects of any size takes a lot of mobilizing and again to actually put stone on the ground, put asphalt down. So its 2009 I believe we are pretty strongly that give the ramp up in unemployment which I take is going to continue for a while, the fact that we got the national election coming up in November. That it's likely that the Democrats are going to make infrastructure a priority, they seem to be doing it, and historically they have been very good for our industry. So it would not surprise me if they come forward, feel the walls kicking around right now is fairly modest program, under the characterise is stimulus with infrastructure being a component of stimulus. Would not surprise me that they come back with something that is broader, they talked about bond guarantee program. I think it's a function of unemployment amount same people are feeling and as unemployment rate picks up towards 6%, pressure is going to grow up. And given that that I think politics are leaning very heavily democratic, elections wise that their really going to carry the ball on this. So actually I'm fairly optimistic about that part of it.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Yes, two follow up questions, number one you said '09, before you'd see impact on the P&L, are we talking in first half '09, second half '09, and then on the stimulus package, what kind of numbers are being discussed with respect to the magnitude of that?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, with respect to I can't see it how we work that really get going typically until second quarter unless you are part of very warm climate. So, any impact you would see about that with the beginning second quarter. That's the earliest I think you would see it.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The infrastructure component, Senator Berg is the one it is carrying the water on this one right now. The infrastructure component of his stimulus package is roughly $7 billion and it is a variety of infrastructure components. But most of it would be aimed at roads and that's about a third of his total stimulus package. Anything that we're talking about with respect to bond guarantees or the programs would be beyond that, if you contrast his program... it's a long time certainly you're with that or Barbara Boxer [ph] in the house. Her program is a $50 billion program. And she's... she's pretty adamant about what she thinks needs to be done. So it will be interesting... take two averaging together, but he will tell you that the Democrats believe that there is additional stimulus needed. And they actually think that stimulating the U.S. economy as opposed to the Chinese economy would be a good thing.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Yes, agreed. Last question just with respect to gauging your confidence on pricing beyond 2008. What is the chance that you will see year-over-year pricing falling back to the low single digit levels that we saw in '82 through 2004?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is always possible but we just don't see it right now. My pricing will always be less next year than they are this year. I think they could be but if there all are they would be at likely at or above the peaks that we saw for the last 20 years. And we're just in a completely different in all cannot be viewed that I'll give you something to think about that I think its pretty interesting in measuring where we are and how this industries reacting. If you look at volume decline and you will annualized volume which the way you need to do it if you go back to the first quarter of 2006 which was the peak of the cycle. As a company we would talk in long in about 206 million ton annualized rate if you come forward to the second quarter just completed we are going to annualize the rate which was about 175 million tons and as a 15% decline in tonnage over that nine quarter period on an annualized basis. And if you go back to 1991 which was the last deep recession in our industry, volumes were down 10% and we gave a third of our profit and this is public company based but we've stated this before. So volume down 10% we gave up third of our profit, volume is down 50% if you take the range that we just put out and take the middle of the range and compare that with what we earned in 2006 which was 529 your profits split was slightly up on a 15% volume decline. I think it's pretty incredible we are in frankly you all will like that comparison with some of the other companies in the industry. But we have separated ourselves in that regard but it is an interesting way to look at it in my period what it says that we're positioned incredibly well from a cost structure standpoint and when we get a volume which will go with some better than historic pricing, your incremental are phenomenal.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Thanks, Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Ajay Kejriwal at Goldman Sachs.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Hi, just wanted to clarify on the EPS question as previously. So your guidance includes the entire $16.4 million or just the $0.13 of that $0.16?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It includes everything it's a total roll the numbers that we were reported at the end of the year.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and maybe some color on what's that 7.2 why would that be part of the operating income as that sustainable or how should we think about.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: There no properties that were operating properties and had not been classified as discontinued therefore it's just like its selling any other land or equipment that we have during the course of the year.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Which we do regularly and generate fairly significant income of it.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay all right moving to your volume guidance and if you back out what you did in the first half implies second half volume of what minus one to minus two lets see if my math is correct but does that sound right?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We think second half is going to be much better. The Midwest should be very strong volume some other disruption like flood. We think the Midwest is going to be extremely strong we are looking for a very robust agricultural land season out there. We have some very good project work in most parts of the company. We think we'll see positive volume in Indiana and Ohio in the second half. Now I got to ask a question about working out the whether impact, I just concentrated on Iowa but the reality is that Indiana, Ohio, are getting the impacted pretty heavily too. And we guess that the compares in the second half and they came down very shortly, very early so the competitor, is getting easier. So we think that would be a positive, we think Texas will continue to be pretty strong, Oklahoma should be positive, Arkansas should be positive, the big worry is Southeast Carolina's North Georgia in particular, Atlanta area, if you look at the volumes in the second quarter in the Carolina as we're talking about all 25% which is far beyond anything, we would just thought it some loss of confidence people pulling back and in Atlanta you crossed 35% reduction when we subtract out that quarries the same on same take away the Vulcan quarries purchase so that markets being grew last and in fact this climbing it now probably is reversed sense to meet 1970s.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: A good color did do you have data on shipments by end markets in the second quarter how did buckets do in terms of rays, non rays and infrastructure?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But we haven't calculated that to the year end we obviously keep tracker at money... reality is that risk continues to come down obviously to led lower base I will tell you that for the first time in probably 2.5 years I actually see a glimmer of hope in the residential sector. In looking down into the abyss, I think I could see a bomb, and I haven't been able to say that a long time. It would not surprise me that you begun to see some statistics, in fact you're seeing a few, that inter take that we're getting down towards the bottom, would not surprise me that you begun to see some positive statistics, as we get into in the middle of '09. I think inventory has probably peaked in terms of lots of inventory which is about 10, would not surprise me that, that number would be closure to eight by the middle of next year. Major home builders have really pulled back sharply in terms of what their doing, and from the standpoint of our business, the interesting thing is that they are sub-divisions, even at lower levels of sales that pull back so sharply, That sometimes next year probably about in the middle of the year they will have to begin to develop property again. Which is where a lot of our stone gets consorted. So clearly down more in the second quarter the infrastructure was the big pull back and it was... that was surprising but it was really driven by the price of liquid asphalt and the total construction cost. And I think the DOTs around the country get fluid when they saw asphalt anywhere from $650 to $850 a ton. And their view would be I can't buy much of that based on prices. I need to pull back because I have to but also expectation that that price level will come down. And I think they are correct in that regards. So I would expect as pricing comes down for asphalt, then we will see more activity there. Plus there is lot of activity at the state level, in addition to what we talked about several level, states are very active in trying to increase the revenue. They have to do it. The land is overwhelming; the question is how we raise the funds. It's not going to be through the gas tags it's going to be through other 60s and walk over heads which we'd talked about before and some today. Commercial work continues to be reasonably strong although we are seeing the pull back on retail. And we are seeing the pull back on office, which we've noted before. But capacity driven projects continue to go very strongly. So it's the least impacted sector right now, although in the leading indicators, certainly those don't get you excited. But I think that switch could flip back on pretty quickly because there are a lot of projects on the sidelines right now. The people are ready to go as soon as their confidence is up. So that's an anecdotal description of where I think we are.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Very good color there Steve. Maybe just lastly on transportation, are you seeing state DOTs as a plan for next year. Are they planning for similar amount of dollar funding? Or given what's happening with property taxes foreclosures, are you seeing lower spending main plan for next year?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We really don't really know yet. The DOTs hold that pretty close they're obviously assessing their in flows in gas tax, which is the primarily component of the revenue structure. And as you know that is being impacted you're seeing decline in consumption gasoline. And that is pushing them to go to other revenue sources. Not that a particular state is going to come back two years in a row. But what you're getting is sort of rotation right now. Where states are coming out. They are raising funds and other state does the same thing, Iowa just came out with $140 million of new revenue, in Iowa that's big money. And that will flow into the back half of this year, particularly into '09 Oklahoma recently came out with something they are in the 150s. Earlier in the year you Louisiana and Minnesota. You are getting a lot of positives there. The big ones of us its similar to what North Carolina does which is what highlighted in my remarks, very successful. And this recent succession and the constrain was there could be no new money. It had to be a reallocation of funds and we were successful in getting that done the legislature fund to be store that project because the needs just overwhelming. So they will have to put in front of them a very large basket that will be a 10 year program. I am going to guess that the numbers could be $8 million to $10 million of new money over 10 years. Resets what have been talked about now. And in addition potential toll road projects that might add another $6 million to $8 million or even more. So we would not talk it small change in North Carolina because in needs are driving it.
Unidentified Analyst: Great thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Betts from JP Morgan
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Yes, hi Steve. I had the three questions if I could. First one Steve if you could just talk a little bit about the Florida and what's happening to pricing now of these three quarries are open again?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We don't compete down the sort of two in Miami. We've got a little bit of business down there but nothing notable. We do compete with those quarries by layers they try to ship that to Orlando and up to Jacksonville. There were visions of another $5 increase, and you can cross that open off. And I don't think that's going to happen. They are trying to do so rebuilding with volumes with the quarries that were shutdown. Florida continues to have a pretty robust infrastructure program. The hurt has come on the concrete side as you can see with some excess of micro acquisition Small Rock. Interesting thing with the piece that we're involved in with... we look at internals of our South Georgia business because Florida because they are tied very closely together. If you take a piece of South Georgia that seems Florida our volumes were up in the second quarter and we picked up some price. Where the competition is for concrete business I'll tell you that has become very aggressive and we were seeing more aggressiveness down there between the players who, play that game, fortunately we're don't... we're not involved in significant piece of that. So we're not surprised either on the concrete side that, that's going to be a shoot out for a while.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: First $5, the one that was going up over '07, is that as far as you're aware of is still, and I guess you've got some knock on benefit from that, you haven't seen any sigh if that diminishing?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not really, I'm mean its there in times of the starting point, list prices and what volume discounts would be to the bog customers, but there's some middling around the edges where people are seeking volume, because the volumes are all so dramatically, that people get to appoint where they really would like to steal the volume from their competitor
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Okay. My second question, if I could was just on cost cutting. Hopefully we are reaching a trough in volumes. But if we did how further declines in volumes next year, is the further scope to that taking additional cost out of the business? Or have you done so much now that actually to be starting to damage the business for when things we recovered. I mean, now if you could just talk around that issue and give you some idea also maybe how much what you do is [indiscernible] since reactive on the cost cutting side?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We... obviously they are very aggressive in managing our cost a lot of prospect in the information systems we have which allow us to do things that we don't believe other producers can effectively did and react real time. If we were to have further significant volume decline in 2009 I think what you will see is us showing some plants working crews between two plants where we would run one crushing crew between two plates. And then we will have scale to load up people with the plates to keep them operating on it sales basis. So they're the offerings that we can do it. We've already talked the capital coming down, we did like to capitalized. We've done a nice job of giving ourselves set up with noble equipment this suggestive plant coming on is a huge plus for us in terms of being able to move more product where the market continues to be pretty robust. And also by giving customers some longer term guarantees on supply to blocking on some volume and some agreements there so we don't see that volume decline significant... volume decline coming right now. But we've got a long way to go to the end of the year so we reserve judgment till we get there. But no we haven't done everything we can do, we will continue to re-adjust. The only thing you can't adjust for is the hard fixed costs that go with the plant. The depreciation part of it, you're not going to be able to adjust it.
Unidentified Analyst: And the earlier Steve, you've mentioned the 15% reduction in annualized volumes over two years. How much of employees or your... I mean ideally [ph] cough blankets employees is a good guide. How much of your employees that you dropped over... those of the two years? I mean you gave the 12 month which I think you said was 7.5%. Could we double that so that the two years that you were talking about earlier with a 15% drop in production?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's not 15% but it's in the low teens.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you for that. And then the final question Steve, which is on taxes given the importance of it... one your bigger states I mean obviously part of the growth we're seeing this year is because of a bad weather a year ago. But I guess my real question here is, is there any sign of any slow down yet there either on the housing market or the other markets?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The answer is yes I don't... other than the Farmville I'm not sure that the there is any place which really immune to some slow down. That common is driven in different way; if you look at housing statistics you're seeing San Antonio, Houston, and even Dallas/Fort Worth back off. They're backing off from very high levels and there still is a very solid housing market there compared to other parts of the country but you are seeing diminishment. And with that you begin to potentially to see some pull back on commercial or retail construction, Texas non-residential particularly strong as part what's driving. The volume out there its not part of they are just a major component that's driving it. Infrastructure has been a mixed bag in Texas, a total side of the equation is going very well, the Texas DOT is funding challenge, shall we say, and they are pulling back accordingly to emerge expenditure to incoming cash so you are seeing something but certainly relatively strong compared to most of the parts in the contract. Stronger... less stronger in Southeast right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, now this is just about the final question, I should no the answer but apologies if I don't, the states in local funding how much of that is reliant on the gasoline tax as against other sources of funding roughly?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't give you a precise number because we have never wrapped it up by the states but if you followed we were talking about number it federal revenue its all gas tax, when you get to the states its not unusual that numbers 75% or better gasoline tax and I will tell you what things going to happen and this is the trust of the changes that recently have been may you are seeing the increases term with respect to vehicle transport taxes, sales tax and you are seeing it with respect to registration fees, title fees, in other words fixed fees one of the things we are talking about North Carolina is a vehicle miles travel assessment. And there is talk about that around the country we've got a construct we looking at its fairly straightforward, we think it easily collectible we are not on this political world implemented out, no but we are going to talk about it a lot we have not surprised me that we come forward with this recommendation over the next our views we are going to see a significant movement to fixed fees and vehicle miles traveled assessment gas tax simply weren't good.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay that's great thanks for those answers, Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We move next to Todd Vencil at Davenport & Company.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Thanks, hi guys. Steve I think your guidance on the volume of down three down six that was played at the volumes net of acquisitions and divestitures when there is acquisition how much of the acquisitions you've done so going to in.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The acquisitions are really moderate. You talked about partial year you were talking about 1% to over so change remember we divested too. I already told you what's up to the land market.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: All right. Okay thanks a lot and then I don't want to beat this gain I just want to make sure I understand it. Of the 16.4, 7.2 was continuing is that right it was split between those two groups?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: That's correct.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes it was--
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Land.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Land sale component which is part of our normal business.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: But I mean the income statement, the 7.2 is above the law and the 9.2 is below right?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Correct.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: And then turning the... turn of the price increases you said you're getting price virtually everywhere and then you came back and said roughly the same thing, is there any place that you're not getting it that surprisingly to you or you're just not getting anything at all.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No I'm actually quite surprised that we're successful as we've been, that we're able to get some price relief, pretty much cost more, because when we started out, beginning of the year, we didn't think we would be able to that, in fact you're call come out first quarter, we bumped our flash range to 50 basis points up.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Good work and congratulations on that, you talked about a couple of quarters about the fact that you were shipping mix away from some of you're long horn markets and maybe loosing some place just due to mix shift in terms of what the average was coming up to be, did you see that in the quarter.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, not merely to a signed agreement, geographic mix was a big piece of first quarter as was the transportation mix, transportation mix is more normalized. And geographic mix still as a negative for us in fact we go through the calculation as we had same geographic mix in the second quarter we had last year, we are not so share more.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: Okay, and couple housekeeping items, you talked about CapEx expense can you talk about tax rate and full year DD&A going to okay?
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Yes, Todd full year DD&A right around $165 million the tax rate should be 31 to 31.5.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: And you told that couple of times the cost and you guys are doing really going to pay out when you state before time we start to taking up volume you kind of easily with that on what you think the housing markets were engaged when do you think the time frame is going to be when you start to see some more volume?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well its certainly too early to be definitive, but if we begin to see a break housing market in the second half of next year and obviously that's a lead. My view of the non-res side is that it's going to respond much quicker. To what's going on in housing and in fact my respond definitive based on investor confidence because if you still look at if you go back and look at the non-res construction it continues to be behind the home building. So those two thing could move pretty simultaneously even at the near of the non-res could move in a positive manner quarter before res positively transparent. But I think the key thing is going to be the infrastructure piece. I really believe we are at the state of the contract that with the politics or calling for significant change much more state of the country. And the democrats are articulating that very well and it's easily resonating with American public. And it will not surprise me for November they are going to make some promises but people don't hold it accountable for it will be positive for our industry. Being the customer... the way to take this industry forward is to have confidence structure. Because even with housing going back I mean lets be realistic I want it back to market rate of $2.4 million stats probably in the next two maybe three cycles. Am going back to the annualized rate of $2.1 million you might get back to something to that's in the 1.7, 1.8 this sort of the peak rate, 1.5, 1.6 more likely. So if its certainly up more than it is right now. But its' not going back to where it was I don't think for at least two circles out. So it puts more emphasis on infrastructure and more emphasis on average opportunistic capacity driven non-residential projects. The America really has to rebuild its capacity be it transportation or other types of things that we produce.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Co.: All right thanks for that.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure
Operator: We will move next to Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc: Good afternoon. Quickly, you mentioned in the press release large industrial commercial jobs are these projects that you've already started, are they project that are in the pipe coming up or can you give us some color on that?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: With respect to large commercial and industrial jobs we got those kinds of opportunities that are out there across country. A lot of energy driven. And if you were to go I mentioned Iowa was roughly robust farm economy. But Iowa is kind of a energy state and we continue to have a very robust business out there with Wind Farm projects ours number three producer of wind generated electricity and is ramping up sort of. So I think that's going to be a positive. We talked previously about the expansion LNG terminals and refineries, we talked about steel mill expansion, we talked about foreign automotive expansion which we had recently announced plant that's going into Chattanooga, and you have the [indiscernible] plant in Mississippi, those are nice opportunities you've got all these appear to be big projects we're going to take well built out. So they're going to give a stimulus to our business because whether we or competitors get that work and typically it was split up further. It serves the capacity in the market and keeps people busy which is always a plus chance to take pressure of people getting extremely price aggressive trying to seek volume for plants that just don't have any. So with this lies your key absolutely key you want. Other positive note that I'll give you since I have talked toll roads which are four plus in North Carolina the letting took place this week on the new work I mentioned in Valley and there were two projects led. The first of those projects was a small one it has about a half million tons of aggregate on it. We have been told that we were first in aggregate the second project is about a million and half tons its a much larger project. We went out there for months there. But in expectation that we'll flush some portion to it. So that those kinds of opportunities don't come along all that often. Half million ton project is a very big project.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc: Great thanks. Thanks for that. And then also with the 24 million incurred to control inventory levels I think that this is kind of an ongoing initiatives can you take a step at what that impact might be in the third quarter or fourth quarter?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we are much better balanced. As we go forward through the year, I believe that we took our big hit in the second quarter, where we really jammed all the breaks hard. Expectation is that we are going to be fairly well at balances we go to rest of the year. So I'd say we might not have some fixed costs in the joint IPO, and surely. But I don't think it's going to be at the similar magnitude.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc: Okay, that's all I've got. Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next we go to Clyde Lewis with Citi.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Hi, good afternoon Steve. If I may... I probably should know that the west region Cannon was the lowest price increase. Can you just sort of run through the reasons down that suspected for this an exchange but this time we are going to check on that.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The mix changes so our preserve it your well material is being shifting within that region you have transportation mix which is improved. But if you look at the pricing will Texas was very strong and particularly the net of the quarter where we shift some very low price material we represent in the first quarter. So the expectation out there has not been on this we are going to get first of all starting point was we are not going to get the level of price increases we've seen and Southeast. And its just for economies we predict you get more competitors varies in to the... as high and the pricing reflects that for see we have some very low cost material and low priced material in and master card [ph] a cliché which we referred to before, which is a $2, $2.5 material. And the market for that is quite good right now. So that's really what's impacting
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. The other operating income, in two-twos, a very good number, I suspect it probably $ 1000, but can you give us a little bit of... and remind us what's in there and what's you're expectation you got from the folio.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Again those are typically land sales, their probably the $7.2 million and there's land sales that we've deal in the bulk and asset exchange. You'll have some used equipment, that gets sold in there, the run rate element run anywhere from $12 to $15 million a year if you recover last three to five, and we are gaining different than that this year.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay, so that's 7.2 is in not 7.6, topped up in the gross profit is it.
Anne H. Lloyd - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer: Correct.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay, okay and the other two obviously was slightly bigger picture on one was on sort of concrete roads versus sort of asphalt roads given the spike in natural prices or [indiscernible] prices, other DOTs consider turnarounds say well let's build concrete roads instead and taking around that market?
C. Howard Nye - President and Chief Operating Officer: We'd certainly look at it. The problem you have with concrete roads is liability, people where they take trips don't enjoy noise that typically is going with the concrete roads they don't enjoy the Sean joint, say you get into a liability issues which the consumer has a biased because the asphalt roads are much quieter and a smoother ride now the concrete industry is obviously working very hard to convince the DOTs otherwise. But the DOTs are at the end of day they are political animals that they have to survive in that environment and if they are not pleasing the driving consumer then they have a problem and you can go around the country and it's not hard to find anecdotal situations where the DOTs left concrete in the major roadways and regret it and then soon they are after the fury of consumer complaints. So economically it make all sense worldwide and it's cheaper initial build right now to build with concrete and certainly lifecycle concrete construction costs is far below that line crossed over to 2007 and it's heavily weighed to concert I think where you might see it where it really has an advantage, if you take parking lots if you are aware about and you are custom to putting down after all parking lot you pretty quickly going to ask the question why am I doing it versus putting an contract which is additionally cheaper and its going last being a long, longer so if the economics in the where and close proximity I think you are going to see a lot of non risk projects move away from parking lots to concert parking lots and that can happen very quickly.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay. The last one I have is on margins I mean where are United and comes the Europe full of your 10 margin improvement out of those who have a favorable period I mean are you still hoping to get that by 2010 with this sort of more stable market in 09 and you think that's actually going to be pushed out into transfer the alignment 2012?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes I think it's going to be pushed out. I think we have to be realistic about that risk. Now this thing is deeper and more pronounced in certainly than we expected, I am going to frame for you in a little different way, you talked more about this as we go if you go back to the period 2002 to 2007, we increased margins, 1,134 basis points and you can compare to our primary competitors and I think you will agree we did a pretty good job, if you take the period going from 2007 to 2012 for the next five year period, the expectation is even though we are moving backward right now, that we are going to do that again we are going be 1,000 plus basis points during that period. From 2005 the different point we've been looking at to 2010, we are not going to get there simply because we should, but 2011 measured on that basis. I think we've got a shot at getting there. And being a statistical jerky, I like to look at these things and sort of break them apart. If you go back and look at 2002 to 2007, we essentially got that done in most of bulk of it in a 3 year period. And most of it at 2 years so it's not going to surprise me that the same thing plays out over the course of the next five years. You don't get a lot when volume turns margins are going to ramp very significantly.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks so much.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Brown at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. Just wondering how much your liquid asphalt costs have come down so far in this quarter.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well first of all we are not big asphalt guys we are into the third quarter and not appropriate to speak in the third quarter and the second quarter at the first half of the year, liquid asphalt cost started the year and in most prices as a good average will be about $400 plus and by the end of the second quarter, those numbers were 650-700 with larger increases promise as people came into the third quarter and we interestingly whether not does stick, how long stick.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We haven't seen any, we haven't getting any letters from anyone or any of our customers telling us with liquid asphalt has backed up.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then the second question is just in Iowa and Iowa and the whole Midwest I would assume there has to be a lot of maintenance in rebuilding has to be done at to the flooding and do you expect to recover any of that volume in the second half or even first half of '09 and are you seeing any increased demands on that?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I don't think there's going to be hugely impact for rebuilding tonnage you Cedar Rapids was most impacted and Cedar Rapids is not a large place the downtown area was pretty much destroyed and question is to whether or not to even rebuild that there or just relocate I think the economy out there is so strong that it was more of a disruption of what would have been an exceptional volume popper that was the issue and as we go into Q3 and Q4 we think volumes are going to be very strong there regardless what goes on within any reconstruction work I don't think reconstruction is going to be the driver, just going to be the stronger comment in there.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And next we go to David Macgregor from Longbow Research.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Steve just a couple of quick ones, you had talked about CapEx being down next year, what is the maintenance CapEx number that we should be thinking about for amount merrier than today.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well maintenance CapEx for us typically around DD&A and given you that number about 165, which is up, its inclusive of the acquisitions that we did predominantly the Vulcan pick up of the Vulcan coast
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay. Can you quantify the mid-year price increase?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Actually if I wanted to I could take you through our area and tell you exactly what they are, but I'm not going to do that for you.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: No.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They were modest single digit overall, they were some spots where we got some double digit, very selectively.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But that was unusual
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay. And then--
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: At some places you just nibble that you got a very small single digit increase.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay, you talked about the Atlanta volumes picking up 35% which I guess is pretty extreme can you talk just a little bit about what happened in the placing in the phase of the 35% volume decline?
C. Howard Nye - President and Chief Operating Officer: Our market is become much more competitive, versus what it was. At the same time I will go back in time and look at this industry and if you had that kind of volume decline in another year everything in the industry was production oriented turn to cost it imported I think you would see significant pricing decline in that market. The fact is you are not seeing it. You're seeing a lost competitive pricing job by job, particular where there is volume. But frankly you're not seeing what I would call financially irrational behavior in case you sit back and you do the analysis and given the put on out there you're not going to create in more tones and wind up but whacking your price of dollars, $2 a ton. So where in you can be covered and pick up little work from our competitor I'm sure everybody would like to do that but at the same time you don't want to destroy the pricing you've to have. So its fine line because you destroy the pricing structure by buck or $2 and all of a certain the land becomes in place where people are not making much money if they need at all.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks very much
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure
Operator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time I'll turn the conference back over to Stephen Zelnak for any closing remarks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay thanks for joining us a lot of questions and hopefully we've done a good job of answering them. We try to give you a lot of specifics and some antidotes to help you understand what's going on in the industry. It is a difficulty time we are working our way through it I think very effectively and we opportunity to taste the value of increase overall and that point things will get much enjoyable. If you have any individual questions feel free to call us and we look forward to reporting back to you at the end of next quarter. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference, again thank you for your participation.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-06 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and CEO C. Howard Nye - President and COO
Analysts: Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company Garik Shmois - Longbow Research Stuart Friou - Hunter Global John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets
Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Incorporated, First Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Zelnak. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for joining us this afternoon. I have with me Howard Nye, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Anne Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer. We were very pleased with our first quarter results in what is a challenging environment. Expected slow start to the construction season was exacerbated by server winter weather in our northern states along with drought ending rains in March in North Georgia and North Carolina. Revenue of $399 million was down 3% with volume in our Heritage aggregates business declining 8% versus a planned decrease of 5%. Heritage aggregates pricing was up 4% exceeding our expectations, which anticipated a geographic and transportation mix at favored lower priced areas. Earnings per diluted share was $0.50 versus $0.73 in the prior year period. Even with volume weaker than expected in our aggregates business, we were able to generate better than planned operating earnings through excellent cost management. Also we were able to reduce SG&A at 2% compared to the prior year period. Energy costs reflected the run up in oil pricing with diesel fuel up $6.2 million or 35% compared to the prior year period, this reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. The big positive for us was the performance of our Specialty Product segments with both, our dolomitic lime business and our magnesia chemicals business performing at a high level. The segment contributed record first quarter sales and earnings with revenue up 11% and operating earnings up 23%. We also achieved a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. During the quarter we completed two small acquisitions. We acquired assets of the Specialty Magnesia Division of Morton International in February, which will enable us to produce and market ElastoMag, which inhibits premature hardening of rubber components in the molding process. We also purchased a small quarry south of Asheboro, North Carolina. This quarry has 40 million tons of reserves and will enable us to provide a full range of high quality products to customers in the area. In April, we completed the purchase of five active quarries and one green side location from Vulcan Materials. Four of the quarries are in the greater Atlanta area, which roughly doubles our presence in North Georgia. The other active quarry is well located to serve the Chattanooga, Tennessee area. The integration of these operations into Martin Marietta has been seamless to-date. This reflects the high quality of our people along with the flexibility of our information systems in accommodating growth opportunities. And looking ahead we continue to have a positive outlook for our business in 2008 despite the challenging economic environment. Based on the sharp increase in energy cost we anticipate more mid year price increases than originally planned. Accordingly, we are raising our target for aggregates pricing to increase in the 6% to 8% range. We continue to expect volume to be in a range of up 1% to down 3% for the year. We also continue to expect record operating earnings from Specialty Products in the $36 million to $38 million range. With these expectations, we reaffirm our range for net earnings per diluted share of $6.25 to $7. At this time I'd be pleased to take any questions that you may have? Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Arnie Ursaner with CJS Securities.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Hi, good afternoon. Steve could you try to quantify whether there was any revenue contribution from the business, Specialty Products business you bought, and if so perhaps give us some feel for an annualized revenue number?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Annualized revenue number will probably be, plus $5 million, so it's not a big acquisition. It's a niche opportunity that fits very well with what we already do. Revenue in the first quarter was inconsequential.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Okay. And again on the acquisition you made of the granite quarry in North Carolina, you mentioned it had 40 million tons of reserve. What sort of annual production are you expecting from that mine?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's going to be relatively small. It's in a more rural market area. And probably we'd get that one up into the 0.5 million ton range or so, in a not too distant future.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Okay. And my final question if I can, is obviously the pricing of aggregates. You've moved up your target a little bit. Is that for hope for price increases and increases you've already announced and specifically with the properties you are buying in Georgia, which have probably been a little under priced have you built in an expectation for increases in Georgia in that number?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: In some cases, we have already announced some increases that were not originally planned. In other cases, we are planning to do that. Areas where we think we have some opportunity, we'll continue to look at Florida. South Carolina is an opportunity, Alabama is an opportunity, North Georgia, certainly we think is an opportunity. At the same time we are looking across the board in our company, because what we've seen is a tremendous price escalation on diesel, and we would certainly like to recover that if at all possible. So we are looking at it a little bit differently than we were prior to the diesel run-up, even though markets are tough in some places, we've got some cost that we need to pass on.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: On diesel, are you hedging your position?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No.
Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities: Okay. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Todd Vencil with Davenport & Company.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Hi, Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. Good afternoon rather.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Yeah. It goes quick, doesn't it? Have you… and pardon me if you've disclosed this, and I just can't remember, we talked about the volume expectations from the quarter that you guys got from Vulcan?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The volume expectations there on annualized basis are going to be in roughly four million ton range.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Okay. And just in general, I mean, you gave some color obviously I think in the release. But you talked about what you are seeing out there probably speaking of the state budgets I mean is it in the last three months has there been kind of a major shift in your expectation there on the highway side?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly states are under more pressure. I don't think that's a mystery known to all of us. What we are seeing is some states that are really beginning to struggle with that, we have seen other states that have stepped forward and done some things to improve their funding situation. Notable recently Louisiana which has increased funding coming out of a special session and we think that's going to very positive for us in the second half of the year on out through the next five years. Minnesota which is not an area that we are big in, but one where we have a nice presence. Minnesota legislature recently increased their funding sharply over $600 million annually. So we are going to see some kick there. Our highway projects are going better than expected. The big worry for us is that North Carolina continues to lag in its highway program. There is an effort underway to address that within the state, but I am not sure that's going to happen until 2009. So that's probably the biggest concern that we have.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: And in Louisiana I think you talked about Minnesota, the gas that's increased in Minnesota, is that correct?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They had a package of different entries as of our [inaudible]
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: How they swing it in Louisiana? Was there also a package?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, they had a surplus to start with which is a very good place to start from.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Absolutely.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So they allocated some surplus and went from there.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Okay and then just in general on the non-residential side, I mean I guess expectations there soft in the last two months as well?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Its very similar to what we have talked about for the last six months or so. You have what I call the capacity driven projects, which continue to go well, there is a lot of activity. And then you have the retail sector, and to some degree the office construction sector, that cooled off and probably will continue to do so. When you look at capacity projects, we've mentioned the FedEx hub in Greensboro. At LNG projects, oil and gas drilling that requires stone for roadways. The energy component of that is just on fire with wind farms, ethanol has pulled back a little bit, but it's still a strong component in the mix. In the Midwest, it was even there couple of years back. So I continue to like the vision between capacity driven projects, and those that are truly more deferrable based on the economy.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: All right, thanks a lot.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Hi good afternoon. Just wondering if you could talk about pricing in the West Group is relatively flat year-over-year. What are your expectations as we move through 2008 out there?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It will improve. The pricing in the first quarter really reflects the mix of business we have. We have some extensive tonnage relatively low price material, we mine a material out there called kalitchee [ph] which is used as base material, and that product may sell in the $2 to $3 range as opposed to normal aggregate prices. We've got some big work there with wind farm project that dominates in terms of western pricing. Also the transportation mix more of the shipments there came from truck quarries as opposed to being transported and then resold at distribution yards. So the transportation mix tended to bring that down.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. And in the Mideast, another tough quarter with respect to volumes, and I imagine much of that is due to weakness along the Great Lakes. But is there anything that you are seeing out there that could reverse the trend, either one way or the other, more positively or more negatively?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, let's take the Great Lakes out of it, because we don't service the Great Lakes area. We do operate in Indianapolis and we operate in Dayton, Cincinnati area in the northern climates. As we look at that area up there and look at this Mideast component, which also includes Virginia, Maryland, it comes down through North and South Carolina, we actually believe that the Indiana, Ohio component probably is going to bottom out about midyear. We've got some pretty good work coming in second half. So, I would expect in the second half in that area we'd begin to see some positive volume comparison. In Virginia, Maryland, actually that business is going well. We were up 3% on volume in the first quarter. We are expecting a good year up there, a positive year throughout. North Carolina and South Carolina are much weaker. Part of that was weather in the first quarter. We actually were down on volume in the Carolinas, 27%, which is mammoth. And I can tell you the economy has softened, but nothing like that. So, a significant wet weather component. The interesting thing about that is that even though our volume was down 27%, our unit margin was up 18%. So, you can intuit pricing and cost control out of that. We did an awfully good job of running that business. So, I feel confident that we will put up good numbers in that area, albeit with a lesser volume than we would like to see.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Stuart Friou with Hunter Global.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Yeah, Steve, just a question. It seems like in the last two years, the first quarter has been about 12% of your annual earnings. And if we kind of do that math this year, we get kind of well below where you are guiding to. What is so different this year about the seasonality that was not the case in '06 and '07?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: '06 and '07 were really the anomalies. We had an economy that was completely on fire, particularly with the homebuilding component, which even stretched over into '07. If you go back in time and look at us as a public company, it was not unusual, but we lost money in the first quarter.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Right.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So, it was a negative contributor. So as you look at this year, the dynamic is that you have an economy that's softer. The expectation was that there would be very little homebuilding activity, which is one of those things in most parts of the country that you can work on during the winter, because you can't pour winter concrete and put down winter base. We just knew that wasn't going to be there. So, the work was going to be bunched up much more infrastructure work, asphalt-related big project. And we looked at the timing of those, and it was pretty clear to us that the first quarter was going to be a very slow start. So, for planning purposes, we actually set up a plan to keep plants down longer in a non-operating status. We did that very successfully in the first quarter. Our sales were down 8%, but compared to prior year, our production was 13%. And normally, what we do in the first quarter is we outproduce the sales, because we are building inventory. This year, we don't see the need to do that. So, we actually produced and sold it very close to same rate. So, we just planned the quarter differently. And in fact, it worked out better than we planned, but nonetheless, different from the last two years.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Okay. And what's kind of your view on, I guess, volume and pricing in that relationship? I mean at what point does declining volume impact your ability to raise prices?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly, it's already impacted it, because if you look the rates of price increase we were getting last year and the year before, they are considerably higher than our estimate of 6% to 8% this year. So, directionally, you are seeing the opportunity for pricing come down just as you would expect. The economy continues to drift downward. It would tend to reduce that opportunity. At the same time, if you go back in history prior to this last run-up in the cycle, we only averaged 3%. And I would be very surprised if we go down to 3% with any kind of scenario that we think is foreseeable. So, just back to the premise in aggregate, you have got a better pricing environment based on supply, demand. And certainly for the foreseeable future, we expect that even in a downturn.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Okay. So pricing is up 4% in the first quarter. What are you seeing out there in the second, third quarters that would get us to 6% to 8% for the whole year? I mean is there announced pricing rates you've already have taken or you are expecting the business to improve in the back half?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Now, these are basically things that are put in place. What you get is a shifting of the mix back to something that is more normal in terms of where it's coming from. The transportation mix will lean more heavily toward the long haul in the latter three quarters of the year. So, you will get out of the mix part of the issue. And as I had mentioned earlier, we do expect to have greater midyear price increases than we had originally programmed. So, that would give a little impetus in the back half.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: So, the North Carolina, for example, pricing will get better in the back half of the year than it is today if we take the mix out of the equation, just look at apples-to-apples?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, in North Carolina, what we've done is we've agreed that we'll only go and raise prices one time. So that's been put into effect. And what will happen as you go is you get the impact of the one-time increase. But as jobs that you quoted in earlier times are completed, you're going to replace that with a higher price on new work quoted [ph] and shipped.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So you get some continuing momentum based on the nature of this business.
Stuart Friou - Hunter Global: Okay. Thank you.
C. Howard Nye - President and Chief Operating Officer: Sure.
Operator: And moving next to Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.
John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Good afternoon, Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jack.
John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: I wanted to ask about the Texas housing market in particular. What you are seeing in there, housing market that's relatively speaking held up well. But with a slower economy and slower job growth, do you see any risk on the housing side in Texas?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's pulled back, certainly no mystery in that one. You can look at the figures by major metro. Houston held up about as long as anywhere, and it has pulled back noticeably. San Antonio, likewise, the area that continues to be the strongest at least where we are and the areas where we ship is Dallas-Fort Worth market. So, we continue to see strength there, although it is down. There are no major metro markets in Texas, but it's better than the rest of the country by and large.
John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: And the state DOT there seem to be wrestling with whether or not to toll road projects, what... they seem to be a back and forth there. What's your view on Texas Public Works?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They've caught the North Carolina virus. They've hit [Inaudible] accounting. If you recall, North Carolina a couple of years ago had a major accounting mistake. Texas finds that it's not accounting too well either. So, they are trying to reconcile cash flows. The nice part is that there is a lot of toll work. And we think we are going to be very, very busy, particularly in Dallas, Fort Worth. And there is big toll project in San Antonio also. So, we feel about infrastructure in Texas, but some of the work is going to get pushed out, and the legislature is going to have to decide between, toll, no toll, public-private partnerships, just how they want to play the funding game for their infrastructure needs, which are immense. And they've got over 300,000 miles of roadway in Texas.
John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: I was going to ask too about share repurchase program. Could you update us on how much you have left on the current authorization? In the press release, you guys mentioned you're at 2.3 times coverage, still very comfortable with some acquisitions behind, particularly the anticipated ones with Vulcan. Would you be back in the market buying shares?
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've got about 5.2 million shares left on our authorization, so certainly no issue there. What we had said last year was we were going to wait and see whether or not we had any success with these assets that Vulcan was spinning off. And in fact, the piece that we were interested in, we did have success on. We are at 2.3. We'll just play that out through the year and try to see how everything is going. If it goes the way we think it's going to go, then we will be generating a lot of free cash. What we've said is we're not going to pile that up for any period of time on the balance sheet. So, we're either going to use it and some other acquisition opportunity, if there is a good one or the logical thing to do would be look at share buyback again. So one or the other or a combination.
John Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over management for any additional or closing remarks.
Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks for joining us. Pretty brutal cold quarter in a lot of ways, but certainly I feel like our operating people just did a fantastic job, and I want to publicly acknowledge that. We are going to answer the rest of the year. We've got a lot to get done. But based on what we know at this point in time, we think it's there and we're going to work hard to put it on the bottomline. Look forward to talking to you in the month of July.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Zelnak. Please go ahead sir.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for joining us today. I have with me Ward Nye, President and Chief Operating Officer and Anne Lloyd, our Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter turned out to be much more challenging than we expected. Through October-November our aggregates volume was positive by 1% and our results were well on track for another record quarter. In December, weather issues in the Middle East, Mid-West and Mid Atlantic areas created a 19% drop in volume and northern tier states from Iowa to West Virginia saw declines that range from 23% to over 50% as construction activity came to a quick halt for the year. In North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland shipments were down 28%. As you expect, the drop of that magnitude coupled with rising energy prices, which cost us $0.09 per share, had a very negative impact on profitability and margins. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share of $1.30 was down $0.20 from the prior year period. Heritage aggregates volume was down 5%, while pricing increased 5.5%. The geographic mix, which was much more heavily weighted to truck markets in the west, reduced the rate of sales price change by about 150 basis points. Our dolomitic lime business performed particularly well during the quarter, while our magnesia chemical's business showed continuing growth. In our Aggregates business, we saw positive volume growth during the quarter in Iowa, North Texas and Oklahoma, Arkansas and East Texas as well as in South Georgia. During the quarter, we did a particularly good job of managing our SG&A expense, which declined almost $2 million or 5%. We continue to streamline our organization for a reduction of some 40 jobs in the SG&A area. Our continuing investment in information systems technology is enabling us to create more effective ways to accomplish necessary task. For the full year 2007, we turned in some notable achievements, despite difficult economic conditions. Earnings per diluted share of $6.06, was up 15% to a record level. Record EBITDA of $591 million increased 10% from the prior year. Record operating margin based on net sales increased 180 basis points for the year, and it was up 440 basis points over the past two years. Return on equity increased 370 basis points to a record 24%. All of this was accomplished against an 8% decline in Aggregates volume, which is the shortest volume contraction we have experienced since the 10% decline in 1991. During the year, we adopted a new capital structure with leverage target of 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. We finished 2007 slightly under the target, but expect to be in the target range in 2008. During the year, we repurchased 4.2 million shares, which included 604,000 shares in fourth quarter. Since beginning of 2005, we have repurchased about 18% of our shares, which we believe has been very beneficial to our shareholders. At the same time, we've been investing at record levels to expand our business with some very high return projects. Examples of such projects, which typically have IRRs of 25% or more, are recently completed new plants and underground mine at Weeping Water, Nebraska, which increases annual capacity from 2 million tons to close to 4 million tons. Also, our new Augusta, Georgia plant is underway with completion scheduled in early 2009. It will take annual capacity from 2 million tons to 6 million tons. We'll continue to invest in these types of growth and efficiency improvement projects. We also doubled our magnesium hydroxide powder productions in our Magnesia Chemicals business, which is a very attractive investment, given the growth in demand for flame retardant and additives. Looking ahead at 2008, we expect a challenging year, given the uncertainly in credit markets. We expect housing to drop significantly in the first half followed by bottoming in the second half. Most of the non-residential construction will be solid with energy projects, and other capacity expansion construction being strong and retail and office construction softening. Infrastructure demand should grow modestly, as overwhelming demand chases funding. Geographically, we expect North Texas, San Antonio, NAFTA corridor, South Georgia and Iowa to be the strongest areas. Iowa was interesting because it's not an area of notable population growth. However, wind initiatives including wind farms, ethanol and bio-fuel plants along with robust farm economy should make for a good year. In our Specialty Products segment, we expect further growth in Magnesia Chemicals and also a very positive volume growth in our dolomitic lime business. The year in Aggregates, we expect the rate of price increase to range between 5.5% to 7.5% with the volume change ranging between up 1% to down 3%. With Specialty Products, we expect pretax earnings at $36 million to $38 million versus $33 million in 2007. Given these assumptions, we expect diluted earnings per share to be a record, $6.25 to $7, the first half been relatively weak with notable improvements in the second half. At this time, I will be pleased to take any questions which you may have. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We move first to Mike Betts with JP Morgan.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Yes. Steve, just a couple of questions if I could from me. Firstly, could you maybe just comment a bit more on the success of the price increases at the start of this year. And secondly, could you give some idea of the underlying assumptions that you've made in cost inflation in our guidance of the year. And I guess what I am particularly interested in, if you could maybe talk about the growth number; you see cost going up, and then some indication of how much you're able to reduce that increase through the various initiatives that you've got going. Thank you very much.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We do have in place our 2008 pricing. We have certain areas where the price levels like price increase will be very positive double-digit. The greatest opportunities we have in 2008 are in the Carolinas and down through Florida. When you get to other areas of the country, you are going to see much more modest price increases in the mid single-digits. They are ranging down to low single-digits in some of the markets that are pretty depressed; low single-digit markets would be places like Ohio, Indiana where demand is relatively low. So that's where the pricing shapes up for 2008.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: And Texas, Steve where would that be?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Texas ought to be in the mid single-digits, but the caveat there is that Texas is greatly influenced by the balance of shipments between the long-haul transport shipments and the truck quarries because the difference in pricing is very significant, could be as much as 3:1 in some cases. So depending on what that balance is, it will affect the average price in Texas, either up or down, depending upon how that compares to 2007. So I just leave you with that caveat with respect to Texas. We think that Texas marketplace is going to be a good marketplace in '08. We particularly think that North Texas is going to be strong. We expect good business in San Antonio and the NAFTA corridor, we think Houston will be a bit more challenging but overall, I think a nice year. East Texas, which is predominately rural, is also a good market place for us and we think that's going to be a good place in 2008. Yes, with respect to cost inflation, Mike, it's always interesting to look back on where you've been and then try to figure it out. In 2007, we were dead on with our projections with respect to energy through the first three quarters and obviously, the fourth quarter huge ramp up in the energy cost and as we indicated that cost was $0.09 a share and not anything that you are going to react to in the short term. You just have to eat it. As we look at 2008 with the items other than energy that are variable in nature, I think we are going to be somewhere in the 4%, 5% range. They are not totally variable and that's what will push it up a little bit, but the big issue for 2008 is really going to be volume levels and production through the plants that go with that and fixed cost amortization. If you look at our depreciation, depreciation is ramping up for us and that is a function of our decision to invest in our business where we see some great opportunities, but the timing of that is not necessarily dead on. So we may have a few spots where we don't have as much volume as we'd like to amortize that investment. Just for you to put in your calculation for 2008, the DD&A that we are looking at is going to be about $165 million versus about a $150 million in 2007. The run rate fourth quarter 2007 was about $157 million. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: It is, thank you for that, Steve. Just one more question if I could, because one of the questions of 2008 is the budgetary situation of your three major states, the two Carolinas and Texas and certainly the risk section of your press release mentions these. How serious do you see that. Are you seeing any cut back or threats to cut backs in highway program in those 3 big states because of that?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Texas has already taken some actions, but at the same time, there is an offset there with the toll road program. So we think overall, Texas is going to be pretty strong and I am not particularly concerned about that. South Carolina has a new finish for progress program, which is pumping some more money into that state and South Carolina as we view it right now, is going to be okay. North Carolina has come forward with the initial $300 million worth Garvey bonds. That helps, but the reality is that North Carolina is going to have to do more and we are in the throws right now, politically trying to determine exactly what it is that the state is going to do. So I think in 2008 North Carolina in the highway sector is going to be down a bit. We'll see whether or not legislature takes interim action during the year to put some more money into the highway funds. I don't know the answer to that right now, but there is a major effort underway to come forward for the recommendation to the legislature. The Governor has a state commission to do that, which will report by May.
Mike Betts - JP Morgan: Okay, that's great. Thank you very much Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next we move on to Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks, good afternoon Steve.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
Hey Jack:
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Hey. I wanted to ask first, do you think housing will be as big a drag in '08 for your business as it was in '07?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes it is, it will be non- existent based on the rate of decline. Our expectations are that, with the Federal Reserve's aggressive actions and what we would expect to see from them, they are going to alleviate some of what might otherwise happen. But if you look at your inventory overhang, it is going to take a while to work it off. And I would expect in the first half of the year, that you're going to see starts drop down to could be 850,000 to 900,000 units. As you go through to the back half of the year, I expect the bottom to perk up just a little bit, to get the year back to something that's closer to million units, hopefully a little better than that. But as you know, historically after the Fed gets aggressive with rates one way or the other, about 6 months out you begin to see some impact, and not that inventory is going to clear that quickly, but builders will go back to work and you have to remember that builders build, someone will win them... win their money they will build houses. And I think the environment should be much better in the second half of that.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: And I was also going to ask about in the fourth quarter, if you look at your volume and price performance by the way you break it up your three segments geographically, the second one that was down most in volume in the Middle East was up most in price and the segment that was up, up most in volume was worst price performance you wanted to say at that way up, the West only up 1.3%. Could you talk about what's going... what goes on there, what figures into those dynamics?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, the Mid East is a pretty broad swath of territory and it does include Indiana and Ohio, which economically both of those are put into the category of basket cases. Certainly, we saw a very significant volume declines in both, and Indiana for the year, volume down about 15%; Ohio, volume down 27%. So those volume changes that you're seeing in Mid East are heavily driven by the automotive build in Indiana and Ohio. If you go out to the west and look at that correlation between the two, it comes back to where the business was. We had a very good year in South Texas, but South Texas has some very low price material. Some nice margins in it, but very low price material and also we had much more truck quarry sales relative to the long-haul transportation and just to give you an example, the truck sales might be on the order of $6, $7 a ton. If you put it on, later I will go through this distribution yard that number maybe up in the $17 to $18 range. So when you weight it all out, we had a mix shift there that was pretty significant plus the ramp-up in the NAFTA corridor down to South Texas. So on the surface, it looks like there is a direct correlation, actually there are a lot of reasons behind that and it's not nearly as direct as the economist might think.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. And then last, I wanted to just ask with regard to the 2008 pricing guidance of 5.5% to 7.5%, would you think that if they were toward the low end of that range 5.5% or so percent that would be the low rate of increase for the cycle?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Given what's going on, if the Fed continues to be as aggressive as they have been and if you got a stimulus package thrown over the wall of the American consumer, you would expect that you are going to get some stimulus coming into the election, but that is going to carry over around to 2009. Given that, I'll say absolutely, that's the low point, but I think you are beginning to coast along the bottom more than likely.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets: Right, okay. Thank you very much
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Moving on, the next question will come from Todd Vencil with Davenport & Company.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Hi, thanks a lot. On that $0.09 energy impact that you mentioned, just to clarify, is that relative to your expectation or is that on a year-over-year basis?
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Year-over-year, Todd.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Okay, thanks a lot. And then, just a sort of get a little more general, I mean, what was really driving a shift in the mix away from the higher priced material, which I guess is the long-haul material? Was that... is that weather or was that some sort of geographic shift?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Of course geographic and if you look at the long-haul markets, they are... most of the markets in the South East and Gulf Coast. And as you know, those markets have certainly pulled back. Housing was a major driver for significant piece of it. They've been pulling back and we just saw it in a more pronounced way and we continue to see diminishing in demand in those custom markets, but also we saw some increase in demand in other areas that were truck market, where we have truck market quarries. So it all comes back to the nature of this business, which is very local and we happen to get demand in places like Iowa, and Nebraska and South Texas, and we didn't have as much demand in Houston and some other Florida markets and down in the Gulf Coast.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Alright. So given that, I mean do you sort of anticipating that's going to persist for a while and is that just sort of in your pricing guidance?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The answer is yes. We think that probably going to persist. The nice thing about the coastal markets as we go out is that people continue to flow in. The problem they have is selling their house where they are coming from or wanting to make the plunge on a new and if they don't, already own one. So, we think that's going to continue for a while ahead. I cited the Midwest in my comments particularly Iowa, I'll put Nebraska with that. Some very interesting factors influencing that area which will make it very positive. We think the South Texas market is going to very positive, lot of wind farm activity in South Texas. And just to give you an idea of the magnitude of demand on specific projects with wind farms and ethanol, those wind farm projects that we've seen recently, can range anywhere from 200,000 tons up to 700,000 tons, depends on the size of the wind farm. You get concrete pads that they need to put under the turbines themselves and then what you have to do is create roadways to get out there to build and service those turbines. An ethanol plant is going to be connected to rail in virtually every case and when you take the plant and the rail connection, not unusual that you are looking between 50,000 tons and 100,000 tons and could even be a little higher.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Got it. Thanks for that, but --.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: And just one more question if I can, I mean you are talking about the second half coming back and it certainly sounds like you are expecting that some of what the government is doing right now be helpful in that, both in the fiscal sense and monitory sense, but is there anything else that you are seeing out there that makes you feel like the second half is going to see an improvement or is it sort of based on the idea that the economy is just going to start coming back, the back half of the year?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think its that plus a key factor in all of this is the confidence level of consumers which translates into the confidence level of developers and lenders. If in fact you have a higher confidence level, you are going to see people much more inclined to move forward on projects and big swing factor for 2008 is in commercial construction in our view, and we had already talked about housing. We think it will be down for the year, with a little bit of uptrend in the back half. We think the infrastructure component of business will be up modestly. What swings our volumes between a slight plus and potentially 3% negative as we see it today, is going to be that non-rails construction and the level of confidence, particularly as it relates to office building, distribution and retail will play a major role in that. So, that's where we are looking at.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: And just, if I can just follow-up on that real quick, you mentioned last quarter that a lot of the developing markets seem to have taken a cautionary pause and that seems to be kind of sort of the same language in terms of the confidence there. Have you seen some of that caution abate or is the caution still out there and you are just hopeful that it's going to abate going forward?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's still out there right now and I don't think we are going to get a reasonable read on it until we get into the midst of the second quarter, where based on seasonal patterns, volume typical picks up. I don't think we are going to get much to read on anything in the first quarter.
Todd Vencil - Davenport & Company: Got it. Fine thanks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure
Operator: Next up, with Longbow Research we've David MacGregor.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Hi, this is Garik Shmois for David. You mentioned Texas and the Carolinas with respect to construction spending. Can you just talk about some of the other markets where you might be particularly positive for 2008?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think Georgian infrastructure will have another good year. I think Indiana infrastructure will have a good year in the midst of all the other issues that are taking place out there with employment around automotive. Those will be the two most notable; Virginia withdrawing that category, they've got a new $3 billion bond issue. That has been approved and I think you are going to see Virginia begin to pick up after some pretty low levels of spending in that state. We don't have a big chunk of Maryland, but Maryland likewise stepped up and increased their annual funding of highways by roughly $400 million and that should be a plus there. Lot of activity going on in the states and I think over the next 12 to 18 months, you are going to see many of the states take additional actions to fund their programs and they literally don't have much choice unless they want to be grazing cows in the interstates.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Can you talk about some of those actions that they are looking at?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the actions that they are looking at are increased bond funding, where they have the capacity to do that, not only at the state level, but you can see it... and continue to see the local area bond funding initiatives, both for transportation and particular for schools at the local level, and those are good demand items for us. You are looking at this revenue, we call, I think they like to refer to them as revenue enhancers, I think it's called more taxes. The reality is that you are seeing increases, not on the gasoline tax, but on registration fees, transfer taxes and I think you are going to see the states go to that pretty heavily because they know that over the long-term that the gasoline tax is not going to be the vehicle to pay for roads as it is structured today, particularly with the new fuel requirements that the Congress has mandated.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Well, thank you for that detail. Can you talk about your CapEx forecast for 08?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. CapEx in 2007, about $265 million, 2008 is going to be very similar and it's going to be driven by the big project we have going on in Augusta, which will be somewhere between $50 million to $55 million and the significant majority of that spending will be in 08. And it's driven by relatively heavy expenditure on mobile equipment, just based on aging issues, turnover that we have there. So we'll see those as the leading elements. As we get beyond 2008, I would expect that mobile component come down pretty significantly. We will continue to have some fairly heavy land expenditures investing in the future of our reserve base and we'll probably have at least one really big plant project going on at the same time. But if we get beyond 08, you might see that number come down at 10% or so.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Okay. And then just lastly, you've talked about a 1000 [ph] basis point margin improvement forecast. Do you really forecast today and is there anything you see out there that gives you pause or reasons for concerns?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We really believe that, that's there, if you give some truly appurtenant behavior in the U.S. economy for extended period of time that would make it more difficult. But what we said in the beginning was that we expected to get the 1000 basis points over five years, the 2005 was a base line, we're two years in and we're at 440 basis points. 2008 will be challenging in that regard, no question about it, with volume levels really being the key there. I think we will do a pretty good job on our cost as we have been doing. But we also said in the very beginning that its not 200 basis points a year, you are going to see more when the market's up and less when the market's down. And in our view is an expectation that we see the market begin to trend up or certainly in 09 and 2010 likely to be very good year with respect to volume and margins, as we look at it today. So yes, I would reiterate that we continue to have that as a primary focus point for us.
Garik Shmois - Longbow Research: Great, thank you very much and good luck.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take the question from John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Hello everyone. I've a couple of questions. I guess first Steve, do you have break down on shipments by end market, infrastructure, residential et cetera?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We haven't finalized it, John. We are working through the final stages of that. We will have it shortly. What I can tell you is, as you would expect housing drop sharply and commercial ramped up sharply and a ramp up in the percentage that goes to infrastructure. But we'll give those final numbers very shortly.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Okay, great. Can you just tell us what you know about the update in Florida, and Lake Belt and what's going on with pricing in aggregates in Florida?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Nothing new on the Lake Belt that you haven't already seen publicly.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Right.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So we have no idea what the timing maybe down there or what their decision will be. With respect to pricing, the Miami area producers have been pretty aggressive. But when you take out 25% of the capacity, you are in a position to do that.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Great.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: They have pushed prices, they had a $5 increase beginning of the fourth quarter and they announced another $5 beginning in the year.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Right.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We'll see how that all works out. There has been talk of an additional increase by mid-year.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Okay. And so I clarify, in the buyback you said, you wanted to continue that and get up in your range which would be 2 to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA, is that correct?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know us well, we lay out targets and then we really seek to make the targets and that's our target range, it's carefully thought through. Actually, if we had... the only reason we wanted it right there for 2007 is that share buyback at the end of the year, the last three days didn't settled until calendar 08 otherwise we would have been right at 2.0.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So you should have an expectation that we are going to be on the target range in 2008.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Okay. And do you see, given all the stress out there in the world today, acquisition opportunities in this environment?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not many, I mean we continue to look at some small ones. We had indicated, we have an interest in, what Vulcan is going to divest.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Sure.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But that's Vulcan's call as to what they do there. We continue to look but we also continue to do what we've been doing and that is to invest organically where we think we just have exceptional opportunities and then we weigh it up between buying Martin and buying some other things, we kind of like ourselves.
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: And John, we've had some good opportunities to acquire additional properties in 2007 and also we expect that in 2008.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Reserve properties.
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Right, reserve properties.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Right, you mean land?
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Yes.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so we continue to invest for the long-term in the business, I think we have made some key land moves and we have some more in the plan for 2008, we are going stay on that because that is your 50 year cash flow.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Right, that's in the CapEx number, right?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Yes.
John Fox - Fenimore Asset Management: Alright, thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: From Goldman Sachs, we move on to Ajay Kejriwal.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Wondering if you could maybe clarify a little bit on that pricing guidance 5.5% to 7.5%, sounds like you have the bottom end already implemented and could get to the top end if you get volume. Is that the right way to think about it or there is more that could be implemented later this year?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think we will see additional price increases this year, certainly not anything significant. Much will rest on where the volume comes from because there is a significant prosperity between pricing, between truck quarries and long-haul distribution yards and there is significant range between areas of the country. So it's going to be transportation mix and geographic mix, I think that will be the determining factors as to where we wind up.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So... and this is more of a hypothetical question. I want to understand the sensitivity around pricing with respect to volume. So if volume were to decline more than your 3%, the bottom end of your range. Would you still get 5.5 pricing or there could be some leakages there?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Unless the world turns upside down totally, which we think we've given you a valid range with any kind of reasonable assumptions about volume; the key consumer in this equation in terms of pushback is the ready mix concrete producer. And if you look at what's happened to them in the last two years, but particularly the last year, they've gone from being very busy with very attractive margins to a point where with a loss of the home building volume, they've seen volumes come down sharply in just that area of the country. So very difficult to pass along much in the way of price increases to ready mix concrete guys at this point, to the extent we get some pick up in the economy should benefit them first and actually make 2009 pricing a little bit more attractive or easier to implement at least.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Moving to the Carolinas, sounds like volume declined 28% in December and part of that was weather-related. Would you get some of that back in the first quarter or that's more a second, third quarter kind of phenomenon?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think you're going to get back in first quarter and the reason is pretty simple. When contractors have overwhelming backlogs, they work in weather conditions at normally which shut them down. They don't have overwhelming backlogs, that's just a fact of the economy. So I think what you're going to see the contractors do, is they're going to look for more optimal working conditions because when they crank up and go to work, they want to get efficiency out of their workforce, they want to feel comfortable that they are going to get long work days. So I would expect that they are going to push out in the first quarter, they are going to take their time as far as opening up to new projects that they have and in effect, face out the backlog to see if the second half develops in a positive way, just what we talked about earlier.
Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next up, with UBS we have Timna Tanners.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Yes hi. Wanted to ask if you can talk about volume discipline and its been a couple of years now, volumes easing a bit, and wondered if your fellow quarry owners are also contracting volumes consistently as they have in recent years?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly, as far as we know, we have seen a general down drift in aggregate demand and that's a function predominantly of housing. I don't know of any of the significant players that haven't experienced that. You may have a small player somewhere who has a special situation, but certainly the larger, more geographically diverse players have seen it. Q4 '07 was the seventh consecutive down... down quarter volume and we would expect as we go into Q1 of '08 that that's going to be a down volume quarter. We have already said first half down volume, you know Q2 we will talk about it we get here, but certainly nothing roughing going on in the first half that's going to lift volumes up significantly. Everybody's seeing it and the nice thing about the aggregates business unlike let's say, cement or lime where you get 24x7 operations is that you can't shut your plants down. You can reduce the hours, you can adjust your production schedule and to some degree, your cost run rate based on the volume of demand and certainly, that's what we are doing and that's what we are seeing others do.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay great. And then also just wanted to ask about the very political, obviously, but can you tell us about what the industry is doing and how preemptive the industry has been regarding the highway trust funds and addressing the imbalance there?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's interesting to us that the federal government wants to throw somewhere between a $150 billion and $180 billion at the consumer, which I personally view as a stimulus plan for China as opposed to investing in America and maybe that gives us some insight into the short-term versus long-term nature of our politicians. We are sitting here with infrastructure needs are just absolutely overwhelming and the track record on infrastructure investment is that $1 billion of that kind of investment creates 47,000 jobs and if not $6 to $8 an hour jobs, these are jobs that can be $15 to $40 an hour. So certainly, the industry is trying to make its voice heard. There seems to be a fair amount of deafness at the political level, and I am sure that relates to the fact that we've got a November election coming and politicians are what they are, particularly the ones that are running for office right now. So we are going to continue to found a way at it at some point back to grazing cows on the interstates comment I made earlier, they are going to get it and they are going to make the moves. Historically, they have done it. They have typically been late. We've got the safety issue that has been pointedly ramped home with the I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis. So I think there is plenty of thought for discussion out there. I think the states are going to continue to lead as opposed to federal Government, and frankly, the states are leading on a lot of things. The Federal government seems to be caught up in itself particularly with the political bickering that goes on between two parties.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Where it all goes, Timna at the end of it, historically, they reauthorize late, but I would expect the democrats are going to sweep at the congressional level certainly based on everything we see today. If that is the case and we were to get a Republican President, the Democrats are generally much more infrastructure friendly and focused and I would expect that they are going to have a veto proof majority.
Timna Tanners - UBS: Okay, very helpful, thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. That bodes well.
Operator: Next, we move on to Clyde Lewis with Citi.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Good afternoon, Steve. Two questions, if I may. First, maybe on the statement, you were talking about some of the polished [ph] way of polished from the chemical grade agro just starting looking pretty positive. Can you just sort of refer, because some movements is going... to bit detail in terms of some of volume, you are talking about there on the spot [ph] pricing versus the more and how attractive [ph] you are selling in but now attractive that is? And the second one I had was, most probably more for Anne, in terms of the sort of other items both for the operating and non-operating level, can you just remind us what was really sort of one-off nature last year that's unlikely to repeat in 2008?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Why don't we start with financial question, I'll let Anne answer that and I will come back for the market question.
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Yes Clyde. That's particularly in the other operating kind of expenses that are generally... except in property sales, land sales and also except the equipment or surplus equipment sales. That number ranges in that kind of $10 million to $12 million a year guideline and we just actually had a couple more larger property sales this year than we have last. So it has become sometimes opportunity depending on the buyer.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay. And then in the non-operating arm, that was... the kind of one-off disposals [indiscernible].
Anne H. Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer: The non-operating margin is primarily revenue generation from our non-consolidated investments, particularly, our investment in a concrete company in North Carolina, they had a very good year and we get our share of their earning. So I don't consider that to be one-off; they had a pretty good track record and have a good vision for 2008 offset.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay, great thanks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, if you look at balance chemical grade and the other components of that other category is agriculture land. You know the chemical grade opportunity for us certainly should be 0.5 million as much as 1 million tons better in '08. than it was in '07. We picked up some contracts in '07, but we didn't get full year benefit. So we are very positive about chemical grade stone going to flue gas desulphurisation. Railroad balance, the pressure on the railroads is eased off a little bit, but the railroads continue to invest at a very significant level. And their track edge and actually they're getting an opportunity to do little bit more if they choose, simply because they get more leeway because of little less traffic and opportunity to do it. So we expect a good year there. The agriculture lime business is interesting because that's mid-western business for the most part, that's where the high demand is. And actually that December weather hurt us pretty badly, with respect to agriculture lime at Iowa in particular. When you get that kind of weather, the farmers can't spread lime and they really can't get into fields to do that until the weather clears. Given the farm incomes, historically, the farmers spend heavily on ag lime when their incomes are up and certainly, they are at record level incomes with price of corn and soybeans. So, we would expect a very good agricultural lime season, your pricing on those products, when you sum them up, they are in the range close to our average selling price for all products. Now there will be regional variances, but they're not going to be much off the mark there.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay, thanks a lot. One more, if I may, a quick one, the weather patterns in January '08 were they mostly different to January '07 most of your markets?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We won't comment on weather until we get to the end of the quarter. We will let you look at the weather maps, you can get that off the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration's weather map, and they will display that for you month-by-month, sort of a good way to look at it, in terms of temperatures and precipitation.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Rather than us comment, I'll send you to the genuine source and then if it's an issue, we will talk about impacts on us at the end of the quarter.
Clyde Lewis - Citigroup: Okay, thanks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next up, we have Steve Farley with Farley Capital.
Steve Farley - Farley Capital: Yes. I want to go back to the price increases in Florida, which seem quite significant. If I sort of do my math correctly, if you do 2% of your volume of Florida that's maybe something like 4 million tons and the prices have gone up $10 a ton in Florida that will be an extra $40 million fee, which is almost a $1 a share pre-tax. What are you assuming in the guidance you have given us... what are you assuming with regard to prices in Florida and where in fact are your prices today in Florida?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, when I referenced pricing in Florida, I was specific to talk about the Miami area and we don't produce in the Miami area. So... and we don't market significantly in the Miami area. So, the benefits of that level of price increase goes directly to the producers who are there in that area because of the shut down of capacity. From there, there are shipments will come out of the Miami area, there are also shipments in two other parts of the state. into the central part, even all the way up to Jacksonville and over toward Tampa, and then you begin to have shipments coming in by water and shipments coming in by rail, which is where we participate. And certainly, we are going to see some level of price increase. I referenced the fact that that is one of our better opportunities, but it's nowhere close to what the Miami area producers have an opportunity to get, just simply based on their location. So, don't do a quick math on that one and bring that to the bottom line because that certainly will not be case for us, it'll be good but not that good.
Steve Farley - Farley Capital: So what have you done in your markets in Florida in prices, both October 1 and January 1, if anything?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've raised prices, but I'm not going to break it out for you specifically on those markets. I'll just... I will say that the rate of increase for us down there is certainly above our average that we've laid out as our target for the year. It's one of the better opportunities.
Steve Farley - Farley Capital: And what's your outlook in terms of volumes in Florida? Might you increase your volumes also?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We think there's certainly a possibility of that depending upon what ultimately happens with this Lake Belt litigation. So, we're poised to do that, expectation that we will pick up some volume.
Steve Farley - Farley Capital: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll take Chris Manuel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning or good afternoon, I guess.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, afternoon.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: It's been a long day. First question I had for you was kind of follow-on to an earlier question. When we look at the comparisons in the first and second quarter of the year, your first and second quarter, you had volumes that were down closer to 15% I think in the first quarter and a little under 10% in the second. When we kind of compare that to what you are anticipating for full year, should we... before they get pick-ups then later to 07should we anticipate that vis-à-vis down 1 to up 3 range for the full year, that it could be down something closer to the mid single-digits in the first couple of quarters of the year or can you help us a little bit of the timing?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's possible that we could be down that much, I would not expect that right now, what I hope that we would do better than that.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But that's a possibility. It's just practically quite unpredictable and not as much visibility as we like particularly with when contractors are actually going to go to work on the backlogs that they have. If you go back last year and you look at the volume declines, it was 15% first quarter, 9% second, 4% third and 5%, little better than that, 5.5% in fourth quarter. We had anticipated that fourth quarter was going to be better and that progression of volume decline that it would be less than the decline in Q3 and certainly as we've outlined, it was well on track through October, November, we were plus one. We actually anticipated a down December, would have expected the volume would have been down 3% to 5% for that month and we got the 19% volume decline, which was predominately weather-driven. As we come into Q1 and Q2, I think what you have articulated hopefully is a worse case and that we seek something that is little better than that as a starting point.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's helpful.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then my second question was have you seen any other push back or deferrals in any of the infrastructure projects in other states than the ones you've mentioned that only can have two ways. First is, you indicated there were some state budget issues, which sounded like some projects may have been pushed back a bit maybe I am reading into that, and the second question with that was have there been any other potential push backs or delays in any of your industrial projects or other commercial projects?
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Now on the infrastructure side, other than what we talked about, nothing that's really of note. On the commercial side, the answer is yes, which is why we made the comment last quarter about seeing some things that were little different. People are cautious right now and developers are measuring very carefully when they get started. Because once they start and break ground, it's difficult for them to pull back. So we will see projects that are scheduled to start at a particular time and you're measuring these things in weeks or maybe even months in terms of when they actually begin or the projects going away, I'm not saying, going away, just a question of deferral and the timing for developers to build what they are building and in some cases they are just not impacted at all because they are so capacity-driven and people that are doing the projects are so long-term that they are just going to move refinery projects, there are lots of activity related to energy.
Christopher D. Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Next, we will take Dan Oppenheim with Banc of America Securities.
Michael Wood - Banc of America Securities: Hi, this is Mike Wood. Can you just tell how close that you are monitoring the pricing strategies of competitors, particularly maybe the private home builders and whether or not are you seeing any changes in the trends how... what kind of price increases they're trying to get compared to yourself and if there is any specific examples in markets would be helpful? Thanks.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well there's certainly no correlation between the pricing by home builders and pricing in the aggregates business.
Michael Wood - Banc of America Securities: I am sorry, I meant the private aggregate companies.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. The private aggregate companies historically in a downturn tend to be more aggressive. I think that's just the reality for them. Have we seen anything that's unexpected, not really. They do what they normally do, the nice thing that's happened over time is that there has been a lot of consolidation. The public players, I think are much more financially oriented and probably spend a lot of time during their market analysis, probably much better tuned in to what's going on in a market as opposed to just looking at their core shipments by day, and seeing them go down for 5 straight days and beginning to think that perhaps it's something that they are doing or not doing as opposed to the market changing. So it all comes back to analytics at the end of the day. We certainly spend a lot of time trying to assess the demand in our markets, trying to assess where our competitors are and certainly there is a lot of fire fighting going on over volume opportunities. But at the same time, if you run your math, there is always so far out where you can reach because of the transportation advantage, where it makes sense for you on cost basis. So that's one of the beauties of our industry, it is very much transportation sensitive, so if you have location advantage, then you have an opportunity to get the better pricing.
Michael Wood - Banc of America Securities: Thank You.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure
Operator: Next question will come from Barry Vogel with Barry Vogel & Associates.
Barry Vogel - Barry Vogel & Associates: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My questions have been answered. Thank you
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay Barry.
Operator: There are no more question in the queue. Now I will turn things back over to our speakers for any further or concluding comments they may have.
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, well again we thank you for joining us today. I will just characterize this interesting times, we are going to stay focused on the cost management, I think it's the time when that demands in order we focus. Certainly we are hopeful that we will see some pick-up in volumes by the second half at the latest, and with that we might now expect turning out another good year and we will talk to you about first quarter results on at the end of April. Thanks for joining us.
